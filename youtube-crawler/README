Get the API Key
================
Go to this link - https://console.developers.google.com
1. In the library panel, search for the YouTube Data API v3. Click into the listing for that API and make sure the API is enabled for your project.
2. In the credentials panel, create an API key You will use the API key to make API requests that do not require user authorization. For example, you do not need user authorization to retrieve information about a public YouTube channel.
3. Store the API key in a file called 'key.txt' - currently it contains a dummy key. Please do not put anything else other than the key itself in the file


Installation
==============
The following libraries need to be installed in your system for using the crawler
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client

pip install --upgrade google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2


Running
=========
1. Update the videos.txt file with your own YouTube Video links - currently it contains links only for testing
2. If you want to crawl the whole channel, create channels.txt and give the channel ids there (one id per line)
3. In order to start from scratch delete the old file from inside the two directories 'csv-data-youtube' and 'xml-data-youtube' and delete all entries from 'youTubeLinks.tsv'. You may also completely delete these directories and the TSV files - the crawler will create those again for you.
3. Run youtubecrawler.py - it will create both XML and CSV versions of the corpus
