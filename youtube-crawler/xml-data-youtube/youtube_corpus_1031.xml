               <original_script name="Roman">BBC bias laid bare by the Ian Austin interview on 7 November. The BBC showed an extreme bias in the Today programme. The tirade by Ian Austin against the labour leadership was given an inordinate amount of prominence. He was given eleven minutes to recite his tirade urging voters not to vote Labour. He is not an MP and not standing for parliament. He had left the Labour party 9 months ago and has been appointed by the Tory government as a trade envoy to Israel. It is therefore not surprising and not newsworthy that someone with a political appointment for the conservatives should advocate voting for the Tories. None of this came out in this interview nor in the news summary that incorporated this interview nor in Martha Kearney interview of Rebecca Long Bailey. This event was mentioned three times in the space of about half an hour. This is totally biased ‘reporting’ and breaks the rules of impartiality by the BBC during an election campaign that has a short duration. I would welcome an apology from the BBC and an acknowledgment that a serious error of judgement was made on this occasion and that in future such blatant bias should be carefully avoided.</original_script>

Instead, it&amp;#39;s about making sure a larger proportion of the budget goes to other places rather than just London and the South East. How is it fair that London gets major projects like Crossrail and Heathrow third runway when they cut funding for improving railways in the North?(which is already in dire need of money) The UK is more than just London and the South East ya know.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">@James T - nope the referendum was deemed fair by the electoral commission. Aaron Banks was cleared too.. 86% of MPs voted to deliver Brexit on invoking Article 50. We knew the pros and cons then. We all know both sides lied. Remainers said they would honour the referendum result in their manifestos, but reneged on that promise.. Remember, It was a &amp;quot;once a generation&amp;quot; vote as the holder of the referendum said, (thats every 30 years). Only those that want to give the losing side another shot want a second ref. I voted to leave not cos of some daft slogan on a bus, but to leave the CU, leave the SM, regain control over our laws, and restore our sovereignty. Nothing else. Thats why Brexit is and is being fulfilled. Democracy cannot function unless the losing side concede. Moderate Remainers did in 2016, its just the extremists that have contempt for democracy that are the problem.</original_script>
