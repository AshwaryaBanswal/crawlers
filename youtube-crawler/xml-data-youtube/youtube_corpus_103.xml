            <video_title>Trump lifts sanctions on Turkey over Syria assault - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>The US is lifting sanctions imposed on Turkey nine days ago over its offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, President Donald Trump says.

His decision came after Russia agreed with Turkey to deploy troops to extend a ceasefire along the Syrian border.

Turkey's assault began after Mr Trump's unexpected move to withdraw US troops from northern Syria earlier this month.

&quot;Let someone else fight over this long bloodstained sand,&quot; the president said in a TV address from the White House.

He was heavily criticised by both Democrats and Republicans for the abrupt military pullout, as the Kurds targeted by Turkey had been key US allies in the fight against the Islamic State group (IS) in the region.

            <comment_content_initial>Linguists say that he speaks at a 5th grade (10 year old’s) level. I’d say that’s a bit generous. Trump is fond of saying that he “has the best words” — unfortunately, those words are all “me, me, me, me, me, me, ME.” I miss the days when we had intelligent, articulate, *sane* presidents.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Khadr Trudeau I still stand by what I said. You can put labels all you want but until a candidate runs on a communist platform, I&amp;#39;ll admit I&amp;#39;m wrong. Bernie Sanders has described himself as a socialist but doesnt run as a socialist party. Hes an independent and a progressive, his platform and ideas prove that much. Hes far from what a communist would want in all honesty, hes too much on reforming capitalism.&lt;br /&gt;AOC is a democrat and her platform puts her as pretty progressive as well. If you read her platform, which is readily available online, she is more about civil and economic rights that, again, want to reform capitalism.  A far cry from communists. &lt;br /&gt; No communist has been in a seat of power in contemporary times. &lt;br /&gt;Second, Iraq and Vietnam have similarities but are not the same conflict. The fight in Iraq is multiple more nuanced than Vietnam.  We are trying to prop up a nation while under the treat of people we cant overtly attack. In Vietnam, you had a conflict that didnt finish what they started, which was a political action that needed political conclusion.  Iraq, we are still in the process and this time we wont mess up. Finish what we started, nothing more, nothing less. That doesnt meant backing down from intl agreements either. Sadly, it&amp;#39;s up the US career diplomats and state service members who know what American values are. Our president doesnt understand the importance of professionalism in our civil service. There are ways of making things happen, he just doesnt understand how to utilize the government properly and hes paying the price now. Democrats are only doing what they have to, to check another branch of government when they overstep their own.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">@RebelDog :)))) being consistently  ignorant is a defect. But far from being an idiot. I think as a dealer and rich born individual he has managed to develop a different set of skills. Which helped him in his whole life. That&amp;#39;s why he never needed a more sophisticated, humane and logic approach. Because it always worked for him. But that doesn&amp;#39;t help him in connecting  with others and gaining admiration. I think that&amp;#39;s the actual case. Your president is an ignorant and arrogant business and show man. he will lead your country in his way of thinking during his presidency. Somehow I have the gut feeling he is the necessary evil (or troll).</original_script>

America needs to really start again with their education, not brainwash but education, if they want to fulfill the divine destiny so many hope in America. 
Now the limited world view and safe space is being used against your fellow Americans.
And isolation didn´t work either after ww1 the crime rate and suicide sky rocketed.
Atleast back then you had the world to blaim cause they didn´t listen to you.
But now you can´t go into isolation cause that would tear the country apart.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">It&amp;#39;s a shame that most of you dont truly know what&amp;#39;s going on. Most of you think they are killing kurds. That they are against kurds. No, that&amp;#39;s not it. In fact, they have 12 million kurds living in Turkey. Turkey who has has the most Syrian refugees, 2 to 4 million and European counties struggle with thousands. They want to re-settled them to north of Syria, back to their homeland. They want to protect their border, by the pkk, who if you dont know have killed hundreds of Turks in turkey who has also been trained in Syria. They are identified as terrorist by nato, usa, uk and more. Whats wrong with Turkey protecting themselves. They&amp;#39;ve changed their name yet they are the same group. There is video footage of us officials admitting they are the same. It&amp;#39;s not right with replacing terrorist (issis) with another terrorist(pkk). Why do you think trump said they are not Angel&amp;#39;s, that they could be worse than isis. The only reason why no one knows about this is lack of media attention tion and how the media does not explain it. They dont explain why turkey thinks they are terrorist or who else thinks they are territory. Or how they train children to train soldiers or how they attack from holy buildings. Now you tell me, is turkey still doing wrong.</original_script>

            <comment_content_initial>It's a shame that most of you dont truly know what's going on. Most of you think they are killing kurds. That they are against kurds. No, that's not it. In fact, they have 12 million kurds living in Turkey. Turkey who has has the most Syrian refugees, 2 to 4 million and European counties struggle with thousands. They want to re-settled them to north of Syria, back to their homeland. They want to protect their border, by the pkk, who if you dont know have killed hundreds of Turks in turkey who has also been trained in Syria. They are identified as terrorist by nato, usa, uk and more. Whats wrong with Turkey protecting themselves. They've changed their name yet they are the same group.

Kuwait asked the USA to kick Iraqi troops out. They were the ones that invaded. Also, are you not aware that the USA is also one of the largest producers and exporters of oil? Frankly, many other countries are highly dependent on middle east oil. The USA could easily survive without it, while others would collapse economically, and you seem to be unaware that the nations that export oil GET PAID for it, and are also dependent on that income, or their governemnts would also collapse.&lt;br /&gt;Trump also makes the point that fighting has been going on there since long before the USA existed or oil was discovered.

               <original_script name="Roman">@nature albums we are about 40million not 20. And yeah that is correct but guess what, the ottoman empire was defeated by the brits, so brits shouldve decided on the borders from your logic, which they did but ataturk made a deal with brits and so brits did nit create a kurdish country. Both brits and ottomans had promised a homeland back then if they helped but guess what, they got backstabbed by both. Turkey would be weak without its kurds, about 30% of turkey is kurdish plus all the other kurds from iraq, iran, syria that would almost be equal to the amount of turks. And yeah most turks are genetically greek and stuff cause those are the peoples lands they conqoured. In the past ottomans had a lot of help from the kurds. But now they are treated bad by turks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slowly us kurds will unite and rise to form a free kurdish country, away from oppressors and tyrants like erdogan. Iraq has already gained autonomy, they even have a stromg military that could match up to iraq. Soon all the other kurds will follow. And then we will see what you say then. Kurds honestly deserve a homeland, without kurds isis would still be around many would be killed. We sacrificed our people for the protection of all our middle eastern brothers but some of them like turkey backstabbed us while we were defending them. You lot attacked us while we were defending north syria from isis and driving them out.</original_script>
