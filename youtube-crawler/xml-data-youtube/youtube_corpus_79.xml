Earthquakes can systematically trigger other ones on opposite side of Earth (antipodes)

antipode earthquakes on the opposite sides of the planet

Marker height off the globe represents depth into the Earth.

When an earthquake strikes, you will hear a rumble, ding, and a bell toll. The bell will toll the number of times = to the earthquake which occurs. (example : M4.0 will ring 4 times).

The most recent earthquake has a green placemark / flag on it.

Blue flag / placemark = the last earthquake which was looked up

I had read somewhere that if the undersea volcano off the coast of Oregon erupted it could possibly cause the big quake that's right at the door.

The following info is from National Geographic where you can find the entire article .  I just picked a couple of parts I thought were  interesting and important .
