            <video_title>Iraq unrest: Protesters attack Iranian consulate in Karbala - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>At least three people were reportedly shot dead when protesters attacked the Iranian consulate in the Iraqi holy city of Karbala on Sunday night.

The protesters, who demanded that Iran stop interfering in Iraq's internal affairs, climbed the consulate's walls.

There were reports that the security forces opened fire, but another account said unknown gunmen were responsible.

It came as mass demonstrations against Iraq's government continued in Baghdad despite a plea from the prime minister.
