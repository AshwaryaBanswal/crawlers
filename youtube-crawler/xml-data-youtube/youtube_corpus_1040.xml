            <video_title>Chilean President Piñera 'will not resign' [Full Interview] - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>Speaking to the BBC's South America correspondent, Katy Watson, President Sebastián Piñera has said he will not resign despite the mass anti-government protests.

The demonstrations were originally triggered by a now-suspended rise in the price of metro fares in Santiago.

Protesters are now marching to express their discontent over a wide variety of problems.

               <original_script name="Roman">Great interview of president Piñera, clear and solid. The journalist thinks that things in Chile are handle like in Venezuela or in a dictatorship. We are the very opposite of  what I just mention, we are a strong democracy and we respect the state of law. Everything that she asks is related with human rights and all that is guaranteed in Chile (the same president called all international institutions to come and investigate and everyone  who has been caught up has a trial as it should be). She only focuses into the few abuses of force agaisnt the extremist and violent people instead of the social movement (not to say that she does not put in account that so far 900 cops have been injured by the protesters ). In the rest of the interview she only tries to create controversy and  desinformation (at least she is learning at first hand that her own feelings and observations are not enough to generalized a situation in a foreign country ). People lacks rational analysis and they rapidly arrived  to wrong conclusion based on their feelings or background conditioning. Chile will stand up again as it did after the 2010 earthquake (8.8Mw), our resilience and will to overcome crisis make us stronger everytime.</original_script>

            <comment_content_initial>Great interview of president Piñera, clear and solid. The journalist thinks that things in Chile are handle like in Venezuela or in a dictatorship. We are the very opposite of  what I just mention, we are a strong democracy and we respect the state of law. Everything that she asks is related with human rights and all that is guaranteed in Chile (the same president called all international institutions to come and investigate and everyone  who has been caught up has a trial as it should be). She only focuses into the few abuses of force agaisnt the extremist and violent people instead of the social movement (not to say that she does not put in account that so far 900 cops have been injured by the protesters ). In the rest of the interview she only tries to create controversy and  desinformation (at least she is learning at first hand that her own feelings and observations are not enough to generalized a situation in a foreign country ). People lacks rational analysis and they rapidly arrived  to wrong conclusion based on their feelings or background conditioning. Chile will stand up again as it did after the 2010 earthquake (8.8Mw), our resilience and will to overcome crisis make us stronger everytime.</comment_content_initial>
