            <video_title>Harry Dunn crash: US diplomat's wife 'devastated' by death - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>The US diplomat's wife granted immunity after the crash which killed teenager Harry Dunn is &quot;devastated by the tragic accident&quot;, her lawyer has said.

Anne Sacoolas's legal representative, Amy Jeffress, said she would &quot;continue to co-operate with the investigation&quot;.

Mrs Sacoolas, 42, left for the US under diplomatic immunity despite being a suspect in the crash with Mr Dunn, 19, in Northamptonshire on 27 August.

But the Foreign Office said, having gone home, she no longer has immunity.

A statement issued on behalf of Mrs Sacoolas, whose husband worked at RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire, said: &quot;Anne is devastated by this tragic accident.

&quot;No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn's family.&quot;

            <comment_content_initial>@Fonzie They would likely charge her with some kind of higher tier traffic offence.
She was driving on the wrong side of road so there is grounds for causing death by dangerous / reckless driving.
Hence consequences in the way of a prison sentence, which would of probably been suspended.
But she fled the country like a coward so justice has not been served.</comment_content_initial>

            <comment_content_initial>I get it but wake up; you don't get to have arbitrary rules as it suits you.
*99.999% of the people outraged and spouting off with the claim of the moral high ground would accept the protection of immunity as well.*
She didn't make a formal declaration of immunity, the embassy and later state department cited it to the British government *and they honored it from square 1 upon arriving at the scene of the accident.* 
*The ultimate reality is if you are genuinely outraged, pursue rescinding participation in the 1961 Vienna Convention.*
Nobody with a realistic view of how the world works and the destruction their life would face isi going to return to England after the fact and face going to a prison let alone a foreign one.</comment_content_initial>

Absolutely shameful behavior, and our government should tell her to go back, face the consequences, and can’t return until the UK government releases her.  

I can’t imagine the parents thoughts as they land here in the states, heartbreaking.

               <original_script name="Roman">@The Moto Scotsman Yeah, totally agree - it&amp;#39;s a complete disgrace, to say the very least, and I can&amp;#39;t get my head around much of it (not just the fleeing from the UK, but the disturbingly lax attitude of the US government, and particularly Trump, with his idiotic and insensitive comments). I think part of the problem is, when attempting to even describe how terrible this whole scenario is, words (either spoken or written) just generally don&amp;#39;t get anywhere near its sheer gravity, due to them mainly coming across as clichés, even though they may be correct (such as: disgraceful, despicable, travesty, disgusting and shameful, etc, which are all way too soft in my opinion), and therefore lack sufficient impact. Charlotte Charles (understandably), when responding to Trump&amp;#39;s comments about it being &amp;quot;an accident&amp;quot; and &amp;#39;these things happen&amp;#39; (where he obviously missed the point completely), pretty much got it spot on, saying,  &amp;quot;IT&amp;#39;S BEYOND ANY REALM OF HUMAN THINKING.&amp;quot; However, THAT clearly relates to the whole story, especially where (as I understand it), the family were initially abandoned by the authorities after they discovered the woman had fled the UK, and were therefore left to pick up the pieces on their own - so unthinkable, and ultimately unforgivable, coupled with the above.</original_script>

            <comment_content_initial>@ stefan pereira: There's only one person who should be apologising and that is Anne Sacoolas (face to face in the UK with the grieving parents of Harry). 

As someone else has touched on, accidents do happen but that does not mean you are exempt from prosecution.
I very much doubt she will ever be extradited to the UK, and certainly won't come of her own volition.
While this does nothing for the UK/US relationship, my thoughts are with the parents of Harry, who have lost a son and have to accept that the person  responsible for his death will escape justice.


Shame on you Anne Sacoolas!</comment_content_initial>

3. England, Austrailia, New Zealand, Canada all have murder rates one tenth USA so America should study how they do it.
4. There are a number of countries in Africa with a lower murder rate than USA. Your are 15 times more likely to be murdered in the US than Botswana. YES 15 TIMES!!!  😈
- I bet you don't even know where Botswana is.  😂😂😂
5. America is the only country that guarantees the right to buy and store MURDER WEAPONS. Can you work out why the USA has a murder problem?
6. Drugs, drugs, drugs. What can I say.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">John -  Your laws allow someone to be criminally prosecuted and imprisoned for ten years, for causing a car accident, but you have criminals in London committing intentional murders with knives that get 3 years in prison?  Your courts are also unjustly imprisoning people under these hate speech laws, and one guy is facing 2 years in prison for posting a video of his dog giving a Nazi salute. You people need to join Tommy Robinson and start protesting against this tyrannical sht. The problem is, they&amp;#39;ll use these hate speech laws and charge you with inciting hatred for protesting against the hate speech laws. Don&amp;#39;t kid yourself, that government didn&amp;#39;t enact those laws, because they&amp;#39;r concerned about you getting insulted and having your feelings hurt, they have these laws to imprison and silence people like Tommy Robinson, or Jayda and Paul, that lead protests against their policies. They want to extinguish the fire before it starts raging and the protests escalate into uprisings and overthrow of their rule.  As for our murder rate, I&amp;#39;m not disagreeing, England has always had a lower murder rate than the US, even before they had gun control. The US has a 6% black male population that commits 52% of all murders, which England doesn&amp;#39;t have. Let us send these gang bangers to England and watch your murder rate go through the roof. Your gun control laws won&amp;#39;t keep these hombres from getting guns. In the inner city black areas such as Chicago, St. Louis, and Baltimore, they have strict gun control at the city level, comparable to the UK, and the highest gun murder rates in the US. &lt;br /&gt;   As for our high prison population, it&amp;#39;s due to one person, former President Ronald Reagan, that started his war on drugs back in the early 80&amp;#39;s. In the 1970&amp;#39;s if you got caught with an ounce or less of weed, it was a simple traffic fine, but in the 80&amp;#39;s the courts started sentencing people to prison for possession. A guy I used to know got caught carrying 8 joints in his luggage through DFW airport and the judge gave him 8 years in prison, a year for each joint. Times are now changing, and marijuana is being removed from the schedule one drug list, which includes heroin and cocaine. Many states are also legalizing pot, so we&amp;#39;re starting to see an end to this mass incarceration and waste of billions of tax dollars.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">@invidinvasion I can see your one of those people who think without logic. So thank you for finding my pain so amazing. I wish you health and happiness and most of all love and compassion... don&amp;#39;t worry I won&amp;#39;t wish this for you to share with others... I wish it only upon yourself... Wish we all had or have lived under your city of zero compassion city... no big deal heartless... &lt;br /&gt;Always this to help others to whom need it.. And I can see you waisted your time, this person who needed help with forgiveness and the power it does to ones life, so I bid you a good day.. and please be nice to those who are needing to be heard maybe only by the universe, but surely nobody needs your ill will and sad energy here... &lt;br /&gt;Oh well good health and happiness</original_script>

I wish you health and happiness and most of all love and compassion... don't worry I won't wish this for you to share with others... I wish it only upon yourself... Wish we all had or have lived under your city of zero compassion city... no big deal heartless... 
Always this to help others to whom need it.. And I can see you waisted your time, this person who needed help with forgiveness and the power it does to ones life, so I bid you a good day.. and please be nice to those who are needing to be heard maybe only by the universe, but surely nobody needs your ill will and sad energy here... 
Oh well good health and happiness</comment_content_initial>

An apology to grieving parents is wholly inappropriate as is the term causing 'death by careless driving' It's dangerous driving FFS. A careless driver might accidentally rear end you at traffic lights or dent your quarter panel whilst attempting to leave his/her parking space at the superstore's car park.

If it was the other way round and a uk citizen done that in America, our government would put them right on the next plane to the US.</comment_content_initial>

A 49-year-old man refused to pay his TV licence because he believed the BBC covered up facts about the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Tony Rooke, who represented himself today at Horsham Magistrates’ Court in West Sussex, said he did not want to give money to an organisation 'funding the practice of terrorism'.

Rooke, who admitted owning a TV and watching it without a licence, was found guilty of using an unlicensed set, given a six-month conditional discharge and told to pay £200 costs.


So he never won the case quite the opposite.


Forgetting 911, I find it outrageous that people in England have to have a TV Licence..


I am a journalist and find the idea of a fee to watch free television quite a contradiction.


Love Peace and Harmony,


Paul Connelly

She should not have to be extradited, she should face up to her actions Now!
She has no conscience, firstly she would not have run away.
Secondly she hasn't got a heart or she would be back in UK, in fact, should never have left it.
Shame on her.
I don't care who she is, what she is, it is not dissimilar in respects to Andrew, the Queens favourite son. 
He has no honour or conscience either. 
The proof is out there, get it, prosecute him and he should serve a very long sentence in a normal prison.
In some Countries, he would be beheaded, despite their so called Rulers allegedly known for similar proclivities doing it, yet ordinary people, Gay people are beheaded in a humiliating manner after first spending a lot of time in their gell holes and being tortured.
He should consider how lucky he is to live in UK.
She should consider her actions and their consequences.</comment_content_initial>

            <comment_content_initial>Dare I ask, her Diplomatic Immunity has been removed.
Why couldn't she fly to UK to see them?
After all, she used her POSITION to run away?
The excuses about driving on other side of the road etc
Thousands of UK Citizens go to US, Europe, other Countries.
First time I drove in France I kept reminding my brain about the correct lane.
I had 4 children eldest 15 plus their Father.
I had them to think of also other French Drivers who were nothing if not brilliant, noticing reg, indicating, you go.
I wonder was she alone or anyone with her?
I could well be wrong but I do not recall hearing if she had passengers.
I drove in Germany, in one of the busiest regions, going to fabulous pool complexes they have which you don't even know are there until you get to parking area, surrounded by beautiful trees.
I had 4 children with me, only one mine. Again I was very conscious of the children, but the other drivers were important if I got it wrong, they could lose their lives through my not being alert.
She should have taken responsibility.
My 2 brothers left with life effected and for a long time, life threatening leg injuries through hit and run. One was 16 stopped in inside lane in line of traffic. Authorities tried to convince my Father he fell off.
My Dad looked at his bike, saw coloured paint, had accident investigators do their stuff. He had indeed been stationery, if he fell off, why was his right thigh, leg and ankle in bits.

Like her he ran away knowing he had hit something pretty hard.
Thank God my brother survived, 3 operations in days, no expected to live. He did.
Their son didn't, and her message is very carefully worded.
In fact, it's meaningless.</comment_content_initial>
