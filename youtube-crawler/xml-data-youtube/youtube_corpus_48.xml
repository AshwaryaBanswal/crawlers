            <comment_content_initial>What about epst_ein though and the royals and politicians? They all linked and causing these wars
 If you consider that ep_ stein is blatantly liked to the Prince, who is blatantly linked to Jim sa _ville then this all started to come out before brexit and you could say that this entire brexit joke show has been to cover up the fact our country is run by a group of pea_dos. 
Distract the masses with a circus to drown out all other noise.
 Same with Russia and hillary clinton, the Russia thing only poped up after clinton and podesta and the pizza Gate thing. People mostly too dumb to notice the timings unfortunately</comment_content_initial>
