            <video_title>The artist cutting off the head of a British colonialist - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>It's been 200 years since Singapore was founded as a British port by Sir Stamford Raffles, and the country is marking the anniversary of his arrival with the Singapore Bicentennial, a series of events looking back on its history.

Many Singaporeans view Raffles with respect, and his name adorns some of the most prestigious institutions and places in the country.

But one artist, Jimmy Ong, wants to question Raffles' legacy and Singaporeans' admiration for a man they view as their city's colonial founder.

Video by Tessa Wong. Additional footage by Fahmi Jamal.

            <comment_content_initial>Why does the bbc keep pushing a left anti british opinion.
I will not be made to feel guilty for being british, for something our country did hundreds of years ago.
We were also the first country to ban slavery but I don’t see the bbc spreading this.
What matters is the actions of our country now and not what was done in the past by a society that was not as well educated on humanity as it is now.
This guilt trip culture is pathetic!</comment_content_initial>

It's British ideals that allow you the freedom  to do it in the first place.</comment_content_initial>
