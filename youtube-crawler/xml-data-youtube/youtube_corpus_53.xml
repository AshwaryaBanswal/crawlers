Marker height off the globe represents depth into the Earth.

When an earthquake strikes, you will hear a rumble, ding, and a bell toll. The bell will toll the number of times = to the earthquake which occurs. (example : M4.0 will ring 4 times).

The most recent earthquake has a green placemark / flag on it.

Blue flag / placemark = the last earthquake which was looked up

               <original_script name="Roman">The man who died was in Nevada. Not Ridgecrest. He was found pinned beneath his vehicle by Nye County Sheriffs. Of Nye County Nevada. Not Ridgecrest ,California. I double checked the newspaper article. So while getting the information out IS important---I am not sure a man in Nevada would have thought a Ca earthquake could have ever bothered him. Lost THAT battle of poor reasoning,I hope he passed quickly. As he WAS all alone.</original_script>
