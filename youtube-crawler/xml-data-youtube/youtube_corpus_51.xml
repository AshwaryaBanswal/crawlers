Earthquakes can systematically trigger other ones on opposite side of Earth (antipodes)

Marker height off the globe represents depth into the Earth.

When an earthquake strikes, you will hear a rumble, ding, and a bell toll. The bell will toll the number of times = to the earthquake which occurs. (example : M4.0 will ring 4 times).

The most recent earthquake has a green placemark / flag on it.

Blue flag / placemark = the last earthquake which was looked up

The Robber Barrons must not like how he has exposed the dire consequences of their deep drilling into the crust near volcanoes.
Deep drilling for oil and gas (that is, perforating the Craton) near the Carghill Salt Mine tunnels (located one mile under Lake Erie)  is especially dangerous, should an earthquake strike northern Ohio.
