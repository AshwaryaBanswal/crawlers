            <video_title>Lebanon's PM Saad Hariri resigning amid protests - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri has said he is resigning, amid protests that have gripped the country for two weeks.

Mr Hariri said Lebanon had reached a deadlock and needed a shock to break the crisis.

The protests began against now-scrapped plans to tax WhatsApp calls, but quickly widened to target political corruption and economic turmoil.

Lebanon has one of the highest debt levels in the world.

            <comment_content_initial>The 'powers of the [political] heavens will be shaken' Luke 21: 25, 26. This 'shaking' by Jehovah's 'earthquake' upon the present system Hebrews 12: 26-29 comes at a time of 'wrath' manifest Revelation 11: 18 Jeremiah 25: 24- 26. In Q4 of 2019, 25 places of serious rioting and protesting also shows a gradual financial fall that harps back to the FC of 2008. These places of protests are: 
Spain, Sudan, Russia, Egypt, Uganda, Indonesia, Ukraine, Peru, Hong Kong, Zimbabwe, Colombia, France, Turkey, Venezuela, The Netherlands, Ethiopia, Brazil, Malawi, Algeria, Iraq, Haiti, Ecuador, Lebanon, Chile,  and Guinea.
In Daniel's prophecy of the 'iron and the clay' in Daniel 2: 31-46 we see the 'iron-like' totalitarian governments and the 'clay-like' ordinary people; who want to have a say in matters of government, 'are not sticking together', just as iron is not sticking with clay. These protests and riots create the wrath of nations seen in Revelation 11: 18, along with the outbreak of wars and disorders, also visible. Jeremiah 25: 24-26.
Christ arrives like a 'Stone', that strikes the political system, rendering it to chaff upon the wind.Daniel 2: 34. 2Peter 2: 4 This is also seen in Matthew 24: 21, 22, 29, 30. The earthly Kingdom indicated in Daniel 2: 44 corresponds to God's Kingdom described in Matthew 24: 14; and the Paradise Christ described in Luke 23: 43.
The massive change that takes place at this time of wrath; financial meltdown Psalms 46: 6 and the interventions of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, written in detail in prophecy is the saving and rescue of faithful mankind John 3: 16 Revelation 7:9, 14-17 that results from our Creator Isaiah 45: 18 intervening in man's affairs to save us from being rendered extinct due to the events of the Great tribulation Matthew 24: 21, 22. &quot;Unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved.&quot;
As the King of God's Kingdom Revelation 11: 15, 18  Revelation 12: 10 Christ comes to save all those whom He has already died for in the first century. These 'sheep-like' persons Matthew 25: 31, 34 are greatly benefiting from this history written ahead of time by the God of love who CARES ABOUT US.  
Evil- doers who are unrepentant and expect to always be evil and wicked are destroyed Psalms 92: 7 bringing the Great tribulation to an END.
But meek and righteous ones who love God will POSSESS the earth; and live upon it forever in peace. Psalms 37: 11, 29. John 17: 3. John 3: 16.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">Daniel&amp;#39;s prophecy in Daniel 2: 31-46 there is &amp;#39;an immense image&amp;#39; that represents the political system. The &amp;#39;feet&amp;#39; of this image, where we are today, are made of iron and clay: &amp;quot; they will not prove to be sticking together, this one to that one, just as iron is not mixing with clay.&amp;quot; Daniel 2: 43.  We see the &amp;#39;hard&amp;#39; elements , the totalitarian political powers are not sticking with the &amp;#39;soft&amp;#39; clay-like elements, the ordinary people, who are demanding a say in matters of government. This is seen in the form of rioting, and large-scale protests. These people are protesting their governments; while they are feeling the effects of a financial distress that is affecting them personally. This financial crisis harps back to the FC of 2008. We see these protests and riots between ordinary people,  and police and military powers, in an increasing number of places. We see it in 25 places in the final quarter of 2019. These are:&lt;br /&gt;Spain, Sudan, Russia, Egypt, Uganda, Indonesia, Ukraine, Peru, Hong Kong, Zimbabwe, Colombia, France, Turkey, Venezuela, The Netherlands, Ethiopia, Brazil, Malawi, Algeria, Iraq, Haiti, Ecuador, Chile, Lebanon and Guinea.&lt;br /&gt;These &amp;#39;wrathful&amp;#39; events are also associated with the appearance of wars and wrath in Arab states Jeremiah 25: 24 and in Syria and Russia, as the &amp;#39;kings of north near and far&amp;#39; Jeremiah 25: 24-26 strut their stuff in a war in Syria now involving Turkey. The wrath of nations indicated in Jeremiah 25: 24-26 and including Revelation 11: 18 becomes a worldwide crisis.&lt;br /&gt;In Daniel&amp;#39;s prophecy a &amp;#39;Stone&amp;#39;, cut &amp;#39;not by hands&amp;#39; strikes the &amp;#39;image&amp;#39; on its feet. This is Christ Jesus 1Peter 2: 4- 8. This &amp;#39;Stone&amp;#39; was rejected by the builders, but was glorious in the sight of God. When the Kingdom is established on earth Daniel 2: 44 this is when Christ the Stone strikes the &amp;#39;image&amp;#39;, making this political image become like chaff upon the wind. This is also the time seen in Matthew 24: 29, 30 when Christ arrives &amp;#39;in power and great glory&amp;#39;, because the political system has been ejected from authority, at the time when Iran bombs Israel. Daniel 11; 44, 45 1Thessalonians 5: 2, 3. Repeated also in Matthew 25: 31, 34 we see the &amp;#39;sheep-like&amp;#39; true Christians are already inside God&amp;#39;s Kingdom when Christ appears. These are faithful ones John 3: 16. The Kingdom in Daniel 2: 44 becomes established earth-wide, when Divine actions bring the wicked to an end. Psalms 92: 7. This is the same Kingdom preached in Matthew 24: 14; and the Paradise Christ described in Luke 23: 43.&lt;br /&gt;The time has already appeared for an extinction level event; and the symptoms seen are &amp;#39;wrath of nations&amp;#39; Revelation 11: 18. This time of wrath reaches full maturity when Iran bombs Israel. Daniel 8: 20, 23-25. Daniel 11: 44, 45. This is the occasion when Jehovah will speak Ezekiel 38: 18, 19, and the authority of Christ Jesus displaces the authority of the political system. Zephaniah 2: 1-11. The &amp;#39;desolations&amp;#39; Matthew 24: 15 seen in Israel, mean this has already occurred.

These 'wrathful' events are also associated with the appearance of wars and wrath in Arab states Jeremiah 25: 24 and in Syria and Russia, as the 'kings of north near and far' Jeremiah 25: 24-26 strut their stuff in a war in Syria now involving Turkey.
