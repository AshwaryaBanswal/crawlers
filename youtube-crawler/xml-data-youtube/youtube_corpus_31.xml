            <video_title>Turkey-Syria: 'The heart of my family has died' - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>Turkey’s government has given Syrian refugees a deadline to move back to the areas they were registered in or risk deportation back to their war-torn home country.

About 3.7 million Syrian refugees now live in Turkey after fleeing the civil war.

The BBC has been told about refugees forced to leave their families behind, including Hisham whose three children have been left without a father.

They left 2 million muslims dead in Iraq for WMD which weren&amp;#39;t even there. That can be justified yes because it was USA and the pets (UK, EU etc.) who killed 2 million muslims.
