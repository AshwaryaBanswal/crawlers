Earthquakes can systematically trigger other ones on opposite side of Earth (antipodes)

antipode earthquakes on the opposite sides of the planet

Marker height off the globe represents depth into the Earth.

When an earthquake strikes, you will hear a rumble, ding, and a bell toll. The bell will toll the number of times = to the earthquake which occurs. (example : M4.0 will ring 4 times).

The most recent earthquake has a green placemark / flag on it.

Blue flag / placemark = the last earthquake which was looked up

               <original_script name="Roman">I also watch Mary Greeley  Yellowstone reports on Youtube and she&amp;#39;s been observing the EXACT SAME thing that Dutch has been complaining about.  USGS is doctering their live feeds, &amp;quot;dumbing&amp;quot; it down so that the live feed graphics and USELESS to anyone! She&amp;#39;s hopping mad as well as Dutch. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Mary reported yesterday morning that  &amp;#39;DRUMMING&amp;#39; was happening below Yellowstone.  Doesn&amp;#39;t sound real important to us, but in Seismology, &amp;#39;Drumming&amp;#39; is a sign of magma movement.  &amp;#39;Drumming&amp;#39; was recorded in the days BEFORE MT. ST. HELEN blew her top!   IT&amp;#39;S IMPORTANT for all of us to know, SO THAT WE CAN BE PREPARED!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;USGS must be staffed by men with tiny feet and tiny peckers, for them to be so THREATENED by one man, simply reporting the Truth. A lot of chest thumping and testosterone being sprayed about there!  get over it guys and let the rest of the World move on from your stupid GAMES!!</original_script>
