            <video_title>Syrians in Brazil: 'I am not a millionaire, but I will be' - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>Eyad and Joanna both left Syria to start a new life in Brazil.

They faced many challenges before setting up their businesses. Eyad is now a celebrity chef while Joanna works with other refugees to set up marketplaces and food events.

If their business plans work, the two young Syrians hope to become millionaires in a few years.

               <original_script name="Roman">Then you&amp;#39;ll love the coming &amp;quot;cultural enrichment&amp;quot; even more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=52m17s&quot;&gt;52:17&lt;/a&gt;7) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said, &amp;quot;The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. &amp;quot;O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=52m22s&quot;&gt;52:22&lt;/a&gt;0) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said... &amp;#39;I have been made victorious with terror&amp;#39;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=52m44s&quot;&gt;52:44&lt;/a&gt;) - A man came to Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle and said, &amp;quot;Instruct me as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward).&amp;quot; He replied, &amp;quot;I do not find such a deed.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m33s&quot;&gt;1:33&lt;/a&gt;) - the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m38s&quot;&gt;8:38&lt;/a&gt;7) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said, &amp;quot;I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: &amp;#39;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&amp;#39;. And if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not interfere with them except legally.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m30s&quot;&gt;1:30&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;The Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allah.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (52:73) - &amp;quot;Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said, &amp;#39;Know that Paradise is under the shades of swords&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (11:626) - [Muhammad said:] &amp;quot;I decided to order a man to lead the prayer and then take a flame to burn all those, who had not left their houses for the prayer, burning them alive inside their homes.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m14s&quot;&gt;1:14&lt;/a&gt;9) - &amp;quot;Abu Dharr reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, which of the deeds is the best? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=19m42s&quot;&gt;19:42&lt;/a&gt;94) - &amp;quot;Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war... When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah&amp;#39;s help and fight them.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sunan an-Nasa&amp;#39;i (Sahih) &amp;quot;Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=2m24s&quot;&gt;2:24&lt;/a&gt;4) - &amp;quot;Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=2m21s&quot;&gt;2:21&lt;/a&gt;6) - &amp;quot;Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=3m56s&quot;&gt;3:56&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:74) - &amp;quot;Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:76) - &amp;quot;Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah…&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:89) - &amp;quot;They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:95) - &amp;quot;Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=5m33s&quot;&gt;5:33&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m12s&quot;&gt;8:12&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;(Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels... &amp;quot;I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m15s&quot;&gt;8:15&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey&amp;#39;s end.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m39s&quot;&gt;8:39&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion is all for Allah&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m57s&quot;&gt;8:57&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (8:67) - &amp;quot;It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made a great slaughter in the land...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (8:65) - &amp;quot;O Prophet, exhort the believers to fight...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (9:5) - &amp;quot;So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m20s&quot;&gt;9:20&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah&amp;#39;s way are of much greater worth in Allah&amp;#39;s sight.

Sahih Bukhari (52:177) - Allah's Apostle said, &quot;The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. &quot;O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.&quot;
Sahih Bukhari (52:220) - Allah's Apostle said... 'I have been made victorious with terror'
Sahih Bukhari (52:44) - A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, &quot;Instruct me as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward).&quot; He replied, &quot;I do not find such a deed.&quot;
Sahih Muslim (1:33) - the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah
Sahih Bukhari (8:387) - Allah's Apostle said, &quot;I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah'. And if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not interfere with them except legally.&quot;
Sahih Muslim (1:30) - &quot;The Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allah.&quot;
Sahih Bukhari (52:73) - &quot;Allah's Apostle said, 'Know that Paradise is under the shades of swords'.&quot;
Sahih Bukhari (11:626) - [Muhammad said:] &quot;I decided to order a man to lead the prayer and then take a flame to burn all those, who had not left their houses for the prayer, burning them alive inside their homes.&quot;

Sahih Muslim (19:4294) - &quot;Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war... When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them.&quot;
Sunan an-Nasa'i (Sahih) &quot;Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy&quot;

Quran (2:244) - &quot;Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.&quot;

Quran (2:216) - &quot;Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.&quot;

Quran (4:76) - &quot;Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah…&quot;
Quran (4:89) - &quot;They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.&quot;
Quran (4:95) - &quot;Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives.

Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward&quot;
Quran (5:33) - &quot;The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement&quot;
Quran (8:12) - &quot;(Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels... &quot;I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them&quot;

Quran (8:39) - &quot;And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion is all for Allah&quot;
Quran (8:57) - &quot;If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.&quot;
Quran (8:67) - &quot;It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made a great slaughter in the land...&quot;
Quran (8:65) - &quot;O Prophet, exhort the believers to fight...&quot;
Quran (9:5) - &quot;So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.&quot;
Quran (9:20) - &quot;Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah's way are of much greater worth in Allah's sight. These are they who are triumphant.&quot;
Quran (9:29) - &quot;Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya (mafia protection tax) with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.&quot;
Quran (9:38-39) - &quot;O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth?

&lt;br /&gt;Quran (8:67) - &amp;quot;It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made a great slaughter in the land...&amp;quot;

&lt;br /&gt;Quran (9:5) - &amp;quot;So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m20s&quot;&gt;9:20&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah&amp;#39;s way are of much greater worth in Allah&amp;#39;s sight.

&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m29s&quot;&gt;9:29&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya (mafia protection tax) with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.&amp;quot;

Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (9:73) - &amp;quot;O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.&amp;quot;

            <comment_content_initial>You say that now, but wait a few years until they start bombing Brasilians like they're bombing everyone else because they are commanded by their false prophet to wage war until the entire world submits to islam.

Sahih Bukhari (52:177) - Allah's Apostle said, &quot;The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. &quot;O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.&quot;
Sahih Bukhari (52:220) - Allah's Apostle said... 'I have been made victorious with terror'
Sahih Bukhari (52:44) - A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, &quot;Instruct me as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward).&quot; He replied, &quot;I do not find such a deed.&quot;
Sahih Muslim (1:33) - the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah
Sahih Bukhari (8:387) - Allah's Apostle said, &quot;I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah'. And if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not interfere with them except legally.&quot;
Sahih Muslim (1:30) - &quot;The Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allah.&quot;
Sahih Bukhari (52:73) - &quot;Allah's Apostle said, 'Know that Paradise is under the shades of swords'.&quot;
Sahih Bukhari (11:626) - [Muhammad said:] &quot;I decided to order a man to lead the prayer and then take a flame to burn all those, who had not left their houses for the prayer, burning them alive inside their homes.&quot;
Sahih Muslim (1:149) - &quot;Abu Dharr reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, which of the deeds is the best? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause...&quot;
Sahih Muslim (19:4294) - &quot;Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war... When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them.&quot;
Sunan an-Nasa'i (Sahih) &quot;Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy&quot;



Quran (2:244) - &quot;Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.&quot;
Quran (2:216) - &quot;Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.&quot;
Quran (3:56) - &quot;As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.&quot;
Quran (4:74) - &quot;Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.&quot;
Quran (4:76) - &quot;Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah…&quot;
Quran (4:89) - &quot;They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.&quot;
Quran (4:95) - &quot;Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward&quot;
Quran (5:33) - &quot;The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement&quot;
Quran (8:12) - &quot;(Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels... &quot;I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them&quot;
Quran (8:15) - &quot;O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end.&quot;
Quran (8:39) - &quot;And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion is all for Allah&quot;
Quran (8:57) - &quot;If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.&quot;
Quran (8:67) - &quot;It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made a great slaughter in the land...&quot;
Quran (8:65) - &quot;O Prophet, exhort the believers to fight...&quot;
Quran (9:5) - &quot;So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.&quot;
Quran (9:20) - &quot;Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah's way are of much greater worth in Allah's sight. These are they who are triumphant.&quot;
Quran (9:29) - &quot;Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya (mafia protection tax) with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.&quot;
Quran (9:38-39) - &quot;O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place.&quot;
Quran (9:73) - &quot;O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.&quot;
Quran (9:123) - &quot;O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness.&quot;</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">If you don&amp;#39;t want people who commit crimes, then you would be wise to ban islam entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=52m17s&quot;&gt;52:17&lt;/a&gt;7) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said, &amp;quot;The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. &amp;quot;O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=52m22s&quot;&gt;52:22&lt;/a&gt;0) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said... &amp;#39;I have been made victorious with terror&amp;#39;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=52m44s&quot;&gt;52:44&lt;/a&gt;) - A man came to Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle and said, &amp;quot;Instruct me as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward).&amp;quot; He replied, &amp;quot;I do not find such a deed.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m33s&quot;&gt;1:33&lt;/a&gt;) - the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m38s&quot;&gt;8:38&lt;/a&gt;7) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said, &amp;quot;I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: &amp;#39;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&amp;#39;. And if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not interfere with them except legally.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m30s&quot;&gt;1:30&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;The Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allah.&amp;quot;

&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (11:626) - [Muhammad said:] &amp;quot;I decided to order a man to lead the prayer and then take a flame to burn all those, who had not left their houses for the prayer, burning them alive inside their homes.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m14s&quot;&gt;1:14&lt;/a&gt;9) - &amp;quot;Abu Dharr reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, which of the deeds is the best? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=19m42s&quot;&gt;19:42&lt;/a&gt;94) - &amp;quot;Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war... When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah&amp;#39;s help and fight them.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sunan an-Nasa&amp;#39;i (Sahih) &amp;quot;Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=2m24s&quot;&gt;2:24&lt;/a&gt;4) - &amp;quot;Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.&amp;quot;

But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=3m56s&quot;&gt;3:56&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:74) - &amp;quot;Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:76) - &amp;quot;Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah…&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:89) - &amp;quot;They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:95) - &amp;quot;Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=5m33s&quot;&gt;5:33&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m12s&quot;&gt;8:12&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;(Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels... &amp;quot;I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m15s&quot;&gt;8:15&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey&amp;#39;s end.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m39s&quot;&gt;8:39&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion is all for Allah&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m57s&quot;&gt;8:57&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (8:67) - &amp;quot;It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made a great slaughter in the land...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (8:65) - &amp;quot;O Prophet, exhort the believers to fight...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (9:5) - &amp;quot;So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m20s&quot;&gt;9:20&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah&amp;#39;s way are of much greater worth in Allah&amp;#39;s sight. These are they who are triumphant.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m29s&quot;&gt;9:29&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya (mafia protection tax) with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m38s&quot;&gt;9:38&lt;/a&gt;-39) - &amp;quot;O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (9:73) - &amp;quot;O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m12s&quot;&gt;9:12&lt;/a&gt;3) - &amp;quot;O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness.&amp;quot;</original_script>

            <comment_content_initial>Their &quot;culture&quot;, not so much.  Their food isn't even theirs, but was &quot;culturally appropriated&quot; from the millions of people they've raped, enslaved &amp; murdered over the centuries of non-stop conflict.
Say goodbye to the abundance of your rainforests as they bring in goats to devastate everything around them &amp; turn lush paradises into barren deserts from foolish animal mismanagement &amp; lack of agricultural history &amp; awareness.
There's a reason most islamic nations are barren deserts &amp; it's not from lack of opportunities or wealth.
They are a cult of usurpers that move in, claim to be merely peaceful victims while plotting the overthrow &amp; enslavement of your government &amp; people, because that's what they've done throughout their 1400 year history.

Behold, your future:
Sahih Bukhari (52:177) - Allah's Apostle said, &quot;The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. &quot;O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.&quot;

               <original_script name="Roman">Just wait a few years &amp;amp; you&amp;#39;ll be singing a different tune because this is what their cult commands them to do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=52m17s&quot;&gt;52:17&lt;/a&gt;7) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said, &amp;quot;The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. &amp;quot;O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=52m22s&quot;&gt;52:22&lt;/a&gt;0) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said... &amp;#39;I have been made victorious with terror&amp;#39;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=52m44s&quot;&gt;52:44&lt;/a&gt;) - A man came to Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle and said, &amp;quot;Instruct me as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward).&amp;quot; He replied, &amp;quot;I do not find such a deed.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m33s&quot;&gt;1:33&lt;/a&gt;) - the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m38s&quot;&gt;8:38&lt;/a&gt;7) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said, &amp;quot;I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: &amp;#39;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&amp;#39;. And if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not interfere with them except legally.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m30s&quot;&gt;1:30&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;The Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allah.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (52:73) - &amp;quot;Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said, &amp;#39;Know that Paradise is under the shades of swords&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (11:626) - [Muhammad said:] &amp;quot;I decided to order a man to lead the prayer and then take a flame to burn all those, who had not left their houses for the prayer, burning them alive inside their homes.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m14s&quot;&gt;1:14&lt;/a&gt;9) - &amp;quot;Abu Dharr reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, which of the deeds is the best? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=19m42s&quot;&gt;19:42&lt;/a&gt;94) - &amp;quot;Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war... When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah&amp;#39;s help and fight them.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sunan an-Nasa&amp;#39;i (Sahih) &amp;quot;Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=2m24s&quot;&gt;2:24&lt;/a&gt;4) - &amp;quot;Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=2m21s&quot;&gt;2:21&lt;/a&gt;6) - &amp;quot;Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=3m56s&quot;&gt;3:56&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:74) - &amp;quot;Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:76) - &amp;quot;Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah…&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:89) - &amp;quot;They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:95) - &amp;quot;Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=5m33s&quot;&gt;5:33&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m12s&quot;&gt;8:12&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;(Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels... &amp;quot;I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m15s&quot;&gt;8:15&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey&amp;#39;s end.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m39s&quot;&gt;8:39&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion is all for Allah&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m57s&quot;&gt;8:57&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (8:67) - &amp;quot;It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made a great slaughter in the land...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (8:65) - &amp;quot;O Prophet, exhort the believers to fight...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (9:5) - &amp;quot;So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m20s&quot;&gt;9:20&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah&amp;#39;s way are of much greater worth in Allah&amp;#39;s sight. These are they who are triumphant.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m29s&quot;&gt;9:29&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya (mafia protection tax) with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m38s&quot;&gt;9:38&lt;/a&gt;-39) - &amp;quot;O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (9:73) - &amp;quot;O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m12s&quot;&gt;9:12&lt;/a&gt;3) - &amp;quot;O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness.&amp;quot;</original_script>

            <comment_content_initial>Just wait a few years &amp; you'll be singing a different tune because this is what their cult commands them to do:

Sahih Bukhari (52:177) - Allah's Apostle said, &quot;The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. &quot;O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.&quot;
Sahih Bukhari (52:220) - Allah's Apostle said... 'I have been made victorious with terror'
Sahih Bukhari (52:44) - A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, &quot;Instruct me as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward).&quot; He replied, &quot;I do not find such a deed.&quot;
Sahih Muslim (1:33) - the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah
Sahih Bukhari (8:387) - Allah's Apostle said, &quot;I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah'. And if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not interfere with them except legally.&quot;
Sahih Muslim (1:30) - &quot;The Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allah.&quot;
Sahih Bukhari (52:73) - &quot;Allah's Apostle said, 'Know that Paradise is under the shades of swords'.&quot;
Sahih Bukhari (11:626) - [Muhammad said:] &quot;I decided to order a man to lead the prayer and then take a flame to burn all those, who had not left their houses for the prayer, burning them alive inside their homes.&quot;
Sahih Muslim (1:149) - &quot;Abu Dharr reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, which of the deeds is the best? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause...&quot;
Sahih Muslim (19:4294) - &quot;Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war... When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them.&quot;
Sunan an-Nasa'i (Sahih) &quot;Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy&quot;



Quran (2:244) - &quot;Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.&quot;
Quran (2:216) - &quot;Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.&quot;
Quran (3:56) - &quot;As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.&quot;

Quran (9:38-39) - &quot;O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth?

There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=52m22s&quot;&gt;52:22&lt;/a&gt;0) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said... &amp;#39;I have been made victorious with terror&amp;#39;

&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m33s&quot;&gt;1:33&lt;/a&gt;) - the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m38s&quot;&gt;8:38&lt;/a&gt;7) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said, &amp;quot;I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: &amp;#39;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&amp;#39;. And if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not interfere with them except legally.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m30s&quot;&gt;1:30&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;The Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allah.&amp;quot;

Make a holy war... When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah&amp;#39;s help and fight them.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sunan an-Nasa&amp;#39;i (Sahih) &amp;quot;Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=2m24s&quot;&gt;2:24&lt;/a&gt;4) - &amp;quot;Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.&amp;quot;

But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=3m56s&quot;&gt;3:56&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:74) - &amp;quot;Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:76) - &amp;quot;Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah…&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:89) - &amp;quot;They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:95) - &amp;quot;Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=5m33s&quot;&gt;5:33&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m12s&quot;&gt;8:12&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;(Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels... &amp;quot;I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m15s&quot;&gt;8:15&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey&amp;#39;s end.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m39s&quot;&gt;8:39&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion is all for Allah&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m57s&quot;&gt;8:57&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (8:67) - &amp;quot;It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made a great slaughter in the land...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (8:65) - &amp;quot;O Prophet, exhort the believers to fight...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (9:5) - &amp;quot;So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m20s&quot;&gt;9:20&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah&amp;#39;s way are of much greater worth in Allah&amp;#39;s sight. These are they who are triumphant.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m29s&quot;&gt;9:29&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya (mafia protection tax) with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m38s&quot;&gt;9:38&lt;/a&gt;-39) - &amp;quot;O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (9:73) - &amp;quot;O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m12s&quot;&gt;9:12&lt;/a&gt;3) - &amp;quot;O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness.&amp;quot;</original_script>

Quran (8:65) - &quot;O Prophet, exhort the believers to fight...&quot;
Quran (9:5) - &quot;So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.&quot;
Quran (9:20) - &quot;Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah's way are of much greater worth in Allah's sight. These are they who are triumphant.&quot;
Quran (9:29) - &quot;Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya (mafia protection tax) with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.&quot;
Quran (9:38-39) - &quot;O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place.&quot;
Quran (9:73) - &quot;O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.&quot;
Quran (9:123) - &quot;O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness.&quot;</comment_content_initial>

Things would have been so much better if they recognized Israel early,get back their side of the Golan before religious extremists taken power in Israel two decades later.

Moshe Dayan,Itzhak Rabin were very reasonable intellectuals and their religious side was sleeping at home with their family.

Now things became horrible when Netenyahu took power and only Syria is begging for peace. Arabs should understand that loosing wars have consequences, Wich is lost of lands, starvations, rape, massacres.

Russia and America are made of conquest,same for many empires. It's your fault, not the Jews fault, they were just more modern and smarter.

This said I don't agree that Syria people destroyed their country,it was destroyed by foreign agents. Its difficult to pinpoint who sent ISIS to destroy Syria but they are definitely fake, it's fake jihadism .

Now some said that a good chunk of isis is made of mossad agents and the rest are brainwashed idiots recruited online with females who serve as war hore.

I don't agree with that but many points their fingers at Israel.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">No, it isn&amp;#39;t.  Syria has been turned into a wasteland by their own idiotic muslim population &amp;amp; other countries fighting proxy wars using their useful stupidity &amp;amp; love for violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get ready for some cultural enrichment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=52m17s&quot;&gt;52:17&lt;/a&gt;7) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said, &amp;quot;The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. &amp;quot;O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=52m22s&quot;&gt;52:22&lt;/a&gt;0) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said... &amp;#39;I have been made victorious with terror&amp;#39;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=52m44s&quot;&gt;52:44&lt;/a&gt;) - A man came to Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle and said, &amp;quot;Instruct me as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward).&amp;quot; He replied, &amp;quot;I do not find such a deed.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m33s&quot;&gt;1:33&lt;/a&gt;) - the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m38s&quot;&gt;8:38&lt;/a&gt;7) - Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said, &amp;quot;I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: &amp;#39;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&amp;#39;. And if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not interfere with them except legally.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m30s&quot;&gt;1:30&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;The Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allah.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (52:73) - &amp;quot;Allah&amp;#39;s Apostle said, &amp;#39;Know that Paradise is under the shades of swords&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Bukhari (11:626) - [Muhammad said:] &amp;quot;I decided to order a man to lead the prayer and then take a flame to burn all those, who had not left their houses for the prayer, burning them alive inside their homes.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=1m14s&quot;&gt;1:14&lt;/a&gt;9) - &amp;quot;Abu Dharr reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, which of the deeds is the best? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sahih Muslim (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=19m42s&quot;&gt;19:42&lt;/a&gt;94) - &amp;quot;Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war... When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah&amp;#39;s help and fight them.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Sunan an-Nasa&amp;#39;i (Sahih) &amp;quot;Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=2m24s&quot;&gt;2:24&lt;/a&gt;4) - &amp;quot;Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=2m21s&quot;&gt;2:21&lt;/a&gt;6) - &amp;quot;Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=3m56s&quot;&gt;3:56&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:74) - &amp;quot;Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:76) - &amp;quot;Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah…&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:89) - &amp;quot;They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (4:95) - &amp;quot;Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=5m33s&quot;&gt;5:33&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m12s&quot;&gt;8:12&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;(Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels... &amp;quot;I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m15s&quot;&gt;8:15&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey&amp;#39;s end.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m39s&quot;&gt;8:39&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion is all for Allah&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=8m57s&quot;&gt;8:57&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (8:67) - &amp;quot;It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made a great slaughter in the land...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (8:65) - &amp;quot;O Prophet, exhort the believers to fight...&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (9:5) - &amp;quot;So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m20s&quot;&gt;9:20&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah&amp;#39;s way are of much greater worth in Allah&amp;#39;s sight. These are they who are triumphant.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m29s&quot;&gt;9:29&lt;/a&gt;) - &amp;quot;Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya (mafia protection tax) with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m38s&quot;&gt;9:38&lt;/a&gt;-39) - &amp;quot;O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (9:73) - &amp;quot;O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;Quran (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;amp;t=9m12s&quot;&gt;9:12&lt;/a&gt;3) - &amp;quot;O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness.&amp;quot;</original_script>

            <comment_content_initial>No, it isn't.  Syria has been turned into a wasteland by their own idiotic muslim population &amp; other countries fighting proxy wars using their useful stupidity &amp; love for violence.

Get ready for some cultural enrichment!

Sahih Bukhari (52:177) - Allah's Apostle said, &quot;The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. &quot;O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.&quot;
Sahih Bukhari (52:220) - Allah's Apostle said... 'I have been made victorious with terror'
Sahih Bukhari (52:44) - A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, &quot;Instruct me as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward).&quot; He replied, &quot;I do not find such a deed.&quot;
Sahih Muslim (1:33) - the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah
Sahih Bukhari (8:387) - Allah's Apostle said, &quot;I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah'. And if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not interfere with them except legally.&quot;
Sahih Muslim (1:30) - &quot;The Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allah.&quot;
Sahih Bukhari (52:73) - &quot;Allah's Apostle said, 'Know that Paradise is under the shades of swords'.&quot;
Sahih Bukhari (11:626) - [Muhammad said:] &quot;I decided to order a man to lead the prayer and then take a flame to burn all those, who had not left their houses for the prayer, burning them alive inside their homes.&quot;
Sahih Muslim (1:149) - &quot;Abu Dharr reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, which of the deeds is the best? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause...&quot;
Sahih Muslim (19:4294) - &quot;Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war... When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them.&quot;
Sunan an-Nasa'i (Sahih) &quot;Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy&quot;



Quran (2:244) - &quot;Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.&quot;
Quran (2:216) - &quot;Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.&quot;
Quran (3:56) - &quot;As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.&quot;
Quran (4:74) - &quot;Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.&quot;
Quran (4:76) - &quot;Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah…&quot;
Quran (4:89) - &quot;They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.&quot;
Quran (4:95) - &quot;Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame, etc.), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward&quot;
Quran (5:33) - &quot;The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement&quot;
Quran (8:12) - &quot;(Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels... &quot;I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them&quot;

               <original_script name="Roman">@F-22 Raptor I will explain to you that hardly a non-Brazilian will understand this, I believe that more than 80% of violence in northern Brazil has caused drug trafficking, criminal factions created in southeastern prisons dominate the dispute for drug trafficking in the north and in Brazil all. We can say that this war is new in northern Brazil, but the southeast specifically São Paulo was once as violent as in the north the reality is that one of these factions dominates the entire state of São Paulo so crime is low there is no war that happens in the north. And fuck all your skin color theory.</original_script>

I&amp;#39;ve been working for this provider online for 24 months now and I never been happier...
