               <original_script name="Roman">READ AND BE TRULY ENLIGHTENED: Starseed/Indigo child: They are hybrids. Forbidden fruit; hence fruit of the womb, and you will know them by their fruit, therefore their offspring; their beliefs, attitudes, actions, and behaviors. Iron (of angels) does not mix with miry clay (humans)! It causes corruption in the body/flesh; DNA/genes; hence, generation of vipers. Your body is your temple; hence a corrupted body/temple/house; therefore, your house has been left unto you desolate. DESOLATE: deprived or destitute of inhabitants; deserted; uninhabited; solitary; lonely: a desolate place; therefore having not the Holy Spirit of Almighty God, to lead, guide, and direct them in the way that they should go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence, Matthew 23 : 33 (KJV) Ye {serpents}, ye {generation (of) vipers}: [offspring; bloodline, hence life is in the blood, the blood of Christ Jesus, royal bloodline, and true/rightful heir and King of the Kingdom of God] how can ye escape the {damnation} of hell? What Paul in the scriptures referred to as corrupted flesh! Therefore, {born this way}; and {innately} inclined to go after strange flesh/reprobate minds! This corruptible must put on incorruptible!
