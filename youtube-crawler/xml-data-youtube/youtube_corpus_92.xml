Earthquakes can systematically trigger other ones on opposite side of Earth (antipodes)

antipode earthquakes on the opposite sides of the planet

Professionals now adopting &quot;GLOBAL EARTHQUAKE FORECASTING MODELS&quot; which have been proved correct:

Marker height off the globe represents depth into the Earth.

When an earthquake strikes, you will hear a rumble, ding, and a bell toll. The bell will toll the number of times = to the earthquake which occurs. (example : M4.0 will ring 4 times).

The most recent earthquake has a green placemark / flag on it.

Blue flag / placemark = the last earthquake which was looked up

               <original_script name="Roman">When I was young my parents and a bunch of relatives had cabins out in Twenty Nine Palms there is a lake way out there off Amboy Road also an abandon silver mine. We used to go out there all the time About 40 years ago. I think they thought someday it would get populated. It never did Anyway, we would go scouting around with my older brother there are pumas rocks all over. Small ones but they are there. There is a Marine Base out there also. There is also a lot of red rocks with gray in the center. They are very smooth. When I say a lot I mean it looks like you are on another planet.</original_script>
