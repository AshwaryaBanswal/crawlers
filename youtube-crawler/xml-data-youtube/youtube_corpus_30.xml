               <original_script name="Roman">It&amp;#39;s not like that everywhere. I live in an Arabic country and I have a domestic worker, but I treat her with love. she has a day off.. she has her own room and bathroom.. she sleeps as early as she wants.. she has her passport and ID ..and she can leave whenever she wants. My kids are all grown up now.. I don&amp;#39;t need much help around the house, but she doesn&amp;#39;t want to leave because she can&amp;#39;t get a job in her country that can provide for her family.. so we agreed she can stay for as long as she needs to. &lt;br /&gt;she tells me horrible stories about her friends in other houses and it really breaks my heart.&lt;br /&gt;but you have to know.. some of us are still human. both me and her are strangers in this country and we help each other out</original_script>
