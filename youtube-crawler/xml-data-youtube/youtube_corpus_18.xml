Some areas have gone without substantial rainfall for up to five years.

The BBC's Africa correspondent Andrew Harding visited one small town which lies at the heart of the crisis.

There are 4 factors of possible paths to prolonging a reasonable weather globally, think baseball hail, flooding, landslides, tornados, wildfires and big storms.

The first flips towns off-grid, its magnet motor for 1300hp/1-Mw is small, fits --&gt; cars, trucks, tractors, trains, aeroplanes and ships at sea.

This implies cars without refueling or recharging for the LIFETIME of the owner, eh?

The 1300hp/1-Mw has a half-century warranty of 24/7 power with normal upkeep, the magnets are still 90% in 1000-years, it's the only sensible power source to pursue.

So, flip towns off-grid, 1-Mw/1300hp, "50-year no-inputs warranty"; 17yr R&amp;D; Belgian: technokontrol.com/en/current-projects/generator.php, the RF-5000, sparkless for use with explosives, military-spec.

For home farm ranch made to wire into panels, act as the inverter: 10kw&#8226;$15k, 5kw&#8226;$8k, 20-year wrnty,1-cent/kwh; S. Korean: infinitysav.com/magneticgenerator

The 5kw fits a pickup toolbox, is quiet, no fumes indoors, looks good for construction to me, $35/month + interest for 24x7 power, eh?

These globally are the ONLY machines ready for assembly-line, high-volume design and production I found in trade studies, you try.

They are a bleeding edge, beaten path to a near zero-emission, tiny carbon-footprint motive power for all machines.

SECOND, is using algae to purify wastewater at the treatment plant, or onsite for home&#8226;farm&#8226;ranch using the same units, this emits O2 and removes CO2, eh?

Then, the oils &amp; biomass can become biodiesel and derivatives, from a pilot study I did for Phoenix, AZ, a 10M-gallon/day plant can produce about 3M-gallon/day of biodiesel, Gov. Jan Brewer and he0r EPA head were on board, we got shot down by her party.

Too bad, eh? Sound familiar?

THIRD: Have ALL IC-Engine mfg's make replacements with N.Tesla Tailpipes, a one-way air valve with no moving parts that ZEROES emissions for their tailpipes.

If they won't, shut them down, this eliminates soot from biodiesel, can be scaled up to industrial smokestacks, it reduces back-pressure, improves performance.

And, he tied it to IC-Engines for this purpose 80yrs ago, eh?

FOURTH: It all boils down to dealing with Arctic seaice, HEAT GAINED in the 2007 retreat was 95,000-Twh over average.

Closing all Steam-age power plants 250Mwh and above is a one-time save of 36,000-Twh in emitted wasteheat.

That's 2&#8226;1/2-times too little to balance the gain vs the loss compared to the 1980-2000 average ice extent.

Losing the seaice is game-over on controlling runaway in the Arctic, this is what brings the extremes in weather vs assuming it'd get tropical to midwest farmers, eh?

Also, the Arctic Ocean is at the aragonite saturation point, all that a local marine biologist saw flying over the newly opened water were jellyfish, millions of them.

There is no fishery there as it becomes open water.

The serious 'Last Hurrah' for it all, to me, for what humanity needs to do: 

Install a weir dam at St. Lawrence Is. and polder north the entire Chukchi Sea to prevent wave damage and stratify the water to refreeze the bottom creating a year-round seaice refuge.

ALL shipping confined within 3-4km of shore, zero cross-ocean traffic, this uses Dutch ships, materials and methods to create polders, shoals &amp; levees. 

And, building submerged "atolls" encircling&#160; methane vents, this uses the bubble flow to pull in colder bottom water which refreezes them.

It all confines the freshwater runoff and most of all limits early melting from shore out to-sea in spring.

This reduces 5-Amazons of warmer, fresher water to 1/100th of what is melting the seaice from below.

Fresher water freezes at a higher temperature so true seaice isn't formed at the surface on freezeup, it needs -2C/28.4F for seaice to last over ONE season.

This intends to prevent the Siberian jetstream from turning north and can be modelled, the N.Pacific is too warm and heats the airmass from below, with The Blob in the Gulf of AK, that drives the circulation pattern needing change back to Holocene patterns.

So, the warmth sends rain to Anchorage in December and frozen oranges to Florida the routine now, started early, eh?

As that air cools it now gets to low latitudes ONLY over land to balance equatorial overheating.

The concept has 36,000 views on a seaice forum and zero actions upon it.

It's the only geographic location on Earth with the ability to alter the Anthropocene jetstream paths back into N.America instead of going north.

I can't order it done, the people in the poop deck party think everything's fine with lifeboats already in the water ...

In any case, it's the ONLY sane try to alter things not dependent upon emissions to overcome those effects enough to give MIDWEST FARMERS a break, else, expect a repeat of this past year or worse, eh? 

Expect flooding after this early snow, cold ground for maximum runoff vs a normal Holocene year, or worse, it stays cold.

Welcome to the Anthropocene, CO2 won't go below 400ppm for &gt;&gt;120,000-years as oceans outgas their aragonite losses by reversing the carbonic acid cycle which acidifies fast and goes alkaline very, very slowly , climate hysteresis, a real reason to consider extinction with business-as-usual.

"The rate of acidification is 10-times faster or more than anything we have seen for the past 50-million years and perhaps over the last 300-million years.".&#160; ICES ASC 2013 Plenary Lecture;
