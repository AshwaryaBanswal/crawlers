Comment19	Turkey promotes terrorism and where is human rights organisations right now Propoganda channel BBC
Comment20	the world remembers when the socialists fanatics led by Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer were saying Trump and former national security adviser John Bolton will start WW3, and now &quot; suddenly &quot; the Democrats are the ones opposing the withdrawal of US troops from Syria. the Democrats are the TRUE war whisperers !
Comment21	Biased media from BBC as always, ypd/pkk is considered a terrorist organisation by more than just Turkey and calling them Kurdish forces as if they represent Kurds is unfair as there are many Kurds who don&#39;t align themselves with such terror organisations.
Comment22	Bro just throw a nuke at turkey that would shut their annoying ass up. They&#39;re pussies... just show them why ur the king of the world
Comment23	We are led by nancy boys with soft hands who grew up in extreme privilege, have never experienced hardship, and never served their country a day in their pampered lives. And a certain segment of the population somehow thought such people would make excellent leaders? Stupid gets what stupid deserves.

Comment41	Pence is just a silent Trump Type. He should be impeached along with Trump both are humin waste.
Comment42	Someone please assassinate erdo boy.
Comment43	And how does that work, by asking nicely? (sarcasm) If US wants to end the conflict, drop an atom bomb at Istanbul, maybe it will put those wretches in their place.
Comment44	He can go and beg Erdogan now, he was threatning Turkey last year, now he goes there they see the danger of Turkey looking in the east! What I want to say is this USA was Allies with terorists so they can depopulate people of midle east and Israel can have her dream of holy land, usa takes ould and gold but that plan fails after 15 years and they see now at Venecuela for oil and Israel can sit there and eat shit only.
Comment45	Pence is utterly worthless. He&#39;s not going to do anything other than make sure he isn&#39;t left alone in a room with a woman.
Comment 45.1	@playlists No I mean people who don&#39;t look up anything about a topic and blatently refuse to unless someone gives them a &quot;source&quot; in witch they probably won&#39;t read it or only pay attention to the dumb parts of it and critise it if it goes agienst there belives.
Comment 45.2	@Demiclea what you mean people who like to know what they are talking about rather than just outsource their thinking to the loudest preacher / drunk / bully under the rock they live under
Comment 45.3	@playlists that&#39;s not a bad idea luckily I&#39;m not a &quot;I NEED SOURCES FROM OTHER PEOPLE OR I WONT BELIVE YOU AND I WONT LOOK IT UP UNLESS YOU DO.&quot; kind of guy those people are annoying as shit.

Comment46	Turkish makes its own weapons LMAO ✌
Comment47	We have a saying in the United States...”The only thing pulling out is Putin’s penis from Trump’s ass.”
Comment48	Trump couldn’t point out Turkey on a map. He doesn’t even know the lyrics of the American national anthem. He couldn’t name the amendments of the American constitution. I bet he is unable to tell the birthdays of his grandchildren (might even have trouble with the dates of his children and Eric).
Comment49	Mike pence wants Erdogon to stop fighting Daesh/ppk/ypg/sdf
Comment50	Long Live turkey 🇹🇷
Comment 50.1	Short short short live 🦃 turkey criminals...
Comment51	Donald Trump is doing a good of weakening America&#39;s international credibility and authority..
Comment 51.1	@Simon Matthews There is clearly a difference between how world leaders view America under Donald Trump vs previous Presidents.  The key difference being that Trump is not at all respected by our allies and is continuously mocked around the world. There is a reason why the UK has a giant blimp that makes Trump look like a baby in diapers. Obama on the other hand was highly respected by our European allies. It&#39;s a fallacy for you to imply that Americans damaging our image a long time ago somehow means that Donald Trump can&#39;t make it worse. So my point is that Trump is making our credibility and respectability significantly worse while previous Presidents have made improvements. And every country has a history of massacres at one point or another, this is not unique to only America.
Comment 51.2	I think Americans and America did that a long time ago when massacres were called collateral damage.
Comment52	100Billi TRADE DEAL GONE!! ..... ENERGY @RMS SANCTioNS GOOD!! START!! .... DOESNT BUY ME CHEAP TURKiSH POS THiS SUMMER BUT GOOD START!! ..... NOW EDDY TELL TRUMP TOO!! F@CK OFF!!

Comment53	Europe and USA paved way for Russians to win Middle East.<br />Trump on every international level fulfils Putin dreams..Best of Luck<br />Problem this time for BBC and some other westerm media is that they are unable to build a strong anti Turkey Narrative.

Comment61	Of course British bombs only hit bad people, seen in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan. The bombed weddings were sure just bad people in disguise. Irony off.
Comment62	bbc why you don&#39;t like showing vice president? get more trp showing trump?
Comment63	bbc why you don&#39;t like showing vice president? get more trp showing trump?

Comment75	This is nothing but trumps  hypocrisy,it smells anytime  he does something.
Comment76	America is mother of destruction
Comment77	The United States is not responsible for maintaining the balance of power, Britain, Germany, France are more than welcome to carry that responsibility
Comment 77.1	@Noman Has blinded me that would mean we should be involved in every conflict or injustice that takes place on the planet. Good try but we&#39;re not the world police nor should we be the ones trying to single handedly resolve conflicts between cultures, countries and history between their countries that we have no stake. in. It is arrogance to think a super power can just resolve these issues because they have the biggest guns.
Comment 77.2	Part of being a super power means preserving global order.
Comment78	Erdogan should ask him why does a Christian dhimmi support Bibi Netanyahu who calls Jesus a liar, marxist death cult that worships Abdullah Ocalan as a God, Modi who murders Christians for converting Hindus and finally MBS who bombs children.
Comment79	I think trump is too unresponsible

Comment 86.1	Only way Ameeican economy does well is through arms sales.
Comment87	You dont see the kids in palestin and kashmir  whom are killed by israel and india
Comment88	I don&#39;t understand Trump, sanction can not work. Why not you call Kurds? World war 2 has nothing to do with this. Sir Church Hill once said never give in.
Comment89	Turkey vs Marxist Kurdish Terrorist... why they don&#39;t want to understand?

Comment 96.4	true
Comment97	Who Didn&#39;t help him in WW2 and Normandy?<br />Kurds was under Turkey rule .Turks was Hitlers ally.
Comment 97.1	Fake news
Comment98	Turkey is fighting the YPG/PKK terrorists not the Kurds. There are 3 million plus kurds in Turkey alone. If there were animosity between them then there would have been big bloodshed in Turkey alone. <br />So get the facts right Turkey is fighting terrorists which were labeled so by international communitys, agencys etc.
Comment99	The Turkish people question why the United States, our NATO ally, would refrain from supporting our counter-terrorism efforts.They wonder why America offers no remedy to the refugee crisis.They try to understand why Washington opposes the creation of a safe haven for refugees
Comment100	"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23peacefountain"">#peacefountain</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bar%C4%B1%C5%9Fp%C4%B1nar%C4%B1"">#Barışpınarı</a><br />I hope peace will come to the region.The Turks are right."

Comment 101.3	@Orange Crush stupid people who have never travelled outside USA live in a bubble.<br /><br />Idiots

Comment108	Erdogan is doing well, <br />Around 4 millions of refugees are in Turkey, so he is settling  them in there own place, <br />The kurds are not giving the rights to other people so Turkey is fighting for them,
Comment 108.1	Tell that to the kurdish politician who got killed the other day, tell that to the civilians amongst women and children that got killed beacuse of this invasion. Turkey financed ISIS and let them cross the border of Syria multiple times, they are as much of a terrorist state as any. Do you know what Turkey is fighting for? Answer: an ethnic cleansing of kurds, something that you would never admit. You hate them for the same reason as everyone else in the middle east, they want their own state and that is your nightmare.
Comment109	Smart move by @Real Donald Trump <br />🤣😂
Comment110	LOL, all the EU can do is cry &quot;Trump!&quot;  500,000,000 EU citizens, ZERO soldiers.....

Comment 111.2	Gift Kalua Gibo are you joking? Do you know how we fought with Isis. We didn’t want to involve because it wasn’t our business but things changed negatively so we had to invervene. We have power to defeat Syria, SDF and ISIS in a lump dude.

Daesh were airlifted on CIA copters and dropped into Afghanistan.<br /><br />Another face of Daesh is Blackwater / Xe.<br /><br />Guess what Trump wants to do!!<br /><br />Outsource the Afghan war to Daesh ooops sorry meant Blackwater / Xe.
Comment120	Humanitarian disaster?! This disaster has already begun 8 years ago! Turkey doesn&#39;t need no permission from no one to protect himself from terrorists! Turkey had also warned the US about the arming of YPG terrorists the so called kurds cause that&#39;s the game westerns play now?! Calling them &quot;kurds&quot; won&#39;t do the job!!!
Comment 120.1	@Axe Even no
Comment 120.2	@Sad Orgasm get out of middle east fork you
Comment 120.3	Global Terrorist USA can’t see the atrocities committed on daily bases in Kashmir.. by the Terrorist Indian Govt of Modi...fuck the corrupted West &amp; UN

Comment121	Everything TRAITOR TRUMP does either benefits himself and or PUTIN
Comment 121.1	@Joseph Stalin You stupid idiot he allowed the war to start, encouraged it and lost the best allies we ever had
Comment 121.2	@Orange Crush The cure is that TRAITOR TRUMP HANGS and scum like you spit on and deported
Comment 121.3	Cry us a River.  TDS is really devastating.  No cure.
Comment 121.4	But if he declared war he&#39;d be criticised for not being peaceful. He  cant win
Comment122	Look at what Trump Co LLC got us into now! Now Turkey has 50 of our nukes held hostage. Jeezuz friggin Christ! This guy is a MONSTER!! PLEASE...Rest of the world...don&#39;t judge us by this horrible person. Most of us voted for somebody else. Don&#39;t forget that.
Comment 122.1	@DANNYBOY73 To make it easier for you, I already knew that, dingus. My comment had nothing to do with a fear of them actually using the nukes. Another thing that would make it easier for me would be you using proper punctuation. <br /><br />Way to avoid the meat of my original comment though...you&#39;re a pro at deflection, which, from what I&#39;ve seen and heard, is a coveted attribute amongst your peers.
Comment 122.2	@Jay Free Well to make it easier for you, turkey doesn&#39;t have the keys to the 50 nukes, they&#39;ll be safely stored in a usaaf base.
Comment 122.3	@DANNYBOY73 Is that a statement or a question? Also, what the heck are you implying? Exactly what argument are you trying to make here? Lol
Comment 122.4	You ever heard of a fully armed base.
Comment123	Hello Pence, do not go, it is a trap by trump. Back out now
Comment124	Good job turkey
Comment125	I&#39;m sure Mike Pence is the absolute best person ? to send there with his Bible!.? Yep this is going to solve everything?! Happy birthday Vladimir Putin ! you got what you wanted!. I&#39;m so happy our acting President Donald Trump could accommodate your every wish!. This crap stinks to high heaven!.
Comment 125.1	And!! Daesh were airlifted on CIA copters and dropped into Afghanistan.<br /><br />Another face of Daesh is Blackwater / Xe.<br /><br />Guess what Trump wants to do!!<br /><br />Outsource the Afghan war to Daesh ooops sorry meant Blackwater / Xe.
Comment126	Nothing more than fooling the world and it is apparent that these two parties are hand in gloves...taking turns there for meeting respective targets..this is classic example of what happens to a country whose infighting is not managed within country itself..they become battle ground for others and become too difficult to get back to normal life...
Comment127	it is OK lets give the Russians and Chinese a run they solve those problems.........we will see

Comment 130.1	Dumb fuck.
Comment 130.2	Except we&#39;re gonna be dealing with the repercussions soon. Take a look at the bigger picture, dingus
Comment131	Good job Turkey.  giving the refugees their right to return to Syria with dignity,  protecting national security and not occupying others land like that of US and EU. <br />And Turkey is not doing this Illegally. There is a agreement called &quot;Adana agreement&quot; Between Syria and Turkey which western media never mention. <br />I salute Erdogan.
Comment132	What a load of state of the art British Broadcasting Bull Shit.  Heavily biased propaganda.  The acknowledged terrorist group is just that and no not merely some collective of Kurds.<br /><br />Say it how it is and make a little mention of the massive loss of life in Turkey due to these terrorists.<br /><br />Bizarre how the UK has the audacity to put sanctions on Turkey and act holier than thou whilst supplying arms to a Saudi dictatorship to bomb thousands in Yemen.
Comment133	BS we started shit in 2017 and in 2018
Comment 133.1	Started what.
Comment134	Sounds like World War 3?  Trump just made America look weak and look bad. The whole world is watching!
Comment 134.1	@Jeffrey Romero The commercial media in America &amp; in your country are controlled by left-wing liberals and don&#39;t actually represent the whole of the country.  Whatever it is you&#39;re smoking, you should probably take a break.
Comment 134.2	Your right my comment  to trump  wont change anything.   Honestly, it doesn&#39;t matter. The American  people will raise above trump.  I dont know why i reply to radical trump supporters 🤦‍♂️.
Comment 134.3	Trump is really upset by your hurtful comment....Nope, he could give 2 shits what you think!
Comment135	Yep, Pence is going to teach the Turks how to make an Indiana style ghetto like Gary, or South Bend or Kokomo. It is nice to see all those tax free churches between the run down burned out crack houses. Gotta love the Ex Gov. His preying really helped the blight sprout more weeds.
Comment136	&quot;Bring troops back home&quot;? Saudi Arabia didn&#39;t help in Normandy, moron. Your sending troops to Iraq and Saudi Arabia. You turned our military into a militia. Get fuc@ed.
Comment137	Not going to change a damn think. Pence is a wet noodle.
Comment 137.1	@Simon Matthews Not seeing the UK take a Leadership role on this.  When in the last 100 years have they taken a Leadership role?   Let your government put a rifle in your hands &amp; send you into Syria.  That will make things &#39;better&#39;.  Simon says...👍
Comment 137.2	@Orange Crush USA ain&#39;t gonna change a damn thing but make things worse..<br /><br />Turkey is protecting its sovereignty  so well done Turkey!!
Comment 137.3	Your comment is not going to change a damn thing.
Comment138	BBC doesnt even talk about deaths of civilians in Turkeys side. Those so called western allies have been shelling randomly to the civil areas near the border. YPG killed 18 civilian one of them was a 9 months old baby. This is pure propaganda. classic western mainstream media
Comment 138.1	Turkey have to control extensive borderline with Syria in order to eliminate any threat coming from there. US and Russia must get out of there because they don&#39;t have any reasonable cause to being in Syria.
Comment 138.2	No one will injure your civilians if you just get your ass out from Syria

Comment 140.1	Yep ur preident works for em
Comment 140.2	@dicecop - Suck your daddy off you little spunk bubble.
Comment 140.3	Good. God bless mighty Russia ;D
Comment141	Turkey has had enough of Syrian refugees, now it&#39;s time to go home and Putin is not happy about it that&#39;s why Russia immediately claim the umaned American post, and Russia is now responsible of all terrorists that are captured by the kerds and American&#39;s, let&#39;s see what will happen.
Comment 141.1	Wally - Assad and Putin were the ones that actually created and funded Isis. Isis was created to fight against the FSA, and Assad&#39;s other enemies that were trying to overthrow him. Russia had 200 troops embedded with ISIS and Assad had several of his commanders also embedded with them and directing their attacks. Isis also used Assad&#39;s cell phone system and when US planes would bomb cell towers in Isis towns, Assad sent repairmen. I can see where Turkey is tired of having 3.9 million refugees in their country, but since these are Sunni refugees, when they return with weapons that Erdogan is giving them, then the civil war will start back up again. I think this is the main reason that Assad is sending troops to secure the border, and stop the refugees from coming back home, because he knows they are Sunni&#39;s that will be causing problems. I think deep down inside, Erdogan is still pissed that Assad is still in power after all the Sunni Al Nusra militants he was sending in to try and overthrow Assad.
Comment142	Corrupt people in the White House  { The Moscow Times }

Turkey attempts to create a safe zone for 3.6 millions Syrians to return back to their lands.. its a humanitarian crisis!!.....COME TOGETHER, ALL OF YOU!!!!!!
Comment149	If bbc so concerned about innocent children, why are they selling arms to barbaric Saudis that killing innocent children and women in Yamen. Hypocrites.
Comment150	Hang them.👈👀
Comment151	BBC Fake News 👎
Comment152	"Turkey&#39;s aim is to push the YPG/PKK terrorists away from its border to create a &quot;safe-zone&quot; on the Syrian side, where it could send back some of the 4 million refugees from Syria&#39;s eight-year civil war that it currently hosts. The EU still not delivered on its promise to provide aid for refugees in Turkey. <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BREAKING"">#BREAKING</a> Turkey not fighting Kurds, but YPG/PKK terror group, world must differentiate between the two."

Most powerful middle east countries like Iran , Turkey,  Syria all are Russian friends even weaker military countries like Arabia Saudi,  United Arabia Emirates also close friend of Russia even nearest countries Pakistan,  China also Russian friends.  Where is the America?  Middle east is now Russian hand . USA has nothing . Not single countries in middle east.
Comment 158.1	abul hasan - We want our middle east back. It&#39;s not fair that Russia has it. Dang that Putin, I am so pissed at him for doing this. Just kidding, the US needs to stay out of the middle east and mind our own business. Bush should be in prison right now for war crimes committed when he illegally invaded Iraq and stole Saddam&#39;s oil.
Comment159	Fake news
Comment160	So what, every time he is asked a question he responds he was unaware...He is only meeting with turkey because trump doesn&#39;t have the balls to now...Worthless...

Comment 166.3	Illuminati is going to kick your asses one day.. Bloody Americans..
Comment 166.4	@Toby Baxter Could be a troll but I doubt a troll would go through the trouble of writing in Arabic. The BBC comment section is always pretty toxic and many extremists leave comments here. He probably has the same ideology as the Saudis and ISIS.
Comment167	Stop these killings in Middle East, Yemeni and Kurds children are victims. UN and EU should move to stop Turkey and Saudi.
Comment168	Still too scared to say invasion 😂
Comment 168.1	@Axe Even I prefer to be spooned.

Comment169	BBC your &quot;reporting&quot; is garbage
Comment170	We American&#39;s had no power there.   We were a common enemy to the Countries in the region.
Comment171	Take note USA. Today is the day you lost your championship of the world belt to Russia.<br />Hey! You didn&#39;t want the job. You betrayed your Allies and tucked your tail. You can bring all your troops home now.<br />Win/Win. Everybody&#39;s a winner. Except for the Kurds who you abandoned.<br />But now that we know how the USA works, make sure you don&#39;t sabotage new world leader like arming ISIS. AGAIN!!!

Comment175	It is just as illusion wrap up with deep corruption for primitive Trump, Putin and Edrogan...
Comment176	Trump has so fucked this up. Turkey will tie Pence to a nuke and ask for a ransom. Watching Pence lie about something that was crystal clear a couple of days earlier makes you gag. The WH truly believes that everybody has the attention span of a gerbil. Unfortunately, people now have a tracker on him and know exactly what he&#39;s done.
Comment177	Such a betrayal from the US
Comment 177.1	@Yinz Burgh - <b>End</b> you say. That&#39;s what the purpose of the troops was for. Now Trump <b>started</b> a fresh conflict which has compromised thousands of ISIS fighters and supporters. Also. The troops were redeployed to Iraq ! You numpty!<br /><br />You Trumpsters only listen to Trump and Fox news ! Ffs.
Comment 177.2	Do your part and join pkk
Comment 177.3	@Peter Livingstone Right, I&#39;m a Trumptard because I want an end to these stupid conflicts that never benefit us. I don&#39;t care what purpose it was seving, we shouldn&#39;t have been in Syria to begin with.
Comment 177.4	@Yinz Burgh - you don&#39;t seem to grasp the importance those 1000 peace keeping troops held. But that&#39;s Trumptards for you folks.
Comment 177.5	fork you shittyhole
Comment178	I hope Mike stays there
Comment 178.1	@tele68 Rudy, Pompeo, Kelly, Barr, Jared
Comment 178.2	But who would carry Donald&#39;s water?
Comment179	Fuck Turkey.
Comment180	WW 3 incoming..
Comment 180.1	@yh a true.. I think it will slowly evolve into a bigger Worldwar
Comment 180.2	@yh a because all the states still involved are on the same side lol ;D
Comment 180.3	Why is this not already a ww3? there are so many states involved in this.
Comment181	You know when you hearing but not listening?  That&#39;s what all this sounds like.  Like, what&#39;s all that noise.  You don&#39;t even rely on some one just being an expert any more.  Maybe it&#39;s a good thing, fuck knows.
Comment182	More BBC Turkophobic racism. Zero balance, and zero mention of how the terrorists from this region have been bombing and executing civilians on the Turkish side for decades whilst being funded by the west.
Comment183	Who made America the world police? I never understood this...
Comment 183.1	Harry Haslam - Why do we, the US, keep getting involved in these wars and conflicts around the world? It&#39;s because we have a crooked military industrial complex running the show and bribing our politicians. When the uprisings in Libya started against Gadaffi, the lobbyists for the bomb makers were in Washington bribing our politicians to bomb Gadaffi&#39;s army and we totally decimated it with cruise missiles, hellfire missiles, etc. Each cruise missile costs 1.5 million dollars and our military dropped hundreds, maybe thousands of them on his military machinery and weapons stores. These companies make big money when we start dropping bombs. When the Syrian uprising started, a few days later the bomb makers were back in Washington once again and bribing Obama and our politicians to bomb Assad out of power. Obama was preparing to do it, but the American people protested and said no. We also called our elected reps and said no, and they backed off their plan to bomb Assad. Then when Isis came on the scene, they bribed Obama and other politicians to bomb Isis, and we spent billions of dollars doing this. These evil bomb makers and politicians that they bribe, don&#39;t care about the innocent people their bombs are killing in other countries. The greed and lust for money is what controls them. We have to do something to stop this military industrial complex. Our president Eisenhower warned us of this back in the 1950&#39;s and he was the one that coined the term &quot;military industrial complex&quot;. He could see what was on the horizon way back then.
Comment 183.2	They dominated the world stage after WW2, taking over much from Britain.
Comment 183.3	As an American, I couldn&#39;t agree more. Some people here are brainwashed. It doesn&#39;t help when Trump fucks up everything he touches.
Comment184	Betrayal!!!
Comment185	Keep going Turkey, respect from all of us here

Comment 186.5	@Big Bill O&#39;Reilly unwarranted abuses and insults if you have a point then state it .
Comment187	Trump&#39;s successor is going to have a nightmare to deal with.
Comment 187.1	"@Daniel Ryan For one the situation in Syria was undeniably in a much worse situation when Trump took over from Obama. That is a fact 👍<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/JFpanWNgfQY"">https://youtu.be/JFpanWNgfQY</a>"
Comment 187.2	@T S Oh, stop talking bollocks.
Comment 187.3	Yankeestan will always have a nightmare to deal with until they&#39;ll meet their imminent end ;D
Comment 187.4	No way near as big a nightmare as what Trump had to deal with after the failed policies of Obama 🙄
Comment 187.5	Only if you want to the Middle East headache to continue.
Comment188	Since man can longe reason and has been developing powerful weapons to kill because he does not finish it all at once thus avoiding with the pains of everyday feet with much suffering the innocent lives that only wish to live in Peace!

Comment 189.2	Exactly what&#39;s always been happening - WAR.
Comment190	How come BBC doesn’t cover what the Kurds have regained?<br /><br />In fact in the last 5 days, Turkey used every NATO weapon + F16s + all former isis members against some Kurdish Women in Rojava<br /><br />What Turkey has achieved? 3 villages, which YPG recaptured those villages last night, this clearly shows no ground army can defeat the Kurds on the ground. <br /><br />Christmas is close for the Kurds to roast the Turkey
Comment191	Lying BBC, have lost all their integrity. No one will ever believe what they say anymore.

Comment 193.1	@hobo dog - You are a gulf veteran. Pushing pencils in an office doing administrative duties.
Comment 193.2	@hobo dog - so the Kurds aren&#39;t allys ?
Comment 193.3	@hobo dog I&#39;ve been saying the same thing man, people just conveniently forget about Turkey being a NATO ally on the account of a group of kurds.  The US knew Turkey considered them terrorists before they armed them and continued to do so. How are fighters in a 3 year proxy war considered allies anyways?
Comment194	trump is coward.
Comment 194.1	@Charles Dickens he&#39;s withdrawing from overseas but still massively increasing defense spending.
Comment 194.2	Since when was it Americas responsibility to police the world? Why isn&#39;t the Uk, Sweden, Germany or any other European country cowards for not declaring war against Turkey?  <br /><br />Why should american lives be spent on a war that has nothing to do with America?
Comment 194.3	No, he wants to save money. War costs a LOT - and it doesn&#39;t do anything.
Comment195	Master of the naming, to avoid being called a liar - BBC News washington. Better not forget your allies next time then.
