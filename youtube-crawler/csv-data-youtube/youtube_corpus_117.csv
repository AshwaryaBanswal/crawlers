Comment1	I&#39;m from Liverpool, I&#39;m 63. I&#39;ve Voted labour all my life. I&#39;ll never vote labour again. I voted leave, not for a deal, not for a why and where for, but to leave. For those who I&#39;ve always voted for to abandon me now for there own political shenanigans is, I find, absolutely unforgivable and to forsake the will of the people for their own ill gotten gains is typical of todays society, and to leave me now, is not what I expected from a labour shadow prime minister. shame on you and shame on your party.
Comment2	Why don&#39;t they set a benefit for 60 years and over for part time work,because a big majority of people are just old and slow to do full time jobs its disgusting at this age where people are worn out phiycaly and mentally just through lifes losses ans struggles.

Comment4	Corbyn a leader is about as LOYAL to the people of this nation as he is his own arse wiping after shitting a vindaloo .... he‚Äôs not the messiah as some people think he‚Äôs our Donald Trump
Comment5	So of the 17.4 million people who voted leave, 5 million of these were Labour voters, and a grand total of 6 Labour MP&#39;s voted leave. So if there&#39;s another General election THINK ABOUT IT .
Comment6	So pleased to see Tom Watson (sitting next to Corbyn) looking so cheerful

Election needs Demanding
Comment19	&quot;project fear&quot; and &quot;millions of muslims will enter&quot;  are populist  nonsense slogans, not an answer concerning essential questions such as air companies refusing to hand over info about passengers in case of a no deal brexit and the like.
Comment20	Public should remember this deal is a remain deal with conditions.... UK public no there as always been a deal within article 50 which is within law.... Political manipulation of the law.... If UK can leave on article 50 it will give a new government freedom to create trade and build for the sake of the UK... What these.. politians.. are doing is binding any future of the UK within new treatys.... So government are bound by there stupidity
Comment21	The HOC promises to loyally subvert the democratic will of the British people and to tear up it&#39;s constitution. Oh well, at least the Remainers are saving the EU from having the bother of doing it.

Comment32	Look at Tom Watson&#39;s face.  That&#39;s my face too when I hear Corbyn&#39;s poison.  I&#39;ve had it with this BS.  There is no alternative to Johnson at this point.  He may lose pointless irrelevant parliamentary votes but he holds all the general election cards now - look how quickly they will turn the tables on Letwin for stopping &#39;the will of the people&#39;.  Labour, Lib Dems and SNP are jokes.  Bye.

Comment44	America is just like another communist country now.... No they are most worst and evil. They are all NAZI
Comment45	JC will be PM
Comment46	Boris Johnson has lost legitimacy. He did not comply with the demand for a national referendum. Boris Johnson divorced his wife and became a fool.<br />Boris Johnson was constantly cheating on his wife. He easily cheated on Brexit.<br />Imperator
Comment47	Gwen Stefani is the bloodline Soulmate of Tony Canal. Stefani is the Ancient World Fixed Twin Soul now extinct, of Owen Wilson. Owen Wilson is the bloodline Soulmate of Kate Hudson. Kate Hudson is a bloodline sister of Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn Monroe is the bloodline Soulmate of Julian Casablancas. Mata Hari aka Margaret G. Zelle, was the direct registered bloodline ancestor of Marilyn Monroe. The fashion of Gwen Stefani was stolen from Mata Hari. Public photos of Mata Hari go through a five step distortion process. Gwen Stefani is in the sister biological pool to Julian Casablancas. In order to have sexual feigning services, Julian Casablancas must pertain to Gwen Stefani as if she is the direct registered bloodline descendant of Marilyn Monroe, Amy Knorr. What happened to cause Julian Casablancas to comply? No Doubt was inspired by two bands: &quot;Quiver&quot; and &quot;Sublime&quot;. &quot;Quiver&quot; was Amy Knorr&#39;s band. Eric Wilson is a bloodline brother to Amy Knorr.<br /><br />Gwen Stefani has feigned the bloodline ancestors of Amy Knorr: Sheba, Carmencita, Nefertiti II, Cleopatra I, Cleopatra III,  V,  Genevieve,  St. Clare of Venice, Barbarella, Briacelli Gucci, Kuan Yin, Mata Hari, Marilyn Monroe, more, but at an altered perception that mimics Cleopatra II and pertains to the perception of Julian Casablancas. <br /><br />Gwen Stefani also feigns Julian Casablancas and his bloodline ancestors such as Kenneth MacLeod.<br /><br />Gwen Stefani is a Russian underworld operative and remote viewer.<br /><br />The actual appearance of Gwen Stefani resembles Joan Rivers.
Comment48	When it is pro brexit mps the BBC writes heckled, when it is pro remain mps it is abuse...

Comment53	Such a close result in the vote.... I mean I think there should be a second vote just to be sure üòÇ
Comment54	So why is Johnson and his cabal of asset strippers so afraid of putting it to the people in an informed referendum?<br />Criminal irresponsibility? what is he hiding?
Comment55	I don&#39;t want to accept the Mejority of 16 MPs, like they are not respecting the result of the referendum... No deal.
Comment56	That revolting Corbyn thing just makes everyone puke.
Comment57	Dear god we need some selfless politicians. The current crop have lost their way.
Comment58	LORD .you no iam not worthy to receive  you.but bye THE help of your grace. i shall not sin again .may the Lord Are GOD. Have MERCY upon US. and may the SOUL of the departed rest in peace ARMEN.

Comment62	politics are just IME WHICH STANDS FOR I MYSELF EMPOWERMENT
Comment63	No, Jeremy; it wasn&#39;t a &#39;clear&#39; result at all... It was several points narrower than the referendum!

Comment68	Terrorist filth
Comment69	Deal done then ruined by MP&#39;s. Labour have not only abandoned my leave vote they are attacking it.  <br />I WAS A LIFE LONG LABOUR VOTER, NOT ANY MORE!!!
Comment 69.1	Labour LOVE THE EU...even if Compo doesn&#39;t...he has to do as Starmer tells him.
Comment70	Corbyn nobody likes you !
Comment 70.1	Thats not true, the IRA love him, and many terrorist organs of Islamic jihad love him but most people of intelligence despise this parasite
Comment71	There was thousands of marching immergrants in London today the left side with the immergrant but one day they will face them selves in the mirror for what they do now and weep
Comment 71.1	Sorry could you repeat that in English? What&#39;s an imergrant?
Comment72	Bring on a corbyn government now  and reap what you&#39;ve sowed you rich Tory elite because it&#39;s the Tories who have defeated the Tories blue on blue now we need corbyn government the Marxist left will bring the rich and the country to it&#39;s knees but Putin may bail us out like he&#39;s now done in Venezuela
Comment 72.1	Lol...like fuck that&#39;s going to happen
Comment73	Ted Heath <b>TRICKED</b> the UK electorate into joining the EEC ( Common Market ) back in 1973.<br />Then later on we had the European Parlament appear out of nowhere and <b>WITHOUT A MANDATE FROM THE BRITISH PEOPLE.</b><br />WHY didn&#39;t we get a say on that?<br />We have been tricked and lied to and denied a vote on several occasions before.<br />This time we GOT a vote and certain people don&#39;t like it.
Comment 73.1	You don&#39;t get People mandates in an Oligarchy. You have HM to mandate it for you.
Comment74	"We used to hang traitors Now we vote them into positions of power, pay them huge sums of moneys and provide them with a platform from which they can propagandize us at our own expense. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MakeTreasonUnlawfulAgain"">#MakeTreasonUnlawfulAgain</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hangemhigh"">#hangemhigh</a>"
Comment75	Traitors
Comment76	I think when Article 50 was created, no one thought that exit without a deal is a lose lose scenario. When EU is faced with this situation, being pragmatic is better than ideological.
Comment77	The opposition is unwittingly bringing no deal brexit as the final result.  Most probably the real destiny of the UK is a clean break from the EU.
Comment78	Europeans now have to keep word and =NO DEAL....This happened 3-4 Times allready....theyr crazy (Briths Politics its a joke a House of Drunks and Bongo Presidents)....They arent Childrens!!And Europe isnt Santa Claus!....Great for Briths that Europeans didnt ask for a change on all this DELAYS!!Yet!
Comment79	What&#39;s the next date?
Comment80	Look&#39;s like Brexit in my next life
Comment81	Glad it was rejected. Get an extension,have an election,get a large Tory majority,vote out the bill that requires a deal and makes no-deal illegal then leave WITHOUT A DEAL
Comment82	Considering corbyn, and his fake mps do not follow the rules of democratic voting, by doing there best to block brexit.<br /><br /><br />What right does corbyn have to talk about laws?<br /><br /><br />People like corbyn are doing everything they can to block brexit. The people of uk voted, and voted out.<br /><br /><br />How does this guy speak with a straight face saying this stuff?
Comment83	Jeremy Corbyn believed before¬†that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is &quot;the wicked¬†Queen&quot; of the¬†medieval German Snow White fairy tale¬†offering¬†to &quot;Princess Snow White&quot;¬†a¬†poisoned apple when Johnson suggested to¬†rule a¬†general election¬†though Corbyn before¬†desired &quot;the apple&quot;.¬†Labour and Liberal MPs¬†together with some¬†Tory rebel MPs¬†forced¬†Boris¬†to negotiate an¬†&quot;improved&quot;¬†Brexit deal with the EU, but now &quot;Princess Snow White&quot; Corbyn and &quot;Her&quot; Dwarfs¬†don¬¥t¬†want to accept it either. What Jeremy Corbyn actually wants and who is the handsome young Prince, who has to kiss &quot;Her&quot; later? I am just curious here in Northern Europe, in the partly arctic¬†&quot;Fourth Reich&quot; EU -Province Finland.
Comment84	After all this, anyone who believes in democracy and politics after this crap needs to have their head assessed. Until we get a true representation of the majority of Britain, we will just have globalist shills, communists, self serving elitists and assortment of scum packing out the house of Lords and houses of parliament.
Comment85	referendum before is too late for everyone in the UK.
Comment 85.1	That is not democracy
Comment 85.2	"You  have had one lets  have the  best  of three  or four till  we <a href=""http://all.vote/"">all.vote</a> remain üëçüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ"
Comment 85.3	Umm, we already had s referendum, no sense in having another one just because you don‚Äôt like the result
Comment86	I have always voted labour but will never vote again for these traitorous scum ever again.<br />That includes the traitorous liberal &quot;&quot;undemocratic scum&quot;&quot;.
Comment87	Brexit has spotlighted just how INCOMPETENT these MP CLOWN&#39;S in Westminster are, and they pull 77 Grand a Year for doing NOTHING that we the electorate voted them in to DO ??? how&#39;s that for kick in the teeth.
Comment 87.1	It also highlights corruption that we didn‚Äôt realise existed
Comment88	My message to the giant children of the peoples vote march wandering the streets of London like a Zombie horde - if you want to stay in the EU fuck off and move to Europe.
Comment89	Come on then corbyn and swinson bring on election or are you still frightened
Comment90	This new deal is just as bad as the old one, Boris must know no one is going to accept.
Comment 90.1	@Wolfgang Pfeifenberger I wish it was a fake, i read this new deal and by god it is Theresa may&#39;s just with a few changes here and there. He can&#39;t believe this will get though. it will kill the Tories come next Election.<br /><br /><br />This has to be a ploy in order to get No deal though.
Comment 90.2	HistoryFan476ad Stimmt. It‚Äòs a fake.
Comment91	Corbyn and Jo Swinton  are traitors to the British people.<br />How can she call herself a liberal democrat she is a liberal UNDEMOCRATIC traitor.
Comment92	Stupid the EU is already not going to give an extension the president of the EU also really said so. The law only mean the PM has to ask but the EU does not have to give it to the UK.
Comment93	Fuck Labour . This is a disaster.
Comment94	They need to honour the first vote!!! And the vote we all voted for was to leave or stay<br /> not vote about a deal there!!!!!
Comment 94.1	@neil A Did you actually read what I wrote? If you&#39;re given two options, one decent option, and one far worse option, you&#39;d always choose the worse option? Can you actually give one good reason why you&#39;ll be better off after leaving?
Comment 94.2	@Andrew ChirgwinIt means everything belonging to the EU, Any part of it we voted to leave.
Comment 94.3	@Martin Rangel I take pride in that. If you don&#39;t protect what you have, who will.
Comment 94.4	If you have the vote before what you agreed on then what are you voting on? Imagine pitching Christmas to turkeys: &quot;It&#39;s great, spend time with family, give presents, enjoy a drink in front of a movie&quot;  &quot;...Sounds great, where do we sign?&quot; A little later: &quot;Oh, by the way, everyone eats turkey&quot;. You&#39;d want a second vote to confirm what you believed you signed up for was actually what you got.
Comment 94.5	Martin Rangel More to the point, no people are more troubled than when loyalty is split.
Comment95	Sorry speaker bercow that you have to scream for the past 10 years and especially quite intense the past 3 years just on brexit.<br />It has taken a toll on your throat in handling these children <br />Hope you have a wonderful future ahead after oct the 31st while these children continue to quarrel with each other and extend again to increase it to 4 years.
Comment 95.1	RAM 1996 he needs to leave egotistical deluded fool wrapped up in his own self importance.
Comment 95.2	Bercow is an egotistical little bully and a poisonous traitor.
Comment96	Anything‚Äôs better than the evil, dangerous and idiotic Labour Party
Comment97	Remainers claim brexit will damage our economy yet have no problem  damaging our economy to stop brexit.
Comment 97.1	@first Impression stick to trying to make friends with the rest of the sad losers on discord.
Comment 97.2	@first Impression bore off, Eurotrash.
Comment 97.3	@Joe Bloggs. Oh, I am sorry. I forgot people only cares about what you think. You are the queen for sure...drama queen indeed
Comment 97.4	@benbow7 if the eu has any financial sense, they will refuse any further delay.
Comment 97.5	The unemployment rate in Britain is half that in the eurozone and a quarter of that in Greece.  Perhaps the EU&#39;s unelected apparatchiks should sort out the disaster zone that they are presiding over before lecturing us on economics.
Comment98	Lol a big FY to Democracy
Comment99	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCxJ2cPkz1o&amp;t=0m38s"">0:38</a> - Emphatic? It was taken with a smaller winning majority than the referendum which you pussies have been claiming was not definitive enough for three years."
Comment100	<b>spits</b> that man urgh
Comment 100.1	Spits? Youre a swallow kinda girl then?
Comment101	Labour want to remain in the single market, customs union, ecj and freedom of movement ???? Basically remainüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Comment 101.1	@Arfur Fuxxakes do they fuck. Liebour want to stay. Youve got their leader.....so anti british its unreal.
Comment 101.2	@Arfur Fuxxakes unfortunately like ive said the deal labour wants is to remain in the very processes the people voted to leave ? If we remain in the customs union or the singlemarket we have to remain in the ecj and freedom of movement? Clearly this is remaining ? The people voted to leave ! If you left your job you woulnt work tuesday mornings or friday afternoons at your old company? If you leave your girlfriend you wouldnt sleep at her house or pay her bills ? 100% remain or 100% leave we voted leave.
Comment 101.3	Remain is the best deal on offer, but that isn&#39;t what Labour are proposing, that&#39;s the Libdems policy. <br /><br />Labour want a Leave Deal that protects jobs, which seems like a good idea to me.
Comment 101.4	Labour doesn¬¥t know what it wants. it just like most youtube comment like to criticize never find a real working solution.<br />Now go 16 million people who voted remain to liberal democrats.<br />Then the 17 million people who voted leave. can critize cause no real party wants to leave. not even Farage knife stabbing party.
Comment 101.5	Noooooo. Really? Fuck me there&#39;s a news flash nobody knew right there.
Comment102	Jeremy .... You know I liked you so much but you really disappoint me this time
Comment103	Now there‚Äôs a thing it‚Äôs now called the HOKEY COKEY bill and you will be singing this till the end of days?
Comment104	We want to vote for delays at the end of an extension so we can get an extension to cause delay and eventually the Brexit voters will fatigue. <br />Good luck with that
Comment105	Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Boris, stick it right up those treasonous remainers.
Comment 105.1	Long way to go.üëé
Comment106	Voted Labour my whole like but I will never again vote for a party obsessed with there own self interest rather than the people who vote for them.
Comment 106.1	Sounds like the Conservatives.
Comment 106.2	@Lost Pup oh fuck me, when someone writes an essay like that i dont even bother reading it.
Comment 106.3	@alan read  Hi Alan. I am consistently reading lifelong Labour voters as yourself say they will never vote Labour again. I&#39;ve never voted Labour and nor would I, and I&#39;m not sure if any current political party represent me. We all MUST vote in next general election, but who for?.
Comment 106.4	@ian loveland braindead? How you deduce that i dont know. Politics isnt your forte.......stick to the back page of the sun.
Comment 106.5	The Labour Party abandoned the white working class decades ago and despise them thoroughly now.
Comment107	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW25SE1dJU4"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW25SE1dJU4</a> - nice <br />lightning strike"
Comment108	Well said Jeremy. <br /><br />Tories should learn that their sense of entitlement doesn&#39;t put them above the law.
Comment109	As Geoffrey Cox said, this parliament is a dead parliament. Remainers simply will not let the country leave.
Comment 109.1	@Arfur Fuxxakes Projecting your frustration is understandable. Anger at having been lied to and losing the referendum<br />is commonplace and I do sympathise. But we are leaving the EU, that is the inescapable fact, and the sooner you acclimatise to reality the easier it will be for you to cope mentally, pal.
Comment 109.2	@Jamie Johnson <br /><br />You&#39;re projecting. <br /><br />You are the one that bought into lies.<br /><br />It&#39;s not your fault you&#39;re gullible,  but it&#39;s time you woke up to reality. <br /><br />You should direct your anger at those who sold you the lie, not those who tried to warn you that you were being lied to.<br /><br />But you&#39;ve invested so much of yourself into promoting the lies that you&#39;re too ashamed to admit it. <br /><br />I do pity you for being so manipulated, you just weren&#39;t mentally equipped enough to see it.
Comment 109.3	@Arfur Fuxxakes The only fact here is you were sold lies that did not materialise, and you need to come to terms with that, and while you&#39;re at it, come to terms with the outcome of the referendum, and the fact that it WILL be delivered, pal.
Comment 109.4	@Jamie Johnson <br /><br />Grow up pal.<br /><br />At least I have facts, which is more than you do.<br /><br />You appear pointless.
Comment110	Lol, it‚Äôs funny, yes Boris has to send the pre written letter the Ben bill mandates him to do.. but the law dose not require him to negotiate an extension.. he will continue to tell Eu member states to not grant the extension request or there be considered to be having hostile intentions towards the political interest of the duly elected government of Britain and lose its favour.... Remember, it only takes 1 member state to deny the extension request... so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to be the EU that now impose ‚Äúits either this deal or no deal‚Äù I think the deals ok, if we get a general election so the Parliament arranging the future is not this bunch of muppets.... I feel the same about no deal... providing this parliament is booted out Britain will be fine!!! I‚Äôm really board of this now!!! If labour go into a general election with corbyn as leader there not even be the major opposition party! Brexit needs to get done!
Comment111	Corbyn, have a ball and convene an election. You cant keep force an extensions without taking the initiative to led the issue.
Comment 111.1	Corbyn thinks hes been playing it smart by sitting on the fence. He will be roundly punished for it at the next GE for not making ANY position clear on the most controversial political issue of the last generation. Easy to make him look weak and spineless, because he is.
Comment112	When One EU member like France vetos the delay, what might happen? Could House of Commons defeat that veto?
Comment 112.1	R G we‚Äôll see
Comment 112.2	@R G That too.
Comment 112.3	No one will veto the delay.
Comment 112.4	No. If anyone vetoes in the EU, it&#39;s game over.
Comment113	FREE ASSANGE
Comment114	3 cheers for our MPs<br />Hip hip delay<br />Hip hip delay<br />Hip hip delay
Comment 114.1	Communist not welcome in uk go home
Comment 114.2	FakeDollars WTO is the legal default.  Letwins amendment will be ignored.  MPs didn‚Äôt know what they were voting for.
Comment 114.3	@Steve Liberator If its Writen :) its law...if no!bb
Comment 114.4	Fortunately Johnson has written to all MPs to tell them the Letwin amendment is contrary to the will of the people. They have a choice between Johnson‚Äôs deal, or a WTO Clean Brexit.<br /><br />Macron agreed: no delay.  Deal or no deal.
Comment 114.5	The UK dodged the bullet, ...but for how long?
Comment115	This is MPs in westminster not allowing for what we wanted - BREXIT. It is NOT Boris Johnsons fault. I watched the whole lot and it is a total joke in parliament. Fuck Oliver Letwin - They can all go to hell. KEEP GOING BORIS! Until the fat lady sings!
Comment116	THE BBC WAS GIVEN ¬£9,000,000 MILLION FROM THE EU TO RUN AN ANTI BREXIT CAMPAIGN AND WAS FUNNELED IN THROUGH A BACK DOOR FOUNDATION <br />THE BBC ARE TOTALLY BIAS AND CORRUPT
Comment 116.1	I NEVER, EVER BELIEVE IT
Comment 116.2	@Wili Wds son? So whos google ran by? Hmmmm. Let me thinks. Just one of the richest men in the world. You dont believe multimedia but you do believe google.......pmsl.....youre a fool. I dont think you understand what you&#39;re writing.
Comment 116.3	@Born Yesterday yeah I never believe mainstream media that are all owned by multi-millionaires and ran by Far Left Socialist SCUM so keep searching son
Comment117	The politicians are killing the UK economy.<br />They have caused untold damage to their own people,<br />the very people whom they are supposed to protect.
Comment 117.1	you want hitler Johnson will oblige
Comment 117.2	Spent more on public services? <br /><br />Obviously you haven&#39;t used any recently.
Comment 117.3	@Azrael Yeah that is the most basic job a government has. It&#39;s why we have a ministry of defence.
Comment 117.4	Lol you think the government is supposed to protect us üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Comment 117.5	@Libertarian Left, Right, all a fake game designed to steal money from all of the people. Dont expect any of these asshats to end wars or cut off the tap for the weapons companies. The government moves from fake left to fake right every so often so they can steal from the groups the last party didnt, and pretend to give to the others. Tick tock tick tock. Idiots cheering &quot;their&quot; party like a football team while their choice picks their pocket with new taxes, inflation and cost-of-living increases, moving that money from public to private hands, all while pretending they are not. Worst is Labour as their devotees are stupid to think that multi-millionaire Corbyn gives two craps about what they want outside of them sticking a tick in a box for him. Pathetic.
Comment118	Each nation has their betrayers! For cheap labor, Those betrayers are even  willing to import terroists !!!
Comment 118.1	@benbow7 <br /><br />Why would you trust a White Supremacist to give you a balanced account of history? <br /><br />It&#39;s obvious what his agenda is and therefore would only be appreciated by people who want their own prejudices confirmed rather than challenged. <br /><br />Echo chambers are poor places to learn.
Comment 118.2	It isn&#39;t just about cheap labour.  If you want to see the source of the ideas that are destroying the West, and the deep motives behind those ideas, try reading The Culture of Critique by Professor Kevin MacDonald.  It&#39;s banned by all mainstream booksellers but can still be downloaded for free online as a PDF.  It&#39;s the only book I&#39;ve seen that explains perfectly the history of the last century and the ongoing events that we see around us today.
Comment 118.3	@Infernal460 <br /><br />Grow up chum,  you appear ridiculous.
Comment 118.4	@Arfur Fuxxakes Yes, really.
Comment 118.5	Really?
Comment119	Delays after Delays 3 years have been passed for Fudge sake let the people to decide a referendum what exactly want. a referendum that to remain and leave and after that a vote of what they want a no deal or a deal. but nooo parlament doesnt care about the people so what i can say that this country is ruined on every term.  Heres my opinion Just remain in Eu for couple of years and when your ready to leave please let parlament to plan a deal until they gonna bring a leave referendum.

Comment124	So, Boris gets shot down in flames... again... despite promising <br /><br /><br />with such great bravado that if his ‚Äúfantastic new deal‚Äù was voted on, <br /><br /><br />we would be ‚Äúmoving forward‚Äù...‚Äù <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />‚ÄúLet&#39;s get ‚Äúthis‚Äù(?) done...‚Äù he and those wonderful trustworthy brexiters <br /><br /><br />huffed and puffed... Well if... IF ‚Äúbrexit was done‚Äù - and given that the<br />government&#39;s ‚Äúnew deal‚Äù has been amended to include divergence -<br />it would hardly be over as it would then take years and years to<br />renegotiate trade deals with the EU - and especially with other<br />countries - some of which have taken over a decade.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />They said brexit would ‚ÄúProvide certainty...‚Äù and a ‚ÄúFantastic opportunity...‚Äù <br /><br /><br />Oh really? Then why not release the government&#39;s own figures on the<br />previous deal and issue a detailed economic impact assessment of <br />this ‚Äúnew, excellent‚Äù brexit deal that Moggy now wants to eat?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />‚ÄúBe a democrat...‚Äù they yelled... LOL... Does Govey mean like asking to vote <br /><br /><br />for the FOURTH time on a ‚Äúnew‚Äù deal no one really wants - and even<br />treasonous little niggle fartmirage has condemned - but not approve<br />of a vote to ensure the legislation of this ‚Äúfantastic deal‚Äù -<br />that the likes of Duncan full of ukrap say the government is<br />‚Äúcommitted‚Äù to achieve - is suitably scrutinized and approved?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />‚ÄúHonour the referendum result...‚Äù they regurgitate... Oh really? <br /><br /><br />Do they meanthe one that was dishonourably presented - especially by <br /><br /><br />the present, unelected ‚Äúdemocrat‚Äù of a prime minister who, after three and<br />half years, has been thoroughly exposed for the shameless, lying<br />opportunist that he is - even by his own brother and sister as well<br />as over 21 conservative MPs who put country before party!  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />‚ÄúTaking back control...‚Äù they harp on.... Or taking the piss? What it WILL take<br />and require is a lengthy transition period in which the ‚Äúunited‚Äù<br />kingdom will remain under full EU obligations and laws, but have no<br />say or representation, as it continues to abide by EU rules but lose<br />membership of its institutions. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Or do they mean that the REAL elite parasites - especially in the city of London ‚Äì <br /><br /><br />will be taking back deregulated control instead of having to comply with<br />new bankster and tax havens regulation with the implementation of a<br />level playing field ‚Äì which also would further thwart the ‚Äúspecial<br />relationship‚Äù with the ‚Äúunited‚Äù states?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(btw... Anyone else notice that when Boris was not there during the ‚Äúdeliberations‚Äù,<br />more often than not, neither was the remembrancer... shorely shum coincidence... <br /><br /><br />wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And not forgetting it&#39;s a ‚ÄúCracking deal‚Äù for Northern Ireland...‚Äù <br /><br /><br />Shame the DUPdoesn&#39;t thinks so...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />So, at the end of the day, the ONLY way to stop the uncertainty and END the treasonous<br />brexit fiasco and truly secure a better future - and not only of our relationship with the EU.
Comment 124.1	@Libertarian The remainers in parliament are guilty of treason under British law. The entire EU project was always illegal under British law
Comment 124.2	Depends on your definition, the crime of betraying one&#39;s country, yes probably guilty, get the ropes.
Comment 124.3	@Libertarian The fact that he is wrongly accusing people of treason is important.
Comment 124.4	It doesn&#39;t matter what nationality he is, what matters is that the dishonesty of the political class laid bare for all to see.
Comment 124.5	You are not British, moron.
Comment125	Corbyn is a total muppet...has no backbone, 2 year olds have more strength of character than this absolute melt!

Comment134	Every time Corbyn speaks he sends me into fits of laughter..... he is a joke. He does not know what to oppose next. He is pathetic.
Comment 134.1	MrKarmoy1 they are paid by the government to do a job. He seems to take his more seriously than others
Comment 134.2	@Jeffery Jeff My father was a working class union leader.  Took him years to realise what Labour and unions really are...   Corbyn has no idea what it is to do a weeks work....he has scrounged off the government all his life.. and many in Labour like him.

Comment 147.1	Their voter base did not come from the EU. In fact 95% is from the Third World colonies. The Brexit will restore the colonial quotas and the English will get replaced.
Comment 147.2	Stupid or lying troll I wonder?

Comment 154.1	@Arfur Fuxxakes don&#39;t mind him bro
Comment 154.2	@DANNY BOY and that&#39;s how investors, manufacturers, traders and whole country&#39;s progress stuck in, when democracy workes. And that&#39;s how silly politicians works for their own progress üòú
Comment 154.3	That&#39;s how democracy works. The very time labour were in power, conservative always opposed them too.<br />That&#39;s why they are called opposition
Comment155	Dear EU.  Please extend. I have to ask by law. Love Boris xxx . Ps. Please also ignore this letter. Goodbye EU.
Comment156	i like Boris but this &quot;deal&quot; is absolute trash. need to crash out of the EU.
Comment157	Parliament VS the people again. The UK needs a GE NOW.
Comment158	To be fair, a delay and an election would finally set this mess straight because it would give a future government enough power to deny any opposition the vote on a deal. Right now the MAIN reason why boris will never ever get what he wants with regards to the eu is because he does not have any power at all.
Comment159	I heard a Brexiteer on Radio 4 this morning he said &quot;forget morality, forget the welfare of the British people. Just get it done&quot;.  He is a moron. To believe that actual harm to the British people doesn&#39;t matter should be the preserve of hereditary parasites like Rees-Mogg. Did you see his delight when he thought he saw  the deal going through? All those options he has are going to make him very wealthy indeed. If us peasants suffer; tough! He can follow his money to the side of a swimming pool in a tax haven.
Comment 159.1	@Reality Always Bully‚Äôs Opinion The problem is that really stupid people like you know all the answers. Have you read any economics text book in your life? No, I thought not but you are convinced that you are an expert. The Economist  knows nothing but in your great wisdom you know better. You are the Turkeys who voted for Christmas.

Comment 169.3	@Happy Chappy .... I hate that for you. It&#39;s the same thing here with this attempted impeachment of Mr Trump. I&#39;m for Brexit because I&#39;m for sovereignty and self determination. Please make sure it gets done. The world needs Brexit. The WHOLE world needs Brexit!
Comment 169.4	We are trying to restore our DEMOCRACY in the UK  Parliament is against the PEOPLE.<br />The Government will not recognize the result of the biggest ever vote in the UK  which was to LEAVE THE EU.<br />THE PEOPLE ARE BEING DENIED THEIR VOTE

Comment173	Can someone help me understand what is the Letwin amendment and what if PM rejects to delay the Brexit.
Comment 173.1	@ÊñπÂáØËà™ If the EU does not accept the request of delay from The UK Government, The UK will leave the EU on October 31st with no deal. But, that&#39;s my thought. With the current situation, no one can know what tomorrow will be.
Comment 173.2	Gia B·∫£o Ph·∫°m Tr·∫ßn thanks for the explanation. Does exist other options that PM can take for avoiding the delay of the Brexit?
Comment 173.3	When the Letwin amendment is passed, The Parliament will not vote for the PM&#39;s Brexit Deal and the PM must goes to Brussels and asks the EU for the delay of Brexit (that&#39;s mean: The UK must not leave the EU on October 31st).
