Comment37	This is is absolutely inhumane , If a certain religion does it then such religion should be completely destroyed otherwise our future generations will die every moment of their life.
Comment 37.1	@Yassine St u ppl destroy Hindu temples, destroy Hindu culture , also kill Hindus and yet want all benefits from Hindustan . U ppl r so shameless and mannerless that we gave u Pakistan but still living in India and creating nuisance in public through mosques. We don&#39;t want to hear the name of ur demonic God from whose name billions of Hindus and other religions r affected. U ppl lack humanity. Hinduism has helped many other religions to survive and flourish and never forces anyone to convert but u ppl by threatening convert ppl and destroy all other cultures
Comment 37.2	@Yassine St In ur so called religion which is a scumbag it only kills people and subjects women  to horrific torture. Whatever that African spoke in the video didn&#39;t u hear it deaf,  he told in the name of religion they&#39;re torturing us.

Comment44	BBC REPORTING!<br />These are British favorite  Nigerian citizens.<br />The people responsible for this atrocity are British favorite Nigerian citizens through whom Britain puppeteers Nigeria 59 years after fake independence.<br />I keep asking this question if any of the people favored by Britain to &quot;RULE&quot;  Nigeria would be allowed to serve as British Prime minister or Dog Catcher for one Day.<br />The evil that men do live after them.<br />Britain, the citadel of Hypocrisy.
Comment45	Religion of peace is back !!

Comment 47.2	same I noticed that in other sources
Comment48	<i>&quot;Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.&quot;</i> - <b>Steven Weinberg</b><br /><br />or do you truly believe the aggressors are doing just for the &quot;lols&quot;!?
Comment 48.1	@Allan_GG that&#39;s y u need to get some grammar skills to get what im saying
Comment 48.2	@Mean Old Lady I believe Christianity is a peaceful religion like others, I believe all religions all peaceful but it ain&#39;t the only religion who hasn&#39;t done widespread killing, Christianity gave us the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, the anti-Jewish pogroms, European colonialism in Africa and Asia, the Lord&#39;s Resistance Armies in Uganda not to mention countless arson and bomb attacks on Abortion clinics in the USA still to this very day.  And 113/114 chapters of the Qur&#39;an begin with saying that Our Lord is the most merciful, not a Greek-like god of war or wrath, and yes we are ALSO NOT commanded to kill people in the name of Allah (SWT) or in the name of The Prophet Muhammad (SAW). You should get your facts right and actually do some study mate, no offense to anyone, everyone is unique and nice. If it hadn&#39;t of my religion Islam, I wouldn&#39;t be the person I am today. I am also not told to go kill people in the streets but rather help and care for others. &lt;3
Comment 48.3	Atheism is also an insult to human dignity as it commits atrocities on a grand scale.<br />Atheist &quot;utopianism&quot; is the second deadliest ideology in human history with 120+ million dead in just 100 years.<br />Only islam is worse with 669+ million over 1400 years.<br />Christianity is the only religion that elevates human dignity where everyone has inherent value.<br />Now deaths attributed to Christianity are estimated between 9-28 million, but Jesus did NOT command his followers to kill in his name unlike muhammad or atheist dictators.
Comment 48.4	@jaswanth jc And also can u get ur grammar straight, I don&#39;t understand you particularly.
Comment 48.5	@jaswanth jc Americans killed innocent civilians? And the whole world supports it? What are u even saying?
Comment49	worst boarding school EVERRR
Comment50	The sorry , lowdown , rotten pieces of sht that did this will get what&#39;s coming. Not a damn one of them can hide from the boogeyman that&#39;s coming for them.
Comment51	I remember when they used to call it character building.  Always was an excuse.  They&#39;ll always be one of them who just likes the routine.  Suppose you get it a bit worse at those Islamic schools.
Comment52	Islam haters like this kind of video to promote their hatred and falsehood. This school is not following Islamic guidelines. It&#39;s a bid&#39;ah school. In other words, those running it are not considered Ahlus Sunnah Wal-Jamaa&#39;ah/Salafiyyah (the main body of Islam that are upon the truth of Islam and will be saved from Hellfire and admitted to eternal Paradise). Ahlul Bid&#39;ah (the deviated sects) are the 72 sects that claim to be Muslims who are upon falsehood and they will all end up in Hellfire. Islam prohibits abuse, torture and oppression of all kind. And no one is forced to become a Muslim or practice Islam.<br />(Muhsin Khan and Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali)<br />There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.<br />-Sura Al-Baqarah, Ayah 256 <br />As for slavery, Islam forbids enslaving people. Slaves and booties are only allowed in true Jihaad (led by a legitimate Muslim Ruler and it doesn&#39;t happen easily),  not the fake Jihaad of the Khawarij- ISIS, Alqa&#39;eda, Boko Haram, etc). These (slaves) are enemy fighters who attack and want to destroy Muslims. So anybody who hates this exception rule is a hater or an enemy and we Muslims don&#39;t listen to haters. Propaganda media attacked Sheikh Fawzaan  حفظه الله for mentioning Islamic ruling on slavery and Salafis ignored the haters. But enslaving any free person is not allowed.
Comment53	Britain needs to fly these poor men to Britain, give them citizenship and full welfare benefits.
Comment 53.1	@Khadr Trudeau <br /><br />You really are quite pathetic.
Comment 53.2	@Arfur Fuxxakes OK, then just citizenship. They can then vote Labour.
Comment 53.3	Too clumsy. <br /><br />You should be more subtle with your trolling.
Comment54	Because all the leaders in the north want power to continue breeding terrorist organizations it&#39;s consuming them now many years of their rulling we are seeing the results
Comment55	Africa.... As a great philosopher once said,<br />there is only one secret for absolute failure. <br />Consistency.
Comment56	Isnt Islam wonderful.
Comment57	"<a href=""https://youtu.be/CDzwHKeo3Ns"">https://youtu.be/CDzwHKeo3Ns</a>   To expose the black terror of Hong Kong&#39;s opposition, what the world needs is the truth!"
Comment58	Get the fuck out of here!! I’m getting sick of Nigeria and their BS they have a Military.... why is this Narrative coming out of Nigeria... The Great African Scam Artists?  And the Headline is “Nigeria: Police rescue chained students from Islamic school” if grown men are being chained up and there is No physical damage(they’re not fighting back) it’s just not True this is Some kind of BS Nigeria is on with the West I suspect they are Trying to get military Aid and money to help fight The Muslims
Comment59	The northern Nigeria is nothing but useless people . no human right.  I&#39;m shame to come from Nigeria. Because this northern people are the problems we has in Nigeria. They has been in power, for many year&#39;s and nothing is working.  They love darkness . they are too backwards. And Uk is supporting them.
Comment 59.1	micheal chinedu and sadly most modern day brits don’t even understand that’s it’s the retrogressive north that the brits put in charge of Nigeria that’s preventing us in the south from parting ways and progressing just like how we’ve always progressed that’s how the brits control and exploit Nigeria or any other western nation through these illiterate dumb northern elites
Comment60	Post this video to David lammy on twitter. All of you.
Comment61	Theres also history of child abuse in British boarding schools, covered up by British governments who are believed to be Christians. Do we blame everyone in government and tarnish them with the same brush?
Comment 61.1	@Mean Old Lady not only Christianity but also Hinduism teaches us that whole world is one family- sanskrit version &quot;Vasudaiva kutumbakam &quot;. We people have endured ruthless torture for generations for being good. I hope this dirty religion vanishes away from the world so that our future generations live peacefully
Comment 61.2	Expose them for not following Jesus&#39; commands for his followers &amp; expose them for their child abuse.<br />In islam, muhammad commanded his cultists to rape, engage in paedophilia &amp; mass murder.<br />Jesus did NOT command those things of his followers, but expressed how terrible it would be on the day of judgment for those that abuse children.<br />Muhammad married a 6 year old &amp; consummated the marriage when she was 9 &amp; he was 54.<br />Islam is a cult of paedophiles, rapists &amp; mass murderers.  Christianity is not.
Comment62	Nigeria... where the Christian right wing has been importing their capitalist Christian (christofascist) ideology to the detriment of decency and human rights.
Comment 62.1	Capitalism is how they get out of 3rd world status &amp; Christianity is what allows them to thrive as people of dignity unlike islam &amp; atheism.<br />Under atheism &amp; islam, people suffer under totalitarian dictatorships &amp; million die because people are expendable &amp; have no inherent value.<br />Islam &amp; atheism are the 2 deadliest ideologies in history.<br />Islam - 669+ million deaths/1400 years<br />Atheist &quot;utopianism&quot; - 120+ million/100 years
Comment63	Some with the same or similar ideologies are fully welcomed into Canada by Trudeau. Past govts haven&#39;t been much better and political correctness, naivety and stupidity sadly exists with many in every political party. Trudeau just happens to be the worst.
Comment64	Lol so they talk about this and not about the shit happening in China to muslims.😤
Comment65	Usually when such &quot;news&quot; is made public it is a sign that they run out of money we gave them not long ago and  i would expect Nigeria to be begging us for more money to fight &quot;terrorists&quot;
Comment66	Can&#39;t u guys give us more news than just that
Comment67	What happened there
Comment68	How curious that so many troll haters want to focus on the religion only when it&#39;s Islam. <br /><br />When it&#39;s Catholic nuns doing the same with the Magdalen Laundries the religion gets kept out of it.<br /><br />All religions are about controlling people, some are more backwards than others.
Comment 68.1	My religion doesn&#39;t ask me to go to temple compulsorily and even Atheists r respected in my religion. My religion is based on Karma- what u sow is what u reap
Comment 68.2	Not all religions r controlling . I was searching for u from past 3 days and now I found u. See when majority of people chant the name of God and do evil then there&#39;s some reason behind.
Comment69	A liberal Muslim tries to justify (They don&#39;t represent the real Islam)<br /><br />Me :- Ahh shit here we go again
Comment70	Just like the the good old days ! Only need buyer&#39;s now , not white though they still get the blame hundreds of years later .Never their own people ...💩💩💩
Comment71	there is no compulsion in religion but try getting out of your chains lol.
Comment72	Environment alert..<br />India is releasing flood water in large amounts into oceans..<br />*it causes change in ocean currents..<br />**the released water is a mixture of stagnant water which was hold by reserviour..<br />It properties PH..composition of gas mixture..vary from natural river water..that flows into ocean..<br />As a result aquatic life in ocean that are in the span of other countries..procure diseases..<br />Some may die and decay in the oceans..as such..the corresponding country&#39;s citizen health can be ruined..<br />UNO..or corresponding governing bodies..should monitor this issue..and restrict India from building.reserviours of high capacity..reduce the storage capacity..or optimum maintenance level...
Comment73	Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction. Blaise Pascal
Comment 73.1	Nevermind that atheist &quot;utopianism&quot; is the second deadliest ideology in history that&#39;s killed 120+ million people in just 100 years.<br />Islam has the highest death count at 669+ million over 1400 years.<br />Deaths attributed to Christian elements (which Jesus told them NOT to do, unlike muhammad) are between 9-29 million over 2000 years.<br />So take that pro-atheism stance &amp; cram it right up your ass.
Comment74	Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction. Blaise Pascal
Comment 74.1	<i>&quot;Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.&quot;</i> - <b>Steven Weinberg</b>
Comment75	This would not have happened had Nigeria been under white rule.
Comment 75.1	@Amir Shehu - Islam brought mass rape &amp; murder - enslaving 11+ million Africans &amp; killing 120+ million of them.<br />Your false prophet called them raisin heads &amp; claimed that Shaitan was a black man with long hair, inflamed eyes &amp; ruddy cheeks.<br />Islam was a cult of white supremacists that go on &amp; on about how white muhammad was, even having a death penalty for anyone who claimed he wasn&#39;t white.<br />There are STILL slave trades going on worldwide because of islam, including slave markets in Libya today.<br />Muhammad kicked off his criminal career as a (caravan) robber &amp; you cultists still carry out his depraved desires &amp; traditions today.<br />Nigeria was doing well under Christianity &amp; then islam moved in &amp; is turning it into yet another islamic hellscape.
Comment 75.2	White Man if you think you said anything factual or sensible you are fully demented
Comment 75.3	White Man another illiterate ignorant supremacists white person that knows nothing except spout nonsense I’m done responding to your types because there is no need
Comment 75.4	@babatope orimogunje what you did there is a classic case of &quot;pass the buck&quot;. I dont represent nothing. Fuck off. And Christianity did the same thing
Comment 75.5	@Amir Shehu - So the other contending and pervading religion you represent and speak for did not destroy African history, civilization and her people? Shame on all of you rivals in these crimes.

Comment90	This has happened again.
Comment91	meanwhile majority of the black community in london are more interested in talking about the whiteman!
Comment92	Sadly the comments are shitshow, proceed at your own risk.
Comment 92.1	Because you could say the same thing about Christianity and no one does. Christians have been just as bloody thirsty and violent but they&#39;ve had 2000 yrs to shake their shit out and it devolve into cultural Christianity for most of those in the west. Comparaitaively Islam has only 1000 yrs to shake it&#39;s shit out and they are stuck in the throws of violence that most religions create by default (in and out groups).
Comment 92.2	I see pretty well every comment is stating facts about islam. Tell us why you disagree.
Comment93	The religion of peace
Comment 93.1	@AMHD but you did assumed he was a Christian sooooo
Comment 93.2	@game box well he hasn&#39;t said that has he plus he hasn&#39;t replied to my comment because he knows that there is no verse in the Quran which promotes violence
Comment 93.3	@Amir Shehu that wasn&#39;t ment for you
Comment 93.4	@AMHD well if he is a atheist, the Bible line won&#39;t work mate
Comment 93.5	@game box what?
Comment94	Gotta love religion 😒
Comment 94.1	Tom Clyburn I gave up on it a while back
Comment95	I pray they all find their family&#39;s! And maybe even go back and find the people who did this to them.....and take care of that problem!
Comment 95.1	1.4 million Muslims, could take a while.
Comment96	Why isn&#39;t the Nation of Islam speaking about this? Where is Farrakhan?
Comment 96.1	@Arfur Fuxxakes  when srilankan,philiphanes,nigerian christain attacked by so called isis,where are the islamist country leaders....u are a selfish man no one going to listern to ur ugly words
Comment 96.2	@Arfur Fuxxakes chtistain dont explode in public place,not marrying 12 year old child,dont compress their minority people unlike islamic country,dont give shulter to terrorist like osama,hafiz saeed etc
Comment 96.3	@Tresor <br /><br />What you are saying goes for Islam too.<br /><br />That&#39;s my whole point.<br /><br />Thanks for emphasising it.<br /><br />The actions of a few are not representative of the whole.
Comment 96.4	@Arfur Fuxxakes You seem to be classifying a selected few individuals to an entire religion. I will say this again, Evangelists elected Trump. Yes they are Christians and no, they would never criticize him because of they are morally blind and in fact I can go further and call them hypocrites. Evangelists do not represent the entire Christian religion. I really hope you understand these differences because every religion does have sectors and they tend to disagree within themselves or sometimes claim they &quot;are more Christian&quot; than the others.
Comment97	Send presentive Omar to that school.
Comment98	Thought it said me and the boys
Comment99	Slavery...still &quot;nothing to do with islam&quot; I guess.
Comment 99.1	@Fatima Ahli y would u use Akbar&#39;s name , he killed thousands of ppl, raped thousands of women,  and killed many Indian kings. How can he be great?
Comment 99.2	@Jai Hind Not everyone is using it in the right way. I wish I could explain how, but I don&#39;t know how. I hope I answered ur question.
Comment 99.3	@Jai Hind  we say allah akbar (which means  god is the greatest) when we pray and at other times. Basically it doesn&#39;t inherent political/violent connotation meriting instant terror diagnosis.
Comment 99.4	@Fatima Ahli they chant it as achievement or punishment ?
Comment 99.5	@Fatima Ahli I don&#39;t know but some ppl chant Allah oh Akbar before killing someone and I&#39;ve seen in some videos. Y?
Comment100	The enslavers are doing what Islam has taught them.
Comment 100.1	Fahad Malik Your intellect is non existent. The truth will out. Islamist is dead...
Comment 100.2	@Jigsaw John What ever air whisper...
Comment 100.3	Fahad Malik I am not forcing nothing onto people. That&#39;s what religious extremists do. I just refuse to allow people who have been indoctrinated, to spout lies. Which is why I question people like you...
Comment 100.4	@Jigsaw John Do as you wish. But do not force things onto people.
Comment 100.5	Fahad Malik haha. Dream on. I am the truth, and you are the lie. You are He, who praises evil. Your Taqqiya has been seen. We are not fooled anymore...
Comment101	I am going to launch a new religion   ( mayadonika) and i am the father of god . We charge 1000/$ for a conversion .
Comment102	And people in America act like their lives are sooo hard lol
Comment 102.1	OutOfSight123 This shit ain’t Real grown ass men being called “students” this shit is some kind of trick to get money from the West Nigeria has an Army
Comment103	Death to islam
Comment104	Fuck Islam
Comment105	I have always heard rumors about boarding schools, but this is just taking the biscuit!!!!!
Comment 105.1	Such brutality happens here in the UK in Islamic teaching centres and Madrasa&#39;s but as it doesn&#39;t fit the &quot;multicultural , diversity is strength Left Wing narrative &quot; it never gets reported or investigated ....a bit like the tens of thousands of White British and Sikh girls raped , abused and in some cases murdered over the last 20 to 30 years
Comment106	Islam has enslaved &amp; castrated millions of African black Men and Boys<br /><br /><br />This is your future once Muslims outnumber you in your homeland
Comment107	No offence but Islam is a very primitive religion compering to Christianity or Buddhism.
Comment108	Louis Farrakhan needs to watch that
Comment109	Not to belittle the abhorrent treatment those people have been through, but there is a 30-million race in a far worse conditions inside the &#39;secular&#39; reeducation camps of China  (Uighurs detention camps)
Comment110	WHY Aren&#39;t You REPORTING On The Slaughter &amp; Terrorizing Of CHRISTIANS ???!!    # Not Politically Correct Enough ?!
Comment111	Slavery is wrong.
Comment 111.1	Wow.
Comment112	Caregivers/Parents teaching children harsh lessons for bad behavior should question their decisions. Being a unskilled caregivers/parent should have been addressed by the school too.  <br /><br />The school should have counseled the caregiver/parent in the same manner since they thought they were helping their children.
Comment113	Poor africans, without diversity we are nothing haha
Comment 113.1	@Umar Tanveer LMAO - THEY ARE ALL BLACK
Comment 113.2	@White Man I&#39;m Nigerian, it&#39;s made quite apparent you&#39;ve ether never set foot in Nigeria or you&#39;re full of lies. Nigeria is very multicultural. there are so many tribes there and some Lebanese, Chinese and others in Nigeria too..<br /><br />Dam trolls everywhere these days
Comment 113.3	Don&#39;t reply to &quot;White Man&quot; as it is most probably a Chinese or Russian troll just trying to stir up controversy.  His accounts has 6 subscribers with absolutely no videos, likes or other content.  Just a shell of an account, or should that be &quot;shill of an account?&quot;
Comment 113.4	@White Man I&#39;m sorry, I forgot that the most deadly war in human history came from Africa? I&#39;m also sorry that Europeans constantly waged war on each other for 99% of human history? You forgot to mention that didnt you, ignorant tool
Comment 113.5	@White Man there is no need for more than one race for continent, just a peace paper between all, and thats it
Comment114	Slavery is alive and well everywhere but the West. The West ended slavery.
Comment 114.1	@Andy N I am curious why you deleted your previous. <br /><br />Capitalists are the cause of slavery ? Show us one example, just one example anywhere in the world at anytime in history that anyone dodged the bullets of the border guards, clawed their way through the barb wire fences to escape capitalism. Just one example anywhere in the world at anytime in history. Fair ?
Comment 114.2	@White Man Obama was a Capitilist. Boris Johnson&#39;s right hand man Savid Javid is a Capitilist.. Are they white? No.. Its all about greed and making others suffer for it, no matter what colour or nationality they are,, Capitilists are the biggest part and cause of modern slavery.
Comment 114.3	@Andy N Lets be pro-white for a change instead of always hating on whitey.
Comment 114.4	The white male ended slavery. Never forget - it was the white male who ended slavery.
Comment115	I wish i had super mans powers...the things i would do for mother earth...and her children...
Comment 115.1	@El dorado namaste my Friend
Comment 115.2	@Vayne Carudas Solidor fare enough... But only i know me...
Comment 115.3	yeah, about that... _&quot;The road to hell is paved with good intentions&quot;. just read history about many tyrants ans you will know it. with super-powers you probably wouldn&#39;t be very careful, so collateral damage would turn you... well... into a villain of history.
Comment 115.4	Balance Through The Go...you&#39;ll do nothing you idiot..
Comment116	Why do not  u talk about what France do in Africa ? Stealing their gold and their natural sources then  come and put the blame on a religion
Comment 116.1	White Man Race is not a determining factor about brain capacity because you stem from us and we educated you in a Nigerian from the south I’m a teacher that teaches proper history not the brainwashed European curriculum that’s being taught as a general curriculum round west Africa that led to developments you see such as this, Finally if anything even if were being so shallow minded to base this off of race the Western Europeans would be the worse thing to ever ever happened in the history of earth and mankind.
Comment 116.2	White Man you have to read this Incase you think you’re people really liberated and left a working system behind the system is a system designed to fail and it’s the people who are backdated and know nothing the northern elites that the British people deliberately left in charge to make all the decisions, take your time to read this all the bad news you see coming from Nigeria everything is from the north from Boko Haram and what ever, the southern part is extremely wealthy and progressive yet they don’t make the decisions the northern part leaches of the south and deliberately hinders their growth because the northern elites see nothing beyond oil these are the people your kind left to rule the country because they are backdated zombies the perfect puppets for exploitation, they are so backdated that during the civil war in Nigeria when the southern part decided to restructure the country to leave by a referendum and they went into war in which the brits gave the same northerners weapons to massacre the progressive south to maintain control, after the war after the brits had their way with the northern elites the same northerners stole a lot of resources from the south a lot of their land and still as we speak now the south still came again from back and is still doing far better than the same north in charge, so please stop with this imperialist agenda if anything the brits are the cause of their own problems everything you did is back firing in your faces because you hate development because you want to maintain white dominance as always
Comment 116.3	Just to Arab countries? What about the pp that UK and Spain and Portugal took to latin America as slaves  just France has enslaved almost 50% of African ppl and killed millions
Comment 116.4	Why you not talk about the millions of slaves taken from africa to arab countries ?
Comment117	This is Islam, the very cult you&#39;ve helped push onto western society!!
Comment 117.1	@i dont get it and here stupid people are Islamic🤣🤣🤣

Comment 117.4	@benbow7 <br />The founder of Islam? 😂<br />No thanks, that sounds too made up for me to care more
Comment118	I can&#39;t believe Trump would do this
Comment 118.1	This is a new low for President Trump.  Shame on him.
Comment119	Why Muslims has to suffer every where....? Every state city country???? Huh
Comment120	Islam is not the problem here. Lack of money and education is. But yeah, blame Islam, it&#39;s easier and more straightforward.. Convenient for your small brains which are becoming smaller each day thanks to your media.
Comment 120.1	@Esas Çocuk as islam means &quot;submission&quot; these people have what is probably the worst starting point possible...as they live in predominantly muslim areas they are responsible for their own &quot;environment&quot;.
Comment 120.2	Wow thank you finally someone in these comment who actually has a brain
Comment 120.3	@john hansberry I am talking about the actual secular muslim countries (said actual cuz nigeria is considered one apparently) for a healthy comparison since there are not any non-secular christian (or any other religion) countries today. See, my point is that religion isn&#39;t the problem. People and the environment they live in are. Any religion can be easily manipulated to bring peace or oppression or chaos according to who manipulates it and why.
Comment 120.4	@Esas Çocuk are you attempting to reference a &quot;more developed&quot; islamic country?... it&#39;s not clear...but if you mean islam in a western country...well, muslims in western countries mostly fail to &quot;shape&quot; islamic ideologies to be able to live in the freedom of western countries.
Comment 120.5	@john hansberry ideologies don&#39;t shape people, people shape ideologies. Islam in nigeria is not islam in more developed countries. Or, christianity 500 years ago is not the christianity today.
Comment121	How long does it take a Muslim woman to take out the trash ???<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />9 months
Comment 121.1	<b>How long did it take your momma to take out her trash???</b><br /><br /><br /><br />&lt; 9 months. Cuz she couldn&#39;t wait to expel her toxic waste product. ☣☢
Comment 121.2	@Mean Old Lady <br /><br />Extreme Islamists are far-right,  just flying a different flag.<br /><br />There&#39;s nothing socialist or liberal about Abrahamic religions. <br /><br />So, you knew you were lying when you posted your remark.<br /><br />I just wanted to point out how ridiculous you appear.<br /><br />No wonder you troll, you have nothing worthwhile to say.
Comment 121.3	@Bongo Frenzy - And like islam, the only thing the left has to offer the world is deception &amp; murder, which is why the left &amp; islam go hand in totalitarian hand.
Comment 121.4	"@greathey1234 this is what imams do to boys <a href=""https://m.khaleejtimes.com/news/crime-and-courts/imam-rapes-12-year-old-boy-nine-times-in-uae"">https://m.khaleejtimes.com/news/crime-and-courts/imam-rapes-12-year-old-boy-nine-times-in-uae</a>"

Comment 124.1	Because they don&#39;t and never have liked the truth 💩💩💩
Comment 124.2	@Bongo Frenzy because this one doesnt involve taking about average IQ among Africans.... 🙄
Comment 124.3	so how come your comment is here?
Comment125	Islam is terrible. Their prophet pedophile Muhammad normalized degrading the lives of those who didn&#39;t accept his ideology.
Comment126	Other than natural disasters, Islam is destroying the world.
Comment 126.1	@Fahad Malik Mention which Muslim country that don&#39;t have terrorist
Comment 126.2	If you look at the colours. <br /><br />1 - Choose what each colour represents. <br /><br />1 - Whether it is emotion or anything else. <br /><br />2 - Now compare what those colours are. And decide what is best for you. But do not get overwhelmed. *<br />3 - Follow what is right by you. Never hate your self. Move forward upon your own justice.<br /><br />Btw Rainbow flag cannot represent  LGBTQI because you cannot change colours. In my view it represents the colours of the countries and emotions of the world.<br /> This is my view. But you can still use the flag within the LGBTQI for it is your choice.<br /><br />This life is a test. Such is the fact as Muslims to do somethikng then say Allah chose for this to happen is wrong. And an abuse of what Allah is. <br /><br />What I am saying is to notice the differences of idiots who follow Islam but do not follow the religion.<br /><br />Peace from a Pakistani Muslim in the UK 🇬🇧🇵🇰
Comment 126.3	@Good Place support the divide and conquer? That will only put humans into more us VS them situations.
Comment 126.4	The world might be better if we supported every religion.
Comment127	We can only hope Africans get better educations so they can be free of the Jewish god Yahweh and all the misery this god brings the world.
Comment128	Islam = Peace<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />kidding on 🤣.
Comment 128.1	@Zainab Khalifah - Because islam is a totalitarian ideology that commands its cultists to rape &amp; murder in the name of a pagan deity with Satanic origins.
Comment 128.2	@spf_fishing Oh,thank you for that assessment Mr and those who understand would get what I mean.
Comment 128.3	Good Place that fact you think it&#39;s not funny makes it even funnier, thank you 😂.
Comment 128.4	@Zainab Khalifah Why can&#39;t you realise the problem with Islam. <br />A pedophile who ordered to kill people for silly reasons.
Comment 128.5	That was not funny.
Comment129	The so called religion of peace. Islam is a religion of hate and division
Comment130	Remember Islam is the religion of Peace (Note to BBC: we now need at least half a dozen pieces with cute kids in hijabs playing football or reciting nursery rhymes in English, so we don&#39;t forget the narrative).
Comment 130.1	These are the lucky ones. Don&#39;t even ask what happened to the women and girls!
Comment131	Why is this news? There are more than 9 million slaves in Africa Today 2019 &amp; more every year before that. Why did BBC never report on them? Or any other main stream media for that matter.
Comment 131.1	Cornelis van der Heijden this is propaganda Nigeria’s Army just kick out many western NGOs for secretly aiding boko harem and the Uk wanted to help with investigation but Nigeria Declined their help.
Comment 131.2	@Mean Old Lady I dont give a damn what you want to hear or not, I dont want to hear crap from an ignoramus like you but hey I read your comment. And it has been european countries that have been responsible for the most death and destruction in human history so stick your dumb ass opinion where the sun dont shine
Comment 131.3	@Amir Shehu - I don&#39;t want to hear crap from a muslim whose only card to play is the victim card despite being the large cult of mass murderers the world has ever known.
Comment 131.4	BBC doesn&#39;t give a damn about anything that doesn&#39;t have a bucket of cash strapped to it.
Comment 131.5	@ThatBadGuy you dont have to pull the white card on every unrelated topic, it&#39;s okay... let it go... you&#39;re not a victim... it&#39;s okay

Comment135	Continue hiding behind Islam&#39;s name, continue brainwashing these people into thinking it&#39;s to do with Islam, people will believe anything nowadays.
Comment 135.1	You cannot force one into Islam! It is written within the Qur&#39;an!<br /><br />I told my sister. If you find Islam boring or do not like it. You do not have 2 follow it. <br /><br />She can do what ever she likes.

Comment 141.2	@Mean Old Lady <br /><br />You trolls are pathetic cowards.
Comment 141.3	@Dj Sponsor - Yeah, leftists.  Leftists are teachings kids mindless nihilism &amp; bending over backwards to appease bullies.<br />Then surprise pikachu face when kids get sick of being bullied &amp; no one doing anything about it, so they take extreme measures into their own hands.

Comment 143.1	@Hobba bobba and you sir are a reasonable person
Comment 143.2	@Amir Shehu true, I guess I don&#39;t feel the need to inject my own ideology into every scenario
Comment 143.3	@Hobba bobba because hes a disgruntled rightie
Comment 143.4	@aeiou no you fuck off
Comment 143.5	Nothing to do with the video but you had to inject your ideology because...
Comment144	This is set up to malign Islam because no madarasa does this anywhere in the world.
Comment 144.1	@john hansberry <br />No, it is the media. Media indoctrinate you with hate of islam, more frequently after 9/11. It&#39;s the truth, the way media uses words and presentations of their material on Islam blinds you to see the truth. Use rationalism to reach truth. Learn to look for sole and only for facts and truth out of facts in any matter, even from conflicting news, and you will realize your mistakes. Hope you understand brother.
Comment 144.2	islam &quot;maligns&quot; itself 24/7...it doesn&#39;t need any help in that way.
Comment 144.3	The government or army must have tested something they shouldn&#39;t have.
Comment145	This would be the norm under global Islam
Comment 145.1	🤣 Islam is peaceful 🤣 yeah, that’s why you see headless bodies, raped children, blown up bodies, destroyed cities, and beaten women in its wake......
Comment 145.2	@Darsh Mate it&#39;s the fastest growing religion in the world right now, not all people are retarded like you and they actually find the peace and love that Islam shares in the Qur&#39;an. 113/114 Chapters of the Qur&#39;an begin by saying that God is the most merficul not like a Greek god of war or something smh
Comment 145.3	@Jakaria Uddin Read it&#39;s interpretations? Really? This is how you get extremists.
Comment 145.4	Global China would be worse.
Comment 145.5	@Jakaria Uddin Stfu.   Islam is an evil cult.  Look hos much fucked up things ppl do in the name of that religion Islam.  You ppl are brain washed mental cases.
Comment146	They are abducting and trying to forcibly convert christians to islam. Islam is an evil political ideology. Islam is violent, wicked and cruel.
Comment147	I hear many good things about Nigeria so I am surprised to hear that this is happening there.
Comment 147.1	@Karezza Kenosis Says the 3rd light follower
Comment 147.2	@Troy Desole I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.
Comment 147.3	@Karezza Kenosis What do you mean by that ?.
Comment 147.4	You&#39;re at your best when you&#39;re unconscious.
Comment148	I really don’t get man’s barbarism to other men (and women). What pleasure do people get from this brutality? The guilt would haunt me forever.
Comment 148.1	Easy.. they get a testosterone high from seeing others suffer. They need to see others suffer to feel special. Perceived self importance raises testosterone levels, which are critically balanced, drastically. That&#39;s the kind of losers they are and they can be found all over the world in any grouping of people. However it is human and humane to feel compassion and honourable to live according to your compassion.<br />It is easy to tell the difference about people by observing whether they have compassion or disdain for others.
Comment149	They did the same thing to women and girls. History repeats itself.
Comment 149.1	@Mean Old Lady All you are is a the illusion of mist but accompanied by the instinct that this is weird or this is weird? <br /><br />Hence you will never stop even after death. For you are cursed beyond your reach!
Comment 149.2	@Mean Old Lady Adultery is forbidden. If you perform It you will get lashed. Simple. The same goes to rape! Do some research before you shout incompletely. <br /><br />Muhhamd Hijab does good debates as well as others in speakers corner in Hyde park. Search speakers corner and you will get thousands of debates about anything you can think of.<br /><br />And in Pakistan we had the world&#39;s first female president way before any of you. And we have the world&#39;s largest female workforce and military, air force as well as navy!
Comment150	It&#39;s ok to have slaves in Islam, no problem here.
Comment 150.1	@Yassine St You&#39;re called the Jewish broom, did you know that? You&#39;re like little worker ants lol.
Comment 150.2	@Yassine St How do you think the Africans got to the ports for the middle passage? Muslims brought them there. Muslims, doing what they do best, enslaving the kuffur.
Comment 150.3	@benbow7 that&#39;s me how low you iQ is

Comment152	BBC actually dared to show this? <br />How long before the BBC and David Lammy somehow blame the UK or Brexit for this?
Comment 152.1	@Amir ShehuGood, I don&#39;t want one. Clean Break baby!
Comment 152.2	@Kevin H no, its exactly in the position &#39;remoaners&#39; said it would be in if the people voted to leave. There is no getting a &#39;good deal&#39; with the EU.
Comment 152.3	Bongo Frenzy are you mad? Everyone that voted brexit still wants it delivered. It’s only in the ridiculous position it’s in because we had a remainer PM for three years sabotaging progress, and a parliament full of traitors that are willing to step in and thwart democracy at every opportunity.
Comment 152.4	&quot;every opinion I don&#39;t like is extreme right wing&quot; boop boop beep
Comment 152.5	is that the extreme right whining about how unpopular brexit has become due to it being such a destructive initiative of the extreme right wing?
Comment153	Lord help them Thank you In Jesus name amen.

Comment 153.5	@Khadr Trudeau She lied about that too.
Comment154	I&#39;m surprised they arnt missing any limbs, it&#39;s traditional in Islam to cut off one of a black persons limbs when you catch them stealing
Comment155	fakery in the name of islam
Comment156	Miss the Empire now
Comment 156.1	Only ones complaining about the British empire are the ones with a western passport. Helps when claiming welfare benefits.
Comment 156.2	The &quot;empire&quot; probably are the ones funding the Islamic schools.
Comment157	Now they say religion of peace has some exceptions
Comment 157.1	Here again with another uneducated idot who doesn&#39;t know a single thing about Islam and all he&#39;s good is getting brainwashed my the media and other people who are as stupid as him the same way the nazi brainwashed german people to hate the jews
Comment158	This is horrible. I&#39;m glad they are free.

Comment 159.1	@Ian Holloway That might be too difficult for the flat-Earther to do!

Comment160	YA ALLAH SELAMATKAN LAH MEREKA NI
Comment161	Blame the west???
Comment 161.1	@steven jimfield There are no facts, only interpretations.
Comment 161.2	@Karezza Kenosis The British Empire has nothing to do with this, and Trump definitely has nothing to do with this . It&#39;s religion based. So what are you aiming at?
Comment 161.3	@Karezza Kenosis I think you need to delete your sorry assed self.
Comment 161.4	@Karezza Kenosis 👈🏻🤡
