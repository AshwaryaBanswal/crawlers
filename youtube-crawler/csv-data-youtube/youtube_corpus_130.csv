Comment1	Dumbasses.
Comment2	Ahh,,,,what a difference a year makes. The only friends on this planet that the dup have are the Tories. The dup are anti-Labour, anti-SNP, anti-Lib Dems, anti-Irish, anti humanitarians, anti-Catholic, anti-American, anti-European, anti-human rites anti etc, etc, etc. What they are, are pro sectarian, pro anarchy, pro Monarchy, pro-capitalist (against the working and non-working classes) pro career politicians, pro-jobs for the boys, etc, etc, etc and so on and on. They are stuck in the 1600s. They are the bain of the ordinary working-class Loyalist people who are so desperately seeking a better life for their children. The DUP and their lackeys the Tories are doing absolutely nothing to help the working classes progress. In fact, they are consistently holding that group of British citizens, whom they so adamantly claim to be helping, in the poverty, they have been born into. Where do they stand today? At a cliff edge, staring disaster in the eye!. One can not get a better example of being stuck &quot;between a rock and a hard place&quot;. The only way they can go from here is almost certainly negative. If there was a general election in the morning, just take a moment to think about the possible outcomes,,, Labour gets a majority government. The dup are anti-Labour/Corbyn and will get thrown under the bus. The Tories get a majority? they really will be thrown under the bus (maybe, many buses?) as their ten votes would be null and void. A hung parliament? The best outcome for the dup. They could hold the balance of power and have great influence and so strengthen the Union. Well God damn it! that&#39;s what we already have and what benefit has the dup gained? Well, as fate would have it, they have put their beloved union in jeopardy and were thrown under the Boris bus. You couldn&#39;t make it up. Boris is a career politician, just like the dup members all are. Self-centred, only concerned with their own legacies at the expense of their constituents whom they claim to look after. They have dug their own graves. Their only friend on the planet has done them over. Need I say more?
Comment3	Britain has better working conditions that the rest of the EU now, so how can we be worse off by leaving. I think Labour are getting desperate and are just making up scare stories for the less intelligent to believe.
Comment4	Really YouTube, 5 days old news
Comment5	Yaaaawwwwnnnn!!!!!!!!
Comment6	That is they way Britain think about N-ireland, United ?, thinking about the Schottisch people ?, no way, it is only Brittania, and the deal was a former deal with May that was rejected, It is all a joke.
Comment7	The DUP Orange order and their various terror gangs are planning bedlam in the north of Ireland.  Get the all Ireland referendum and get nd all Ireland democracy that will put these bigots out of business once and for all. Tories should look at hitting the north&#39;s 9 billion handout if the dup and their ilk want to go down the road of dictatorship.
Comment8	Dup needs to fuck off
Comment9	DUP Flip flop on every issue . They are not to be trusted and i and many many others in our province will NEVER vote DUP again üò° üò° üò° üò° üò°<br />DUP ARE TOAST !!!!!
Comment10	That snap election was a big mistake.
Comment11	The DUP are a vile bunch of bigots , worthless pond scum the lot of them .
Comment12	Boris shafted the DUP and the DUP led by the nose in the belief that Boris would support the Union. With egg on their face Boris sold them a pup, protecting the interests of England, Scotland and Wales  and his own position. Everything seems to be heading to an All Ireland.  If this Brexit deal goes through the political careers of the DUP would appear to have ended. I doubt if any unionists would vote for them now! Next the Cash to Ash scandal and report. More egg on someones face!  Unionists have been sold out.. Unionist leaders led us to this point. Shame on them. Shame on untrustworthy Boris.  If the population were asked to vote again given the knowledge that they have now... would the vote change? Most definitely.
Comment13	Fuck the dup Fuck irelandüá©üá¨üá¨üáß
Comment14	DUP the last proper party left
Comment15	It&#39;s about time MPs listened to the people we voted to leave not like John major the gray the people did not vote for a no deal exit correct the people voted to leave full stop and this idiot with the glasses  wanting a new vote he didn&#39;t answer the question what if the vote does come out stay these idiots don&#39;t realise that the remainers who lost will do exactly what the labour party and the liberal democratic party are doing now and vote down every thing that a lame labour party wants as there is now way that in my opinion that labour will win a working majority let alone win the election if they think they could form a coalition party with the liberals in my opinion they will be hard pressed to find one in parliament as the leader and deputy of the liberals are a joke and have shot themselves in the foot and the longer they stay in parliament they will damage the liberal party to a point it may never come back from as for corbyn labour get a new leader!
Comment16	What are the terms of the new deal? and how can you have a deal if Northern Ireland doesn‚Äôt agree?
Comment17	If we had wanted to avoid bringing dodgy European ideology into the UK we should have started with pessimistic eternal-midnight Scandinavian Lutheranism, never mind the EU. In fact, I would throw the mediaeval Church on the pile also. What was wrong with the old Pagan gods? At least they had the good grace to respond to prayer occasionally.
Comment18	Translation the DUP will support the deal once they‚Äôve been paid again üôÑü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£
Comment 18.1	Exactly, we should never have given them the 2million in the first place.
Comment19	the tail wagging the dog
Comment20	No deal just get out but the bankers rule
Comment21	No,we don&#39;t want this,no we don&#39;t want that,no that won&#39;t do,no that won&#39;t work,piss off D.U.P and let the good unionists and republican party&#39;s run n.Ireland so people can get on with living.
Comment22	Boris should promise this Irish woman he will personally seek the driver of the bus that ran into her face.
Comment23	Does that mean the DUP want to remain?
Comment24	There are too many individual agendas for the government to get a majority too many individuals want different things; democracy in this country is dead, MPs are getting paid lots of money and benefits to play at wrecking the the lives of the majority who wanted out, get the deal done, in out, hard,soft, 1 years from now no one will give a damn about brexit...... get it done and get on with running the country.
Comment25	I have to admire Johnson&#39;s strategy. Ditch NI so it is easy to have a no deal during the transition. Also allows trade deal with Trump as it will please the American Irish lobby. Fatigued remain MPs who don&#39;t want no deal vote for his deal. Brexiteer MPs vote for his deal knowing there will be no deal down the road. Covers all bases. Very clever.
Comment26	"Boris KNOWS this &quot;deal&quot; will never pass in Parliament.... <br />he is just setting the stage hoping for a NO DEAL BREXIT at the deadline....<br /><br />WHICH IS WHAT HE HAS ALWAYS WANTED SINCE DAY 1 of Brexit vote passing in the UK, 3.5 yrs ago."
Comment27	The correspondent gave Owen Smith more real information about the deal than he gave her.
Comment28	Arlene Foster looks like Ricky Hatton after 10 rounds!!
Comment 28.1	I think that she has BALLS!. BIG HAIRY ONES, ROTTEN.
Comment29	The commons will not agree on it. Its a NO deal
Comment30	NO DEAL. WTO
Comment31	the YooKaai is in turmoiiiilll ,ahhahahhaaa :))))<br />fecceeee
Comment32	DUP can not help with the core of the matters that has forced England to hav to work more with distant partners
Comment33	DUP only when I have had a drink.
Comment34	Boris is Fecked ....Big Celebrations on Saturday night .....‚úãüèºü§öüèº
Comment35	Those same scientists and experts did predict the collapse of the UK straight after the referendum if the people voted to leave. It didn‚Äôt happen.<br />Why don‚Äôt you understand that the UK success in every field is the result of the hard work of its people not the EU?
Comment36	To suggest &#39;putting back to the people&#39; that which the people have already decided upon is a statement of thee most sinister nature.
Comment37	The people want Brexit.
Comment38	DUP are the only patriots left. Sellout deal by a sellout party.
Comment 38.1	well said
Comment 38.2	Wise up
Comment39	Ireland will never be free.... Once force into this May&#39;s deal in Drag
Comment 39.1	Ask any English person and they will say,get rid of northern Ireland! .BUT I bet that the Catholics in the north don&#39;t really want to leave because of all the benefits that they will miss out on ?.
Comment40	Why are the EU smiling ? What‚Äôs in this for them ?  - sounds like brexit in name only or maybot 2 .
Comment41	Where is Noel Edmonds ?
Comment42	Probably around a million and a half people have died since the first referendum. How are you going to ask them whether they have in fact changed their minds now? And the predominantly younger remain voters who will now be eligible to vote, who were not eligible to vote in 2016, will their votes be excluded? And for those people who were thinking &quot;we will just exit by default on october 31&quot;... you have short memories.. we were all thinking the exact same thing last time around when Theresa May announced in the very last minute &quot;actually, we didn&#39;t leave at all.&quot;
Comment43	the problem is there is still remainers , and more than likely thanks to DUP or Dumb or whatever it will be rejected he we go again, this country will not move on,  it&#39;s really messed up  with Ireland , and it&#39;s even more messed up they can hold the future of the UK,
Comment44	It&#39;s all smoke, mirrors and bluster. This so called deal is 95% May&#39;s disgraceful surrender deal.
Comment 44.1	@Ron Patterson But won&#39;t NI have access to both the UK market and the single market(largest trading block in the world), it&#39;s the deal that Scotland are begging for but can&#39;t get.
Comment 44.2	@Chris Spelman Worse than the May Deal... VAT now tied with Republic. If UK reduce VAT tax on anything, we Northern Ireland do not benefit. Vat in republic much higher than UK. Northern Ireland have been screwed over. Total sell out by UK Government. Basically the mainland want rid of us and its showing.
Comment 44.3	It&#39;s closer to the original deal the EU proposed before May had to pander to the DUP
Comment45	The DUP will only toe the line if they are paid, a lot!
Comment46	Brexit now. EU is a jail.<br />Backstop is a joke. A fake problem.
Comment47	Well the media did all they could for 3yrs to ruin leaving . Rember trump had no chance of winning but was a landslide victory. Theres more that want out now than before. Why?  Because the EU shown its true colors.
Comment48	Get your cheque book out Boris. That&#39;s the only &#39;compromise&#39; the DUP understand.
Comment49	No deal. Just leave.
Comment50	dont support them this deal is just mays deal rehashed
Comment51	We are such a stupid Kingdom - on all sides.
Comment 51.1	saladdogger - totally agree. I‚Äôm actually in favour of brexit. I just assumed that all parties would work together to try to do it in a fair manner that benefitted the country in the long-term.
Comment 51.2	D  fair point but the trouble is the EU has gone well beyond what it used to be - a common market and is now close to being a superstate .
Comment 51.3	saladdogger - the thing is that there are legitimate problems with the EU (eg lack of judiciary autonomy) but obviously also great benefits.  The idiocy is that both sides can‚Äôt see each other‚Äôs good points to work together.
Comment 51.4	D   Looks that way to be honest but I‚Äôm not sure that if remain had won any of this would be happening . Same in America if trump had lost the election no way the republicans would be behaving like the left .
Comment 51.5	saladdogger - In the past we could get our acts together for the national good despite our differences.  Now self interest reigns supreme for all sides.
Comment52	Look..just give England its Brexit...that&#39;s what the hard right tory brexiteers want...and give Scotland its independence and Northern and southern reunification..because that will be the end result..maybe take a little time but it&#39;s coming.
Comment 52.1	increase the medication
Comment53	So it will be no deal, on the 31st then.  Good enough.
Comment 53.1	roylynn wall 31st of when is the question!
Comment54	fecking  Irish!
Comment55	Oh Teresa. Why did you call that snap election? You had a big majority and we wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation.
Comment 55.1	Absolutely.
Comment56	Voting for a second referendum is treason against the people and the poles say 54% wants out and we are still in due to the MPs not the people
Comment57	Good thing Theresa May had the sense to wait until after a deal was done before paying the DUP their bribe..........<br /><br /><br />Then again she&#39;s the arrogant idiot that assumed she&#39;d be winning that election or that starting the exit process before negotiations had even started was a good idea.
Comment58	If the DUP stops this deal, we should seek a new referendum for a united Ireland and rid ourselves of these trouble makers.
Comment 58.1	Gross Herman   how would the DUP stop this deal with 10 votes ?.
Comment59	Good dont support it 3 years may 3 weeks johnstone my arse üòÇüòÇüòÇüëäüëä get these traitors out of that shithole workingvfor the royal peados not the people
Comment60	Take the No Deal
Comment61	Labour party is stupid and should be buried
Comment62	Ireland for the Irish. Loyal to the queen.....out!!!
Comment63	The Labor Party quite frequently when they don&#39;t like the outcome of the will of the Peoples tries to move the goal posts and start over instead of implementing the choice of the UK peoples. They vote against a vote of the People then two weeks later say they support a vote.
Comment64	What a treat it was this morning,to wake up to Charl and Nadger at Westminster,without those monstrous EU flags and banners waved in our faces...and without that monotonous idiots voice,baying ‚Äústaaaap Brexit!‚Äù
Comment65	–ö–∞–∫ –≤—ã –±—ã–ª–∏ —à—Ç–æ–ø–∞–Ω—ã–º–∏ –ø—Ä–µ–∑–µ—Ä–≤–∞—Ç–∏–≤–∞–º–∏  - —Ç–∞–∫ –≤—ã –∏–º–∏ –∏ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏—Å—å! –ü–æ–∑–¥—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è—é!!! ü§£ü§£ü§£üñêÔ∏è
Comment 65.1	But we do not want to stay.
Comment66	... bbc ... agency of jokers ...
Comment67	What is the deal. EU still wants UK to pay them 39 Billion and they, the EU still make the rules. Goodness a great nation as the British allowed others to govern them like this is unbelievable. Hitler is laughing from his grave for many years now.
Comment68	DUP will do anything to STUFF UP the U.K. leaving! The day Eng er Land gets rid of Sco/NI/Wal the better, these minorities want to rule Eng er Land, really???? Just let them GO once and for all. PS Build a frigging WALL between SCO and ENG.
Comment69	forget north Ireland! LEAVE MEANS LEAVE!<br />STRONGER SOVIEGN UK WITHOUT NI!
Comment70	Are the NI Unionists the Kurds of the English? Useful idiots on a good day and collateral damage on a bad?
Comment71	Owen Smith, before you talk about a new referendum, how about you deliver on the first one?<br />What&#39;s that Owen? you didn&#39;t like the result of the referendum so you want to defy the will of the people and ignore it..... but you will respect the result of another referendum (if it goes your way).<br /><b>You have just shoved democracy up your arse</b> - <b>not delivering the Ist referendum invalidates all future referendums</b> - don&#39;t you get it? ignore one referendum, ignore them all, because you will make referendums useless. The government is OBLIGED to follow the referendum result - whether you like it or not, Do your damn job!
Comment72	Lying Labour scumbug! Body language: raised eyebrows and furrowed brow is a very clear &quot;show&quot; of both lying and not believing what the person is saying. We had our vote. We voted LEAVE, so shut up and get on with it.
Comment73	Can&#39;t they just tell the DUP to stfu and sit down?
Comment74	the need for new deals was obvioiusly intrinsic to leaving!<br />once out of the eu system any trade with them would need new arrangements.
Comment75	Will Scotland and Wales ask for the same statut NI has ?
Comment 75.1	Yes please.   Let them go their way.
Comment76	Brexit was done to kill EU will finally kill UK :)
Comment77	grab popcorn and watching season finale
Comment78	Well done DUP! Let‚Äôs get a clean break from these globalist destroyers of Europe.
Comment 78.1	Nah the DUP is retarded
Comment79	We do not want another Referendum we had one we voted to leave, it&#39;s your job as MP&#39;s to vote for the deal so vote it&#39;s 1 of 2 outcomes vote for the deal or we leave without a deal simple really.
Comment80	This is worse than May‚Äôs deal, and betrays Brexit.
Comment 80.1	It&#39;s the same deal different name
Comment81	How many referendums does Labour want? &quot;Let&#39;s keep voting until we win&quot;.
Comment 81.1	@Andrew_Simpson Depictions <br /><br />Why are you so pathetic?
Comment 81.2	@Arfur Fuxxakes Well it&#39;s good that you recognize your own shortcomings and the error of your ways.  But please don&#39;t reproach yourself too much.  To be honest I think you should put yourself forward for the Labour front bench - I can see you being a hit alongside the likes of Angela Rayner and Rebecca Long-Bailey.
Comment 81.3	@Andrew_Simpson Depictions <br /><br />I read what you spewed and totally disagreed with it.<br /><br />Don&#39;t blame the reader for the lack of sensible content from the writer.
Comment 81.4	@Arfur Fuxxakes Labour - a party for whom I have voted for more than any other but I now find totally unelectable are trying to angle any situation possible to get their hands on the levers of power.  No part of Labour&#39;s position involves leaving the EU.  Unfortunately quoting the same accusation about taking part in a democratic process which I levied against you falls short of demonstrating a cogent  understanding of the political position.  Perhaps, and this is just a suggestion, you might make further progress in debate if you took a little time to read what other commentators are actually saying.
Comment 81.5	That&#39;s the exact tactics the EU used on Ireland years ago. They kept on until they managed to fiddle a win. The same thing will happen here.
Comment82	Labour are a joke we voted leave now get us out deal or no deal
Comment 82.1	@Ash Rowland mufc <br /><br />By the way.<br /><br />You call me weak yet thanks to my Union I have had payrises.<br /><br />You are the weak one because you stand alone and haven&#39;t had any payrises.<br /><br />Can you see who is the weak one out of the two of us?<br /><br />Not an insult,  just an observation. <br /><br />You&#39;ve done nothing to stand up for yourself,  that&#39;s your weakness, no-one else&#39;s.
Comment 82.2	Oh dear.<br /><br />You&#39;re in denial. <br /><br />Good luck with your project. <br /><br />When you are worse off, be proud of the fact that you CHOSE to be worse off. <br /><br />Those people you hate are trying to help you.<br /><br />But you&#39;re beyond help.<br /><br />You really think you&#39;re going to be better off?<br /><br />When was the last time a Tory improved your life?<br /><br />ps You say you can find anything on the internet, ok, find a link that says that there are too many lorry drivers in the UK and that&#39;s why you haven&#39;t had a payrise. <br /><br />I&#39;ll bet you cant. <br /><br />Instead of blaming other drivers,  why is your employer using cheap labour to undercut you?<br /><br />Nothing to do with the EU,  everything to do with your boss.<br /><br />He&#39;s got a better house, better car and has had payrises, you&#39;re being used and blaming the wrong people. <br /><br />He must be pissing himself laughing at you.
Comment 82.3	"If the government were truly trying to stop Freedom of Movement why are they allowing five times as many immigrants from non-EU countries, that we don&#39;t have to let in at all?<br /><br />Your Polish immigrants will merely be replaced by Asian and African immigrants instead. <br /><br /><a href=""https://fullfact.org/immigration/eu-migration-and-uk/"">https://fullfact.org/immigration/eu-migration-and-uk/</a><br /><br />Good luck!"
Comment 82.4	@Arfur Fuxxakes I can find articles off the internet that favour leave but I won&#39;t as im not going to argue with a sore losing reaminer. all im doing is voting for a party that will get us out the eu deal or no deal so we can move on to bigger things good day to you üëåüëç
Comment 82.5	"@Ash Rowland mufc <br /><br />No need to use insults just because you have no facts.<br /><br />The UK has a HGV driver shortage of 50,000 drivers, so how can you claim that your wages are kept low by EU workers?<br /><br />It is kept low by employers. <br /><br />Which union are you in that is fighting for your payrise? <br /><br />When have you and your fellow drivers withheld your labour in order to get a payrise? <br /><br />If you don&#39;t demand better money,  you&#39;re not going to get offered it just because employers are nice people. <br /><br /><a href=""https://assetalliancegroup.co.uk/2019/06/01/the-hgv-driver-shortage-new-industry-facts-and-perspectives/"">https://assetalliancegroup.co.uk/2019/06/01/the-hgv-driver-shortage-new-industry-facts-and-perspectives/</a><br /><br />Focus, don&#39;t just accept lies.<br /><br />Boris has moved Workers Rights from compulsory to voluntary,  do you think he did that because he wants you to be better off?<br /><br />Wake up."
Comment83	BBC just loves to interview these REMOANER SCUMBAGS, BUT never calls them out on their bias. Just listen to this Labour SLIME Owen Smith, it makes you want to throw up.
Comment84	"Stop <a href=""http://fighting.you/"">fighting.you</a> been bullied by gamblers and casino losers. They are  taking revange on you.dont trade in doller.try local or trade without currency."
Comment85	Sorry UK from the US. I hope y‚Äôall get ur sovereignty back.
Comment 85.1	Anson T thank you
Comment 85.2	Hi Anson,  too many UK politicians and op-ed writers have takes SOROS&#39;s dirty money.
Comment86	Must be a Bad deal because the Horrible Letwin supports it
Comment87	Johnson&#39;s surrender bill
Comment88	its nothing like leave and any referendum without leave on it will cause a civil - civil war
Comment 88.1	No, threats of violence will not be allowed to undermine our democracy. <br /><br />Your threats of terrorism only damage your own cause.
Comment89	Fuck boris   nobody listens to him
Comment90	Wank head lefty remoaner
Comment91	The natural inclination of politicians is to avoid a close vote since nearly half of your constituents will criticize. So if there was no way Mays&#39; plan could pass as long as delay was an option. If indeed there is no delay option then Johnson&#39;s deal may well pass.  The antisemitic Corbyn has fractured Labour to the point that Johnson has a good chance of peeling off enough votes to outweigh the loss of the DUP. There is no question the latest deal screws Northern Ireland worse than May&#39;s deal but no one cares. If the Johnson plan passes the DUP will have a lot pf &#39;splainin to do after years of sucking up to the Tories.
Comment92	Labour Party is well and truly finished, and if the dup carry on with there antics, will be to, anyway the BBC and sky are a remainer disgrace
Comment93	Dup give this country a help please..and get us out
Comment94	Am I right in saying that a party who doesn&#39;t sit down at stormont has a deciding factor on whether Boris Johnstons deal is approved or not?<br />The vote in the beginning should have held a separate paragraph concerning Northern Ireland and allowed the people of ulster a border poll. <br />If NI stays in an EU customs union, then let it be reidentified and funded by the EU not London.
Comment95	The deal appears to be a rehash of the Theresa May Treaty, without a backstop.<br />On that basis, I don‚Äôt believe it will get through Parliament. That means exiting without a deal, which is my recommendation, entirely based upon the track record of this Parliament and the current Government. Well do you trust any of them? I don‚Äôt. <br />The answer therefore,  must be a General Election, then clear out these failed liars and treasonous collaborators. With a clear the swamp election it will then be onwards and upwards for everyone.
Comment96	Labour: &quot;we will also respect the referendum result&quot; <br />also Labour: &quot;we want a second referendum&quot;
Comment 96.1	@k r <br /><br />Yes, Brexit is damaging. <br /><br />Everyone promoting leave has said it will have adverse effects on our economy, including Rees-Mogg and Farage. <br /><br />Do you deny it?
Comment 96.2	@Arfur Fuxxakes you were saying &quot;brexit is so damaging&quot;
Comment 96.3	@k r <br /><br />Me neither, I couldn&#39;t give a damn whether we leave or not.<br /><br />The workers will get screwed as always. <br /><br />I&#39;m not sure what point you are trying to make.
Comment 96.4	@Arfur Fuxxakes i am not having leave vs remain debate
Comment 96.5	@k r <br /><br />I didn&#39;t say Labour are blocking no-deal, MP&#39;s of all parties are blocking it because it&#39;s so damaging. <br /><br />Brexit is self-harm, Boris doesn&#39;t care whether we stay or leave, he just wants to claim it&#39;s everyone else&#39;s fault it hasn&#39;t happened. <br /><br />So he can win a General Election.
Comment97	DUP a soft border is good because it really does make it easier for a United Ireland further down the line when your population majority inexorably changes to be non-unionist.
Comment 97.1	You&#39;re not wrong there pet !
Comment 97.2	and all england has to become muslim,see we both can see the future
Comment98	Darlene&#39;s gonna send in the B Specials and Black and Tans to Parliament.
Comment 98.1	No need to bother. The jihadis will take Westminster and Brussels and there&#39;ll be nothing left to come out of. It&#39;s called reaping the whirlwind.
Comment99	DUP, I think you&#39;ve been DUPED, of course Leo, Boris and their European companions are all laughing at you fools behind your backs. You&#39;re not big or intelligent ¬†enough to take on Europe, the Irish government nor the influence of Irish America who are long established in US politics and whom have made quite explicit comments that any interference to the Good Friday Accord shall not be tolerated.¬†One more thing DUP, I&#39;m English and neither myself nor my companions want you involved in our Nation so you guys live in peace in your country and leave us Brits to our country. Good luck Eire.
Comment 99.1	But the DUP do seem to have enough influence in the HoC to block any Withdrawal Agreement that they are not happy with. It was always going to be a very dangerous policy for any UK government to allow the DUP to hold so much influence within the HoC. Northern Ireland is part of the UK whether you like it or not and it will remain part of the UK for a long time to come. The UK contribute ¬£10bn pa to keep NI afloat. But in return for this money, you get the DUP influencing UK domestic and foreign policy - well worth every penny.
Comment100	Lets hope that the DUP do not back the deal at any price
Comment101	The DUP looked happy with Boris not long ago when he was talking to them not long ago.They even promoted him up there in the north Ireland. He surely told them things they wanted to.know and possibly reassured them....Then what happened then??  We Boris just stubbed them in the back and walked away as the EU offered him something else more interesting. <br /><br />This is how Boris work he will promise you what will make you give him something. ..As soon as  he get it he will do the runner. What he promised you is simply illusions ,lies and tricks.<br /> <br />350 millions p/w NHS ..Brexit Norway style. He got Brexit with his tricks and lies. The EU now specially the Irish are bending over for him..very strange indeed.
Comment 101.1	@Gabriel Kelly Yes I know .they gave him worse bits...which is  infact worse.<br />Bending yes they did. As they gave him the bad stuff he  wanted..They know very well that by offering him this it  will do 2  things for the EU.<br />A. The EU will not be blamed for a no deal. Because they did now allow Boris to get some bits.<br /><br />B. The EU  probably believes by worsening May&#39;s deal this will more likely be a no pass.  and the possibility of softer Brexit deal in future or no Brexit maybe  possible.
Comment 101.2	The Irish &amp; EU are bending over for BoJo? They took BoJo for a mug and sent him packing with a worse deal than they gave May - how is that bending over lol. They had BoJo by the short and curly&#39;s and they squeezed him for everything they could. They gave him the deal knowing that he would lose in the HoC,  he cant get a no-deal so the odds of brexit not happening at all has just increased in the last 24 hours. This is a bad spot for BoJo and the EU know it lol.
Comment102	Dup is duping again.
Comment103	The remain crowd doesn&#39;t care what the deal looks like, they will vote against it.  And as always, the bottom line is that they don&#39;t care about democratic votes of the people.
Comment 103.1	@Du≈°an Xmetov Well yes but that is always the case with regard to a country to which one wishes to export is it not ?  If the UK wishes to export to India the goods must conform to Indian standards - but only those companies that export to India need worry about them.  At present all companies need to comply on all goods they produce.  If you only export to India that&#39;s a pain in the arse.
Comment 103.2	@Andrew_Simpson Depictions But it isn&#39;t, and if the UK will want a free trade agreement with the EU after a brexit (even a no-deal one), they&#39;ll still need compatible regulations, with the only difference now being a lack of being able to vote on them, since you&#39;ll no longer have MEPs, and members of the european commission from your country.
Comment 103.3	Yes - if EU policy was to slaughter every second born child the idiot remainers would still trot along and support it
Comment104	We never voted for a deal we voted to leave the EU
Comment 104.1	Wow you&#39;re ignorant.
Comment105	I am not surprised. The Northern Irish political DUP -mafia wants to blackmail more protection rackets from Her Majesty¬¥s Government and Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Believe me, if Boris and his Tory gang in Westminster, London,¬†are willing to pay enough¬†for Northern Ireland, DUP will surely support the new Brexit deal with the EU, period.
Comment106	It&#39;s a shit deal, but leaving the EU was a shit idea, so not sure what people were expecting.
Comment107	It&#39;s hard to have any sympathy for the d u p.<br />The d in their name should be for duplicity and not democratic.<br />When small dogs forget they are just that, they get mauled by bigger ones.<br />And even the dogs in the street new this was going to happen to the d u p, they are a busted flush they alienated all moderate opinion by putting the link with Britain above the jobs and prosperity of the people in the Colony
Comment 107.1	Ah, so say the typical Irish republican bigot. Hates everything British but love the IRA murderers of women and children.
Comment108	Given the complexities of Brexit and N.Ireland, there&#39;s no way the opinion of a minority extremist party like the DUP should ever be allowed to be relevant.
Comment 108.1	Hey dickhead. DUP are not a minority or extremist. Stop talking shite about DUP. You know nothing jerk
Comment109	About time the the rest of the UK had thrown the DUP/Unionists under the Bus they have always been the Stumbling block to Brexit
Comment 109.1	Hey dickhead. We are the ones trying to ensure a proper Brexit.
Comment110	DUP thrown off the bus,by the conductor - that being large corporations that back the Conservative party meanwhile the bus driver - EU,is still keeping an eye on passenger UK.<br />Folks the demographics in NI is such that it is only going one way into the future,at that stage Ireland may have to deal with the fallout this time round.
Comment111	What a goose
Comment112	Brits will lose jobs, huge wages cut, failed economy, lthere will be suffering and hardship. Blah blah blah. Same old rhetoric from the remainers and corbyns pro Islamic anti Britain bull shit
Comment113	Thirty three billion to leave.please come forward Nigel.We must have a General election not another referendum  for us who have had enough of this crap to sort it once and for all.
Comment114	Just started to watch Question Time and is the same old BBC so turned it off.
Comment 114.1	Remoaners are sitting reading your comment and thinking &#39;yeah BBC is so pro Brexit - they never let the remain side of the argument see the light of day&#39;.
Comment115	Boris Johnson should tell the DUP that they should back the deal without the backstop because chances are that it will get through parliament on Saturday with or without them and if they don&#39;t back the deal he will take back the one billion pounds foster charged for their support
Comment 115.1	Take it back. I haven&#39;t seen any of it and likely never will. Fuck your deal.
Comment116	If it passes its the end of the tory party
Comment 116.1	Hope so.
Comment117	Remain are delusional... Otherwise they wouldn&#39;t run to court to make a law to cancel one...
Comment118	I do wish the BBC did an investigation into the current state of the EU. Spain is dealing with an attempted break away province, France is having the Yellow Vest riots, Germany is having a rash of right wing then anti right wing protests, Sweden is having an up-tic in bombings, though they are having their media relabel such, and I am sure there are more that I am not aware of in other EU countries. One must remember that the Allies and Finland were the only reason that Stalin didn&#39;t go forth with his desire to concur Europe. Ukraine was up for NATO/OTAN membership, but was invaded by Russia. Finland was entering negotiations to join the treaty, but a stern threat was issued by Putin, so that ended. Now the UK is leaving the EU, Why would this help the Russians? Anything to shake the cohesion of the NATO/OTAN union would help. Also, having an American president so deeply in debt to them, making the US more or less a Vichy state, who withdrew from Syria so that Russia and Turkey could exert military force. This gives Russia a bit of sway and influence with another NATO ally.
Comment 118.1	@Dixie Normous On broadcast TV, more than one of his sons assured the interviewer that since no sane banking institution would lend to Trump related enterprises, all the money came from Russia.
Comment 118.2	Stop watching CNN and MSNBC. How is Trump in debt to Russia?
Comment119	The Second Referendum should be done ‚úÖ again long time ago and people should be told how bad it can look for üá¨üáß in the next 100 years ‚úåüèª Family is Everything and some politicians forgot that and please remember Karma will find you even if you become Homeless because the amount of stress you put on hard working people is not acceptable ‚òùüèøüêï enjoy life and I hope everyone&#39;s dreams come true üååüëçüêïüêïüåàüôè you don&#39;t break a Family but some of you politicians are not very bright and you brainwash people that voted and trusted you so you might not care what they think of you but believe me you should be interested what Gods are thinking of you and if you want to see Hell on this beautiful planet I will know on your door üö™ but hopefully your senses come back and some of you won&#39;t have to go through Hell but everyone will go straight to Heaven üåå‚úåüèª‚ù§Ô∏è‚òùüèø peace and love ‚ù§Ô∏è
Comment 119.1	@Dixie Normous Yeah he normally drinks Top Deck but he stumbled on a can of Skol
Comment 119.2	That must be some good shit you are you smoking. Now toddle off to bed and sleep it off.
Comment120	Millions of people voted in the uk referendum ...we are .on the verge of a historical deal....then to think it is being put in jeaperdy   by a few horrible bigoted dinasaurs from northern Ireland.....sickening...
Comment 120.1	Suck the back of them.
Comment 120.2	Well yes - and whichever way people voted surely we cannot go on like this - and before any remoaners reading this think staying in the EU is an option I can confirm that it isn&#39;t.
Comment121	So the DUP seems dead set on Northern Ireland returning to a place of revolt and grief by standing in the way of the only type of solution that can work here short of the northern irish not acting like tempestuous children with explosives.  But its not just the DUP, but Labour and whomever else votes against it this coming weekend in the UK Parliament.  At this very late stage about 2 weeks left till the brexit date there are two options and only 2 options it appears: 1) Leave under the terms of this newest deal (which would prevent a hard customs border being set up between Ireland and Northern Ireland, or 2) Leave under the default (no deal) which will require a hard customs border all along the Ireland/Northern Ireland border.  The odds of the EU approving another extensions IF the PM goes back next week if the deal is rejected in the Commons, are low if you believe the talking heads.  So regardless of whether UK law requires the PM to ask for an extension and he does so, the EU is under no obligation to grant it, yet again, unless there is a clear sign that the UK government was on its way to getting past this Commons logjam it has been in for 3+ years on this issue.<br />But a party or minority or even majority in Northern Ireland won&#39;t get the right to change things around at will going forward independent of the EU/UK.  That political situation is a nonstarter.<br /><br />But in the end this is the case: under brexit Ireland will be in the EU, and Northern Ireland will be outside the EU, so they are in effectively two different customs zones, and as such there has to be a customs border between them.  Or the customs border is, as in the prior &#39;deal&#39; and this new &#39;deal, between the island of Ireland and the island of Britain with N.I remaining for many things inside the EU customs union.  But this isn&#39;t Schr√∂dingers cat here,  Northern Ireland cannot be both in the EU and not in the EU at the same time.  Pick one.  Then deal with the consequences of your choice.  And if you choose some of the options, the folks in Northern Ireland that cannot behave as adults appear to be threatening to commit acts of violence again.  And that will be something for the UK to then deal with.
Comment122	No 3rd referendum. We have already ahd the 2nd
Comment123	DUP can be bought with few billions.
Comment 123.1	Foodways Distribution  Ian Paisley junior is much cheaper than that - nice holiday and he‚Äôs anybody‚Äôs
Comment 123.2	Have we offered them some spuds ?
Comment124	I think this is Boris&#39; plan all along.<br /><br /><br />Put on the table an undesirable deal that benefits no one, and the DUP along with the opposition will vote against it. Juncker ruled out a further Brexit extension and by default, Britain leaves on 31st October with no deal.<br /><br /><br />Parliament has two options on Saturday; either that deal or no deal.
Comment125	Please hand your ¬£10B back DUP
Comment126	If Labour dont like it it must be a worthwhile deal.  Its the deal or WTO Brexit.  I am happy with either.  Lats just get the F**K on with leaving. Out on the 31st with or without a deal.
Comment 126.1	Tony Hind you idiot it‚Äôs not a deal it‚Äôs a treaty you need to educate yourself b4 saying just get on with it. If your that fed up of the Brexit scenario stop watching it then you fool
Comment 126.2	You got my vote !
Comment127	Absolute denial from all governments involved, none of these idiots will be in the house after the next election, nobody will vote for them,  LEAVE means LEAVE you morons.
Comment128	it looks like boris is going to have to offer another bung to the dup to get their support - at the british taxpayers expense of course.<br />a complete sell out by the tories; i doubt if theresa may will vote for  this deal.<br />the labour party&#39;s brexit proposal will appeal more  to both the eu &amp; the british electorate.<br />johnson&#39;s days are  numbered.
Comment129	DUP are screwed it&#39;s going to a people&#39;s vote and only 600.000 people in the North of Ireland are British
Comment 129.1	@Andrew_Simpson Depictions it&#39;s a shit show man don&#39;t be surprised if it will go to another vote
Comment 129.2	I could be mistaken but I could have sworn you know that the 2016 referendum was open to ordinary people.  This other group of whom you speak who were not enfranchised - who are they ???
Comment130	Johnson is sucking that old drunk Junker.
Comment131	Sinn Fein welcomes the support of the Conservative Party for the reunification of Ireland.
Comment132	Good on you DUP. The deal seems ok but not at your expence.
Comment 132.1	Lol
Comment133	Hard brexit = Orwellian language for Brexit
Comment134	It is clear that once again the UK has surrendered to the fear of the parliamentary machine and The EU - The ridiculous view that right will be effected is rubbish - see Bill of rights 1689, And all UK law which will still apply - what would not apply under a good deal would be EU law which is based on a different legal system. Still you get the politicians you deserve and since no-one in the UK understands the EU&#39;s agenda of the superstate, Abolishing of Monarchy in name and self-appointed political presidents ( that Trump types in forever and no electorate to vote in another candidate at the end of a set term) its not surprising the whole thing has been a shambolic affair. De-Gaulle knew Britain well he blocked our membership because he knew the advantage of a true democratic country on the doorstep of Europe would be a backstop to the EU if it turned into a dictatorship.
Comment135	Piss off Owen you unctuous g*t
Comment136	Fantastic DUP, so pleased you have stuck to your word. Boris is a POS traitor. Vote Tories OUT, Farage IN!
Comment137	Free British occupied northern ireland.
Comment 137.1	The wishes of Northern Irish unionoists shoudl not be denied them.
Comment 137.2	@John Vectravi and they can feck off.
Comment 137.3	@Terry Turner True, but the majority of people on the island of Ireland want a united Ireland.
Comment 137.4	Free Irish occupied Britain.
Comment 137.5	Free Muslim occupied middle east.
Comment138	For Brexit now the best deal is have a deal‚Ä¶ Just, do it!.avi
Comment139	So, de facto The North reunites with the Republic of Ireland.
Comment140	Refuse everything then all die together, your plan is it?
Comment 140.1	Like Baldrick as a defence witness - deny everything Baldrick - nods - are you private Baldrick ? - No ! - You are Captain Blackadders Batman ?  - No I&#39;m Not !! - I see but that is Captain Blackadder in the witness box right now ?  - No it isn&#39;t !!! etc etc
Comment141	What Boris did was putting lipstick on a pig ~ Nigel
Comment142	If some how Northern Ireland was running out of air and they could only get supplies from the Republic  the DUP would still say NO !......with their dying breath! That&#39;s how stupid &amp; stubborn they are up there.
Comment 142.1	@Krass Estranged Over here we don&#39;t even march to put our point of view across unless it&#39;s the remoaners and their pointless little get togethers.  I honestly don&#39;t know what the reaction would be if the UK cut the strings.  What do you think ?  Would the absence of the border make it easier for the Irish Government to clamp down on such activities ?
Comment 142.2	@Andrew_Simpson Depictions <br />it was you that brought up shopping centres lul. <br />It&#39;s my hope loyalists never feel the need to take violent actions again. Do you think that they&#39;re more or less likely to be violent if the UK abandons them?
Comment 142.3	@Krass Estranged You sure no loyalist bombs have been planted then ???
Comment 142.4	@Andrew_Simpson Depictions that comment shows exactly why you shouldn&#39;t have an opinion on this.<br />The DUP are Unionists. No shopping center has been bombed for unionism.
Comment 142.5	@Krass Estranged I take it that you admire people who plant explosives in shopping centres.
Comment143	At the end of the day.. Anything a Tory tells us that&#39;s good.. You know it&#39;s bad. That&#39;s why you should never vote for them or anything they put across to us.
Comment144	I think that after we leave the EU there won‚Äôt be any further referendums to rejoin it because it won‚Äôt exist.
Comment 144.1	hopefully so
Comment145	Sinn Fein thanks you Boris for your support of a united Ireland.
Comment146	Its understandable that the DUP rejected May&#39;s deal. Yet what they are asking for now is wrong. Plain and simple. They are meant to run the Northern Ireland assembly with Shinn Fien. This is an issue for them to sort out. It shouldn&#39;t be on the UK or the EU to fix Northern Ireland&#39;s broken parliament.
Comment 146.1	Sinn Fein broke the parliament by walking out because they didn&#39;t get their Irish language act, something that was never part of the Belfast agreement. We aren&#39;t going to give it to them, so the parliament is dead in the water. It&#39;s their doing, not the DUP.
Comment147	Independents for Scotland thanks Boris you have been a great help
Comment 147.1	Scotland will jump into something no one will support them with after the.. fact.. UK will boycott Scotlands good after there blatant cowdise
Comment 147.2	The English have destroyed their own country. Scotland and Wales need to to go independent before they destroy these countries as well.
Comment 147.3	butterflybud1 NO NO NO NO NO to independence for Scotland NO to SNP out with Sturgeon üëéüëéüëéüíÄüíÄüíÄ
Comment 147.4	That would save the English taxpayers a fortune.Heard of the Marshal Plan.
Comment148	Finally Boris Johnson realizing that making deals with the devil(DUP) is political suicide. They are self serving modern nazis who don‚Äôt care less about the MAJORITY of people in Northern Ireland. They simply get off on power!
Comment 148.1	Spoken like a true ignorant bigot.
Comment149	Boris, the betrayer of the British Union, has the full support of Sinn Fein. Who said only Jeremy supported them?
Comment150	There is something strange in my latest video üò±

Comment152	I hope parliament considers very carefully their next move because the British people  are on the edge with this whole situation<br />Implement the vote or hold a general election ENOUGH<br />No more referendums ever
Comment153	This is dead in the water, the sh!sters are rubbing their hands, grinning and cant wait till Saturday to vote it down.
Comment 153.1	@Arfur Fuxxakes Tbh. I hope so.
Comment 153.2	Boris wants it voted down, it&#39;s all about who he can blame in the upcoming General Election.
Comment154	UK should be kicked out from EU
Comment 154.1	@Rev. Sean Titus Do you think that President De Gaulle when he wasn&#39;t taking credit for defeating the Germans single handedly would have wanted the community to be extended to 28 members and counting ?
Comment 154.2	Kick them out of Europw
Comment 154.3	President de Gaulle was perhaps right in not seeing the UK as sufficiently invested in the European project.
Comment 154.4	The EU should be kicked from Europe.<br />The EU are anti-European.
Comment 154.5	@Ellie Finn Seconded
Comment155	Anyone who didn&#39;t realise the Irish border problem when they voted leave was either ignorant of the facts or just believed the lies.
Comment 155.1	There is no problem with the border, except for the EU. They need to control it, so let them.
Comment 155.2	@Ellie Finn Brexit will fail because of the Border issue
Comment 155.3	Just Playing Bass or nobody cares
Comment156	"The question to ask is does NI want to be in the UK or the EU?<br />Why should they be allowed to have it both <a href=""http://ways.london/"">ways.London</a> voted remain.what happens if the capital city with a population of around ten million decide to start demanding they have a say in how the Brexit deal happens."
Comment 156.1	fair point
Comment157	The best news I heard today was Nicky Morgan exploring the possibiltiy of the BBC becoming a subscription service!!!....YIPPEE....about time the far left Marxist bullshit organisation had to fend for itself.....complete garbage
Comment158	No referendaum, Labour won&#39;t support an election so why should they get their way they won&#39;t stand for the right to represent the people.
Comment 158.1	@Arfur Fuxxakes He offered an election and they refused end of.<br />The only one confused is Corbyn been a Eurosceptic most his life now suddenly for it. <br /><br /> Come next election you will see the destruction of the labour party.
Comment 158.2	Labour do want an election. <br /><br />Haven&#39;t you been paying attention? <br /><br />They just don&#39;t want parliament to close so that Boris can drop us out of the EU with no deal during the election. <br /><br />How can you have an opinion when you&#39;re not in command of the facts?<br /><br />No wonder you&#39;re upset, you&#39;re so confused.
Comment159	Congratulations. God bless UK. Long lives
Comment 159.1	God has not shown his face and been playing the longest game of hide and seek in the history of time.  God is the greatest delusion of the low IQ and intellectually castrated.  Dream of god all you want and waste your life.  Good luck with that.
Comment160	This is NOT Brexit.
Comment 160.1	Miele Rodriguez so what is it then?
Comment161	The DUP is against anything that would require them to join the 21st century. The most regressive party in the western hemisphere.
Comment 161.1	DUP should now be cast aside!! So we can get on with this now. DUP out!
Comment 161.2	@David Hargreaves Try taking off your blinders before offering advice on vision.
Comment 161.3	@Sean Brennan I dont want to adapt to your version of &#39;change&#39; thanks.I think you will &#39;see the light&#39; as well in time......
Comment 161.4	@Neil Mo I agree Ben Shapiro is a neo fascist.
Comment162	Fake Brexit
Comment163	Looks like Boris is going to get what he wants......majority in next election if parliament rejects deal ( Boris can then endorse the deal with a majority in Parliament or majority in next election as the guy who got UK out of the EU with an  acceptable deal. Unless, a majority  of mps have to guts to force a referendum ( unlikely) on the deal
Comment164	It&#39;s always hilarious to watch the English bugger themselves and then congratulate themselves afterwards
Comment 164.1	4c1dr3fl3x it‚Äôs even better to watch Scottish MPs making a fool of themselves every time they open their god dam mouths
Comment165	So Boris won¬¥t be able to pass a deal in parliament, just like May wasn¬¥t able to do during the last 3 years...Shocking!
Comment 165.1	@Ellie Finn Elected representatives means elected representatives.
Comment 165.2	first Impression treacherous MPs playing party politics ignoring the people. Leave means leave
Comment166	I hope the DUP don&#39;t push too much and risk losing more than they already have! This looks like the best solution and I hope it serves all of Ireland well.
Comment 166.1	I do too.
Comment167	Scotland: We want the same as NI with the only difference, we don&#39;t mind a hard boarder with England. Vote for this deal and we will soon send you queue up at the Hadrian wall.
Comment 167.1	Alex Bon You need a snack in the mouth for that .
Comment 167.2	Dave Cawood Are you actually mental ? , without the money from Scottish oil England would be a wasteland on it&#39;s knees .
Comment 167.3	Ellie Finn Independence is a cert for Scotland you worthless piece of trash , so shut it you dirty slag .
Comment 167.4	I&#39;m up for hard borders with Scotland. They are a parasitic drain on the rest of the UK. They cost us millions. A country full of junkies, nothing more.
Comment 167.5	Ellie Finn Nicola sturgeon will bring Scotland down
Comment168	don&#39;t think DUP are relevant anymore, socialists look absolutely gutted
Comment 168.1	M. K. The dup are not socialists idiot. You‚Äôre just another moron with zero clue about he engages in. Typical low info voter
Comment 168.2	The DUP have decided they want to remain in the UK.<br />I&#39;d say those who funded brexit to crash the pound are looking shakey now.
Comment169	English people have shit for brains.
Comment170	Good Boris is yet another betrayer.<br /><br />Time for a GE and yet again a new PM, hopefully farage
Comment 170.1	@Geth Creator Although... there was that Opinium poll. Perhaps he could ride that &quot;get it done&quot; protest tail wind into the mainstream again. Not as PM, but if he gets his skates on he might be able to cause a ruckus in Parliament. Who knows, really? Shrug.
Comment 170.2	@Geth Creator Certainly. They haven&#39;t had power, they don&#39;t have power, and they won&#39;t have power. They had great influence in running a very successful campaign to get the referendum. But they&#39;d need more experience than that to have the credibility to run the country. <br /><br /><br />I&#39;ve never heard of a Prime Minister who wasn&#39;t leader of the party holding the majority in the House of Commons, or at least able to assemble a working majority through coalition. What I&#39;m getting at is that Nigel Farage will never be PM.
Comment 170.3	Geth Creator the most likely outcome, based on polling averages so far (which is all we‚Äôve got to go on until it happens) is the Tories will get the most seats and tbh probably a fair few more than Labour, but anti-no Deal parties (Labour, LD‚Äôs, Greens, SNP, PC and ex-Tories who stand again) will command a majority together rather than pro-no Deal parties (Tories and BP).<br /><br />It will be a VERY shaky alliance though and one that only exists to primarily stop the Tories and then maybe call a 2nd Ref, *maybe*.<br /><br />Such an alliance wouldn‚Äôt be able to sort Brexit without a 2nd Ref though, as it‚Äôs full of Remainers, Soft Leavers and a few hard Leavers none of which would be able to agree on anything, so they‚Äôll get nowhere unless the make the people decide.
Comment 170.4	@gomey70 keep dreaming? So who do you think will get a majority? Tories who constantly betray, Labour who betrayed their own manifesto the day the votes came in 2017 or the brexit party who rely on leavers of which belong to either Labour or the tories? There will be no majority but there is very much a real chance of Farage PM and the tories forced  into a brexit party led coalition if they want to survive.
Comment 170.5	@Geth Creator keep dreaming.
Comment171	May dropped us in it. We should have just left and then got on to the trade deal &#39;meat&#39; which still has to be done but with our hands tied&#39; if this &#39;deal&#39; is adopted.  veaterecosan
Comment172	YooKai is in turmoiiiiiiiiiil ,<br />ahhahaahhaa üòÜ
Comment173	I want anything that will anger remainers
Comment 173.1	I cant wait for an election when they lose their seats...popcorn time.
Comment174	About time we dumped Northern Ireland and Scotland.
Comment175	Just give NI back to Ireland, it doesn‚Äôt rightfully belong to the UK as we stole it to start with.
Comment 175.1	bullshit
Comment176	fuck all this, no deal is the best deal
Comment177	Labour is full of tossers
Comment178	Just an outsiders viewpoint here. I see that Johnson calls the agreement a &quot;great deal that takes back control&quot;. I have always thought that demand for a product controls the supplier and availability of the product controls demand. So in fact, no-one is in control of anything! Ironically a good example of this would a recent article I read that said the U.K. has past the mid-point of using renewable energy sources (I love that), while America has taken the great leap backwards to fossil fuels. The point being the American government (Trump)  cannot control the future of energy at all. Eventually America will be pulled into the renewable energy usage and have to rely on other countries for the latest technologies in that field because America wanted to be in control. Globalization is inevitable due to the sheer numbers of both suppliers and demand markets coupled with the advances in communication and shipping technologies.
Comment179	In portuguese we have a word to this labor party speach, and it‚Äôs ‚Äúmigu√©‚Äù<br />‚ÄúMigu√©‚Äù discrabes a person that you can see on his/her face that is lying. Lying so bad that anyone can notice it. And ‚Äúmigu√©‚Äù also includes the real cause, a political cause, or when this person want a compensation or a get a advantage of the situation.
Comment180	I am very disappointed with our MPS. . . the Brexit went Boris Johnson way .. . . it means our way and the EU agreed to our conditions  ... so why on earth would our MPS  reject it  üò®üò°
Comment 180.1	world frank. Because the SNP Labour &amp; Lib Dem‚Äôs want to stop brexit and vote Boris out of office
Comment181	Fuck off BBC , you&#39;ve shown your true colours to the British public
Comment182	Decay continues. Everything only to remain hidden London City bank records of rotten dealings, laundered money, evaded taxes, stolen from Africa, Asia, other EU countries...
Comment183	If there‚Äôs a chance of a United Ireland the Loyalist terrorist groups (UVF and UFF) will Start attacking again I feel, With the IRA not satisfied either, The troubles could flare up again
Comment 183.1	Dixie Normous<br />For example, If the UFF/UDA wanted revenge then why didn‚Äôt they go after IRA members after Teebane instead of shooting 5 innocent Catholics in a bookies, same with IRA bombing on the Shankill why didn‚Äôt they specifically target IRA members instead of killing innocent Catholics. I understand both Loyalists and Nationalists are very passionate about their identity but when the terrorist groups on both sides were killing innocents from both communities it is just purely deplorable
Comment 183.2	The UVF and UFF gave us revenge for the IRA murdering our people. The IRA violence came first. Learn some history instead of talking shite on the interweb. UVF and UFF will not initiate violence. They seek only to defend and exact revenge.
Comment 183.3	everywhere in the world that the english have gone, there has been trouble.
Comment184	Failing this final debacle there should be no extension of article 50.  It is time for the rest of Europe to be done with this issue which has existed from the very day the UK joined the EEC.  The UK establishment cannot deal with the loss of empire and the industrial and economic prowess of Germany.  They were never going to be happy in a community of equals.  The elephant in the room is the fact that there is no future in a border on the island of Ireland either economical or political, but to address that issue would be the very last gasp of empire.
Comment 184.1	@Dixie Normous There is obviously little comparison between the German economy and that of other states, I was referring to equal voting rights within the community and a revolving presidency.
Comment 184.2	Duh. A community of equals? You having a laugh? How is Greece equal to Germany?

Comment 187.1	Your stupidity is as huge as your ignorance
Comment188	BBC labour DUP SNP Lib Dems. TRAITORS Fake news.. you lost we the people won . F $#! OFF
Comment189	I love the reporting from the BBC now known as the EU broadcasting company
Comment190	We all do regret the UK leaving the EU, but one has to remember that Europe looks up to the British people for their historical stability of character and poise. Rejecting this deal and asking for a second extension, holding another referendum etc will ridicule the entire nation for the foreseeable future regardless of the second (penultimate?) outcome. There is such a thing as a reputation and it is of some importance in international affairs. Honour the result of the first vote and there&#39;ll be ample opportunity to work together in the future, outside or in the periphery of EU structures. Writhe around in the House of Commons for the 4th consecutive time and watch the entire continent smile in political contempt.  Take it from a Greek: we had a similar referendum and cancelled it the morning after. We have since become utterly irrelevant in international politics and our people are simply defeated in spirit. Not something to emulate, surely. One last continental imperative: stand by the decision you made, or it won&#39;t matter to anyone if you appear to make any decisions in future.
Comment 190.1	I thought we had already been given a second extension which runs out on the 31st ?
Comment 190.2	If they do it we&#39;ll fight them. Politically of course :)

Comment 192.1	Good! The less materialistic, the better!
Comment 192.2	lmao your about 10 years too late with the whole buying own home BS........but blame brexit if it makes you feel better.
Comment193	And Farage is begging to remain ... TRUE üòÇ
Comment194	The vote was for LEAVE not necessarily to leave with a Deal
Comment195	If you want another referendum it‚Äôs simple: accept the deal, leave the EU fight the next election having in your manifesto a new referendum on reintegration in the EU and if you remainers will eventually win the referendum; then you can freely bring your deal or terms of reintegration to the people for another referendum. However, those backing Brexit today will not force you to do so, because we understand and respect the democratic  will of majority. Let‚Äôs get real, responsible and serious for the good of the UK people and stop crucifying the country for your fantasy and selfish interests. The UK must move now...
Comment 195.1	@Kras T.  today&#39;s 19/10/2019, I don&#39;t see signs of MPs coming to their senses, I&#39;m afraid
Comment 195.2	@adamadappa Aleluia! Is it just me and you thinking this way? Cause if it is just us, then no wonder things went this way. UK has been divided on two fractions leavers and stayers... one arrogantly stupid and one gently stupid. But non of these two actually understands that this bottle has a third side, just like Grant&#39;s whisky, and this is called &quot;referendum&#39;s eligibility&quot;
Comment 195.3	@Kras T. I agree, people got caught up in Cameron foolish (tragically so) attempt to gain more power,  didn&#39;t have the extensive knowledge key to make  a legitimate choice ( they&#39;ve been lied to), but remainers didn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t avoid the referendum.<br />Hence the necessity either to work for the best way possible to honour it (this should be the brexiteers&#39; job... üòë), or to  build the circumstances in which another referendum, and a different outcome, would be possible. <br />It is not what they&#39;ve wished for but, in my truly humble opinion, it is the only way for remainers, + the  indecisive Labour party leader, to  maintain some credibility while giving the people a chance to  keep their faith in democracy.<br />Today is 19 October  and I don&#39;t see much of this,  from either side of Parliament üòí<br /><br />P.S. Sorry for the quality of my English, not my mother tongue
Comment 195.4	Sorry, I am afraid but in democracy is the will of the majority that prevails and is implemented, not other way round. For now the choice is vote for this deal or no deal...
Comment 195.5	@Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov Utter hambug! I hadto read it twice to see if its real, and written by a person. And not a bot.
Comment196	Corbyn &amp; remoaners will reject it, to force a second Brexit referendum &lt;&lt;&lt; FREE ASSANGE
Comment197	Brexit should be put to the people again--now that we know leave was based on lies.
Comment 197.1	"cause you didnt get what YOU wanted sorry thats not how it <a href=""http://works.at/"">works.At</a> least not how Democracy works, do you wanna make it best out of 3, whens it stop!"
Comment198	Well at least the DUP are consistent. They have repeatedly stated that they would rather see the UK stay in the EU than accept a deal that would weaken the Union. Anyone that thought this would all end on Oct 31st are going to be very disappointed. Juncker has already back tracked on his &#39;no extension&#39; comment. The HoC will not support this deal and then the Benn Act will stop a no-deal - Article 51 does not offer sufficient ground for collusion/persuasion - so BoJo will have until Jan 31st to come up with a better deal - odds are shortening on a 2nd referendum and the possibiluty of no Brexit at all - just like the DUP said.
Comment199	Who gives a shit what they think? Why is this even reported
Comment200	Ok, I am confused.. how can u vote on a public referendum when the EU says NO! To an extension. It&#39;s new deal or no deal..... Lol because a deal has been reached tusk says no need for a extension.
Comment 200.1	@Don Scott <br /><br />Serves them right. <br /><br />The DUP tried luring Labour into calling a VONC against May, by telling them they would support them, only to back the Tories. <br /><br />They knew all along that the Tories were going to screw them over, yet still voted with them.<br /><br />They&#39;ve entirely brought this on themselves and can now congratulate themselves that between them and the Conservative and Unionist Party they have put the wheels in motion for a United Ireland.
Comment 200.2	Ahh,,,,what a difference a year makes. The only friends on this planet that the dup have are the Tories. The dup are anti-Labour, anti-SNP, anti-Lib Dems, anti-Irish, anti humanitarians, anti-Catholic, anti-American, anti-European, anti-human rites anti etc, etc, etc. What they are, are pro sectarian, pro anarchy, pro Monarchy, pro-capitalist (against the working and non-working classes) pro career politicians, pro-jobs for the boys, etc, etc, etc and so on and on. They are stuck in the 1600s. They are the bain of the ordinary working-class Loyalist people who are so desperately seeking a better life for their children. The DUP and their lackeys the Tories are doing absolutely nothing to help the working classes progress. In fact, they are consistently holding that group of British citizens, whom they so adamantly claim to be helping, in the poverty, they have been born into. Where do they stand today? At a cliff edge, staring disaster in the eye!. One can not get a better example of being stuck &quot;between a rock and a hard place&quot;. The only way they can go from here is almost certainly negative. If there was a general election in the morning, just take a moment to think about the possible outcomes,,, Labour gets a majority government. The dup are anti-Labour/Corbyn and will get thrown under the bus. The Tories get a majority? they really will be thrown under the bus (maybe, many buses?) as their ten votes would be null and void. A hung parliament? The best outcome for the dup. They could hold the balance of power and have great influence and so strengthen the Union. Well God damn it! that&#39;s what we already have and what benefit has the dup gained? Well, as fate would have it, they have put their beloved union in jeopardy and were thrown under the Boris bus. You couldn&#39;t make it up. Boris is a career politician, just like the dup members all are. Self-centred, only concerned with their own legacies at the expense of their constituents whom they claim to look after. They have dug their own graves. Their only friend on the planet has done them over. Need I say more?
Comment 200.3	The EU has not refused an extension...
Comment 200.4	Boris has reheated May&#39;s deal, of course the EU are happy about it and feel that it should be accepted without delay.
Comment 200.5	The EU hasn&#39;t been asked for an extension. They&#39;re hoping it wont come to that.
Comment201	Bbc should be shut down.
Comment202	Labour the party of mass uncontrollable immigration is not fit for British purpose.
Comment203	What polls is this guy seeing??? Leave is leading on polls I‚Äôve seen
Comment 203.1	Ah---but leave is based on a &quot;feeling&quot; while the truth (which isn&#39;t what you voted on) is based on facts.
Comment204	We want what we voted for a full independent Britain .
Comment 204.1	@David Gunter there are lies and bigger lies, sir.
Comment 204.2	Which is what we always had?
Comment 204.3	You voted on lies.  You will not gain a thing from Brexit, that&#39;s a guarantee.  I hope the DUP sticks to its guns and there is a new referendum based on the truth.

Comment 207.2	D J well said
Comment 207.3	@Krass Estranged inflicted on us?......it might have something to do with 300 years of sectarian terror and segregation against the indigenous majority? Treating them like second class citizens on their native land,denying them housing, work, the right to vote, freedom of religion etc.
Comment 207.4	@RED aye its definitely the DUP that&#39;ve held up prosperity in our wee country. Not the socialist terror campaign inflicted on us for 30 years.
Comment208	Bravo DUP!  Stick to your guns!  Brexit is a shameful move based on lies upon lies.
Comment 208.1	which was voted for, democracy what a joke
Comment209	DUP are racists, bigots, xenophobes and oppose any LBGT rights. These are the people deciding the future of the entire UK.<br />What a great system you guys have, not!
Comment 209.1	Oh I am a Belfast Catholic by the way so not biased me thinks
Comment 209.2	Patrick Johnson check your facts there Patrick... DUP were formed in 1971 so hardly supported an apartheid for generations. Paisley and MgGuinness took steps and embraced their differences to power share. I&#39;m not a DUP supporter but<br />a separate VAT system for NI is crazy and full of red tape and extra paper work for businesses here. Also the suggestion of a level playing field essentially means any future trade deals with the rest of the world are completely pointless as we would have to mirror current EU rules
Comment 209.3	@Aidey Watts <br />Just google DUP racist and I&#39;m.sure yiu will get all the opinions you want in that respect .<br />    Or just google Sammy Wilson and racist .
Comment 209.4	Everyone knows they hate Catholics. They are a binary lot. Anything good for the Catholics is bad for them.<br /><br />They supported a sectarian apartheid system in NI for generations with the Westminster turning a blind eye.<br />They are unfortunately afraid of the future but it&#39;s coming. They need to embrace whatever it is and if they put their massive potential to work for them and their children they will never look back.<br />They should be proud of their heritage but it should not be a mill stone around their necks.
Comment 209.5	Tell me when the DUP have been racist
Comment210	The DUP are a lost cause and have been for a long time, inward-looking, they do not like anyone, in the words of the most reverent and most saintly man Ian  Paisley Never, Never, Never No No No No No No.   it will not be long before you will have a complete break up of the good old Uk, Scotland and North of Ireland will be leaving shortly,  out Celtic cousin may stay with England, the professional politicians are blind to the future but they be OK  they will get their hefty pensions paid in full,, the losers are the normal everyday people, I willing to bet my most favorite battered old leather boots in this, the ones with worn-out soles that  I wore too many Thin Lizzy, Rory Gallager, Doctor Feelgood and many other great band gigs, mark my words this will happen in less than 5 years,
Comment 210.1	The only thing that will break up the &quot;good old UK&quot; is people like you, who want to give our sovereignty and our money to an undemocratic foreign state and who make snide remarks about their fellow citizens political representatives as if they were inferior to yours. Leftists, liberals, progressives are all cancer to the nation.
Comment 210.2	The DUP may be the reason why the UK gets a clean break Brexit.  Thank your lucky stars, your god, your rabbits foot for them.
Comment211	PUBLIC OPINION SHIFTED YOU ARE A LIAR. PUBLIC OPINION WILL REVEAL THE TRUTH .IF YOU ARE RIGHT WHY ARE YOU RUNNING FROM A GENERAL  ELECTION?

Comment219	Stay EU
Comment220	Eventhough they already agreed to his deal on the 2nd of October, they are nothing but rhetoric and u-turn.Scared to lose their veto.
Comment 220.1	Yes - agreed
Comment221	Why is bbc so against the democratic will of the people?<br />Totalitarian filth...
Comment222	It is a frigging insult to ask for another referendum when people have STOPPED the results of the  first  one being carried out. They need to stop whingeing and get on with it. Not everyone is happy after a local election, you cannot please all of the people all of the time, but we get on with it. A vote is a vote and should be respected, otherwise, why bother voting at all?
Comment223	I live in northern ireland and I say fuck the DUP and Sinn Fein, they&#39;ve caused nothing but fuckin murder and mayhem for years in my country, I say back Boris Johnson&#39;s deal and get Brexit done.

Comment 226.2	The sooner the dup are put into dustbin of bigotry politics the better. They would jump at the chance to run the north of Ireland with the big stick as they did in the past
Comment 226.3	I am happy with this compromise.  It allows Northern Ireland to decide for itself.  In the long run it is up to Ireland , north &amp; south to continue to be an integrated, peaceful community, where people are free to trade, live in harmony.  Whilst still being close to the UK.  The DUP have shown their true colours.  They only care about union with UK, at all costs, with no care of maintaining a peaceful democratic society.<br /><br />I am not in favour of Brexit, but it was voted for &amp; this is probably as good as it gets.  I think MPs should either vote to accept it, or have a referendum on the Boris deal or remain.  Since the original referendum had no details, just a vague promise.  What does everyone else think?
Comment 226.4	@Cake and CO. A united Ireland shouldn&#39;t happen? (if that&#39;s what you meant?) I wonder why there is a provision for it in the Good Friday Agreement if it absolutely should not happen? Why should it not happen? If a border referendum both North and South elects for unification then under the terms of the Agreement, unification must happen.
Comment227	No agreement = no deal .    <br />No deal by the 31st Oct means ( according to Boris ) Means we leave without a deal <br />= Clean break Brexit <br />= WTO terms. <br />= 2016 referendum resuls respected.<br />Case closed.

Comment230	What was promised in 2016 was that our decision would be FINAL
Comment 230.1	@Old Woman - please stop with the ‚Äúif you are so sure‚Äù nonsense.  The referendum has NOT been implemented yet.  Tell your remoaner MP‚Äôs that unless and until each MP who either switched parties or went against the will of their constituents agrees to immediately hold a bye election (after all, what are they afraid of?) stuff your second referendum nonsense where the sun doesn‚Äôt shine.  Hypocrisy, thy name is Remoaner.
Comment 230.2	Old Woman because we know we will be stitched up in some way probably by 2 questions, do you want this deal or to remain - i.e. remain or remain
Comment 230.3	@andre yes--let true democracy work; if you are so sure it&#39;s a real majority, then why are you afraid of a referendum?  Did you think your lies would work forever?  That is NOT democracy.  Most assuredly not.
Comment 230.4	@Old Woman you mean the majority of this country, sorry old woman maybe you should wake up and allow Democracy to work instead of fighting it
Comment 230.5	You were also promised lower taxes, no administrative difficulties, an end to austerity and an improved NHS.  You voted on lies.  Let&#39;s see if the people are a bit more awake, this time.

Comment233	The DUP have just made a complete pills of this from Start to finish , first they went for leave meaning SF were bound to go for remain and also shift their unpopular¬† Eurosceptic position in the Republic - so error one increase SF&#39;s influence and make them look more reasonable . Then the¬†demanded that May drop the NI backstop only and go for a uk wide one that stopped her deal and as now lead to this which is the backstop without the good bits .¬†There own voters will see them as sell outs or fools and everybody else as just trouble .

You cant even find a shop open on Sundays in Northern Ireland till 1,30 pm because of these nut jobs, you have to get your breakfast bits Saturday night because of them over here...try living under their rules in N.I... and as for abortion, forget it, they dont care about people, they are religious nutjobs!!
Comment241	This will not pass parliament. Johnson knows this. They would need to buy many (20..30) people with a ton of black money. He will try to get a hard Brexit.
Comment 241.1	@John Wheeler It might force him to ask for an extension but if EU say no extension is allowed then his letter is worthless. Hilary Benn made the mistake of presumption that the EU would allow any extension and didn&#39;t cover that issue in his bill,ultimately it was always upto the EU and we have no say after article 50 was triggered by our stupid politicians who triggered it before negotiations on what deal we wanted instead of after. The only power we have is to revoke.All those amendments are worthless as the decision was never parliaments after the trigger of Article 50.
Comment 241.2	Hopefully EU will stand firm and say &#39;no more extension&#39;. If they allow another extension it&#39;ll go on forever.
Comment 241.3	@John Wheeler Remember it was UK law that we left on March 31st. May got around that using EU law. Boris can do the same. Plus if the extension letter is sent, it will be vetoed.
Comment 241.4	hope so
Comment 241.5	Boris knows his deal is unacceptable to the UK, which is why the EU are pleased with his surrender deal.<br /><br />Boris just wants parliament to be blamed for not accepting his deal, not accepting no-deal, all so he can go into a General Election claiming he got us Brexit and parliament killed it.<br /><br />It&#39;s Populism 101.

Comment 244.4	A Itachi I have never heard such garbage or humbug and claptrap since Corbyn last spoke.
Comment 244.5	the time of caring and pandering to bigots and morons has finally passed. Now, lets see how you do with an un-chained Tory Nazi party stripping away everything that is good for their own gain. Good job on destroying the lives of generations to come... judging by your tone, i assume you are one of those people who vote out of hatred (for stuff you don&#39;t understand) with zero common sense. if I&#39;m wrong, you get a free slap :p
Comment245	What is wrong with the people in the comment section. If you live in the UK you should want to leave the EU no matter what value your freedom over monetary gains. The EU is a rough government much like the Nazi&#39;s except without the racism they want a one world government basically they want to rule with an iron fist
Comment246	Bad deal, no deal. DUP right to reject it. Nigel is waiting.
Comment247	It comes down to money.... Money... Boris will give them (dup) a bung, if he does not sense the numbers in parliament are right.
Comment 247.1	@Media I think he has cornered the dup and the remoaners in. With his bill, this deal or no deal, they will all have to show their true colours... And I don&#39;t think individually the remoaners or dup have the numbers to do anything about it with amendments to such a bill.
Comment 247.2	I don&#39;t think he can do that, he has no majority to pass a budget, anything he offers is just lip service.
Comment248	Almost anything‚Äôs better than the evil, vile and dangerous Labour Party
Comment 248.1	farsensor operant they are not evil unlike the disgusting, silly and evil Labour Party
Comment 248.2	Err, no...the tories are the evil ones...
Comment249	Northern Ireland should quit the U.K. And join the Irish Republic. Problem solved!
Comment 249.1	@Brendan Coughlan The heros of 1916 must be turning in their graves to be under Brussels
Comment 249.2	@Brendan Coughlan IS ireland not smaller than England join the holy empire paddy
Comment 249.3	@wood cutter....better that empire than little England
Comment 249.4	JUST BECAUSE IRELAND HAS JOINED THE EUROPEAN EMPIRE  IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT UNIONIST SHOULD JOIN THIS UNHOLY ALLIANCE. DO YOU NOT BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY? YOU SOUND LIKE A REMOANER.

Comment 251.1	@Debbie Taylor Ignorantia juris non excusat
Comment 251.2	I agree with you. Problem is, they probably do not know the meaning of the word.
Comment252	Regarding Brexit.... F%#+ EVERYONE!
Comment253	No deal then, and pursue for a refund for all the delay. <br />FREEDOM FOR UK ‚úåüèºüá¨üáß
Comment254	to everyone upset, its fine in nov its going to be hit with a lot of court paper and will be deemed unconstitutional :)
Comment 254.1	Maybe, but it seems to only matter if Gina Miller disagrees with it.
Comment 254.2	Hope you&#39;re right.
Comment255	I&#39;m sure Boris will shake the magic tax payers tree, I mean magic money tree... üòÇ
Comment256	When there is a will, there is an agreement - and we have it! This is an honest and balanced agreement for the EU and for the United Kingdom, and it is a manifestation of our desire to find solutions. I recommend this deal for adoption, ‚Äùsaid a Luxembourg politician. Soon, the European Commission published the text of the agreement itself.
Comment257	Boris doesn&#39;t need a majority if the EU decide not to allow an extension as EU law is superior to UK law, which is why the majority of us voted to leave in 2016. MPs are just playing politics as usual and not really interested any more in democracy. However the BBC prefer to interview remainers as usual
Comment 257.1	Junker does not have the authority to refuse an extension. The EU may be getting frustrated with the inability on the UK to agree on any deal, but they will not refuse an extension for they know that this would allow the UK to exit without a deal - they won&#39;t allow this to happen. So the new deal wont get through the HoC and so the EU will give an extension until Jan 31st.  The uk will have a general election and we will all be back at the start. The uk government will then give into demands for a 2nd referendum and the remainers will probably win - then Brexit can be forgotten about and never to be seen again.
Comment258	so we all have to do what11 militant protestants want, pathetic selfish. Just give Ireland back to the Irish, problem solved.
Comment259	Scrap the BBC.
Comment 259.1	I like it.üëç
Comment 259.2	@sadie power Them remainer remoaners certainly didn&#39;t find the pill on that Friday morning palatable - half of them are still in denial three years on.
Comment 259.3	The truth is a bitter pill to swallow,just do the Ostrich on it,stick your thick head in the Sand.
Comment 259.4	Too right, this is where our license money goes.

Comment 265.1	The DUP have just made a complete pills of this from Start to finish , first they went for leave meaning SF were bound to go for remain and also shift their unpopular¬† Eurosceptic position in the Republic - so error one increase SF&#39;s influence and make them look more reasonable . Then the demanded that May drop the NI backstop only and go for a uk wide one that stopped her deal and as now lead to this which is the backstop without the good bits . There own voters will see them as sell outs or fools and everybody else as just trouble .
Comment266	Your the  man Boris well done you.
Comment267	Labour want another referendum but you lost the first time round are can you ask for a second referendum
Comment 267.1	"The BBC would never aggrandize or mis represent anything. Never! lol.  Christian have been claiming god exist, but so far he proves to be playing the longest game of hid and seek in the history of time.

Comment 267.3	@Ra Viking Another source worth perusing, the University of Portsmouth supports my text.
Comment 267.4	@Ra Viking Take it up with the BBC, they are the ones that said it, I`m just passing on the info, or the BBC not to be believed?
Comment 267.5	@Graham Shepherd Well you seem to be in the know but do more research before you give yourself a pat on the back.  No referendum is binding on the UK government because parliament is sovereign, not the people.  Therefore, any referendum only becomes information a government can choose to use or not.   Simples!

Comment 269.1	get a job, you‚Äôll feel better
Comment270	At least the EU have rejected an extension, so Benn&#39;s Surrender extension act goes in the bin where it belongs.
Comment 270.1	Evelyn Fullerton only if there was no deal he has got a deal with the EU now it‚Äôs Parliament to make the next move with millions watching waiting and listening many of them angry at the betrayal of our democracy üò°üò°üò°üò°
Comment 270.2	Evelyn Fullerton  A letter maybe, but the all important bit is the subject of its contents. I,m afraid you have to accept the fact we are leaving the EU. After all it‚Äôs only right that the 52% 17.4 million who voted have it honoured , respected and delivered.
Comment 270.3	Jacob Jorgenson  We only need one EU country to not want an extension. Do you honestly think for one moment that an extension for any length of time is going to resolve this situation. Think again sunshine. U.K. WILL be leaving the EU.
Comment 270.4	@Jacob - grow up.  It‚Äôs been decided.  No one will go against what the EU leadership want.<br /><br />Not if they don‚Äôt want to lose their EU money, that is.
Comment 270.5	@Jacob Jorgenson No, actually they will not be voting on it.
Comment271	NEW DISASTEROUS NEW SURRENDER TREATY. EU happy.<br />As JUNKER <b>**YELLS, I AM SPEAKING**</b> and you better listen....clearly indicates where AUTHORITY lies<br />and that is not with Boris. EU has slipped and showed how the STRONG-ARM will be implemented.<br />Remember NATION, when they try to catch a bird, they sing to <b>him</b> sweet song.<br />Are we not FORTUNATE in the UK, that our head/PM had a huge basket of CONCESSIONS to draw from and make this disastrous TREATY deal with laughing EU EMPIRE.
Comment272	Again, why did the U.K. vote for BREXIT?ü§îü§îü§î
Comment 272.1	@WasRemainNowLeave Ireland has simply done amazing in the EU a d gas finally Benn able to rise from the English shackles of past tyranny
Comment 272.2	@WasRemainNowLeave I&#39;m Danish, we don&#39;t feel bullied, but go on  about what you nothing, it&#39;s the brexiter way. Btw what happened to Easiest deal ever! 350mill a week for NHS! We will be in Berlin the day after the vote!<br />This deal will never pass parliament because it&#39;s shit and will hurt the UK
Comment 272.3	Because of mass unsustainable immigration. Most of the Brits North of Watford, did not give a toss about  free trade deals, or the Sovereignty of local politics. <br />Fact the highest  Brexit  votes occurred  in town  saturated with EU Migrants
Comment 272.4	If you need to ask. You need to check out how undemocratic  the EU is &amp; how it is run, how it bullied member states.. ireland, denmark, netherlands, greece etc
Comment 272.5	Because the EU is becoming a superstate .
Comment273	If parliament ok&#39;s this deal, does that mean Farage comes back to England with his minions?

Comment280	Economic well being of Northern Ireland has always been in shit.  Majority of people are employed by the public sector and have always been in the red every year, needing millions in charity from Westminster just to keep their joke of a society swept under the British rug.  DUP will agree by Christmas. They are just saving face in front of their bigotted uneducated constituents.
Comment281	Hopefully the Northern Irish will boot the DUP back to the Old Testement in the next Election.  They‚Äôve had their moment in history.
Comment 281.1	@ Dixie I am not asking you to like it , and you are paying for it¬†already ¬†if you are a UK or Irish taxpayer - You Can abuse me if you like , what I was explaining to you was that it ¬†won&#39;t alter the fact¬†these abotions are happening anyway
Comment 281.2	@5888max Who is abusing you? if you are you are triggered by facts that is not my fault. Saying that people will do bad things anyway so we should just make the bad things legal is plain dumb. Have as many abortions as you want, just don&#39;t expect me to like it or pay for it.
Comment 281.3	Dixie It is no good abusing me for pointing out the facts - I don&#39;t care what you do or don&#39;t do , But minding your own business would be what I would advise . You are not required to have an abortion so don&#39;t stress yourself about other Peoples choices , they will do it anyway all you can do is make it more divisive. It is also nothing to do with Left or Right , People on the left and the right are like you they won&#39;t to use the power of the¬†State to make other people do things , personally I¬†start from the position of not bossing , obviously I am pragmatic and would like to stop people murdering each other , not that we have been very good at that in this part of the world
Comment 281.4	@5888max Well people can want. I want to be a billionaire but its not going to happen, is it? People want to commit murder too, should we just allow them to because, you know, they will just do it anyway? Typical leftist logical fallacy.<br /><br /><br />You want me to fund someone elses child because they are too dumb not to get pregnant when they have no job or no money? LOL Yeah right. Let them deal with the consequences of their stupidity. Bring up the child or kill it and go to jail for infanticide.
Comment 281.5	Hunter Alliance get about 8% of the Vote that is the reasonable Progressive vote Here , so don&#39;t hold you breath SF and the DUP are the biggest parties because the public are extreme ( and in my view Idiots)
Comment282	Finally. Hopefully now we can deal with all the stabbings in this country instead of the remainers moaning about what our country wanted 3 years ago. Free to trade with the rest of the world at last
Comment283	The Unionist population of Northern Ireland are descendants of immigrants who were moved there a few centuries ago by the British government which wanted to consolidate their power in Ireland which Britain had occupied, just like it had occupied countries all over the world because imperialism was the word of the day. Now that imperialism is dead, I have a suggestion. Why don&#39;t the loyalists get the fuck out of Ireland, where they never had any business being in the first place, and simply move back to British mainland, so that Ireland may be free, and belong solely to the Irish people?
Comment 283.1	@Ellie Finn That&#39;s what I was suggesting. The six counties must join the Irish Republic and Britain must be kicked out, ending an 800 year period of imperial colonial rule and occupation over a foreign country.
Comment 283.2	@Dixie Normous here, here.
Comment 283.3	I take your point Barry, but I am just picking the payment to the EU for comparison purposes. What I am really saying is that the English taxpayers have gotten fed up paying a ton of money into the EU for the glory of trading with their European neighbours and if they realised that they are actually paying more than that¬†for the glory of¬†occupying Ireland then they would probably have views similar to mine - ie that they would be better to think about pulling out of Ireland.
Comment 283.4	@Christopher Forde I would agree with you.
Comment284	No it wouldn&#39;t leave would still win by a landslide
Comment285	No Surrender!!!
Comment286	EU nationals will be able to move seemlessly from the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland, and then a simple boat ride when you don&#39;t need a passport. This deal is worse than May&#39;s.
Comment 286.1	@achimboers All true Britons will burn their clogs!
Comment 286.2	@achimboers I would stop buying dutch produce but I can&#39;t find any on the shelves. What do you actually produce except shitty edam cheese?
Comment 286.3	And yes, please stop buying Dutch produce. Marmite is not good for you anyway.
Comment 286.4	You mean I need to be the US thankful? Because with you Brits the mess you all created with Market Garden the war only took a year longer to finish. Guess you don‚Äôt learn that in your English schools. Should I be thankful for the Dutch cities you bombed, to scared to drop them over Germany. Or want to go back in history? You want me also to be thankful war in Zuid Africa? Killing Afrikaner women en children to beat the Boers. Let me not forget to thank you for that. Rooinek. Maybe you should be thankful we kicked your King out of London and our William on the throne. <br />Absurd. Regardless, stay on your little Island and rule the waves in your bathtub.
Comment 286.5	@achimboers Yeah, nothing to be thankful for, just liberation from the German Nazis who nearly starved you all to death when they flooded your country in retreat. RAF food drop kept you alive. Sorry we ever bothered. Like I said Ingrates the lot of you. Time to stop buying dutch produce i guess.

Comment289	Does anyone give a shit about N.Ireland ??
Comment290	DUP wants to DUPE the people
Comment291	Northern Ireland should break away from the UK and join with the rest of Ireland as a self governing autonomous region of the republic. Regardless of loyalties to the UK, peace and protecting people&#39;s lives is more important. At least in the short term. Could always rejoin the UK later on when proper planning is made.
Comment 291.1	Have you seen the rest of Ireland it&#39;s a foreign shithole with Irish people littered in every street! The Irish Government has sold out it&#39;s people!
Comment292	As I understand it. Juncker has ruled out further extension. So how can we fit in a referendum?

Comment294	FUCK THE DUP and the &quot;union&quot;
Comment295	Another stellar example of how easy it is to find yourself in a mess and how difficult it is to get out.
Comment 295.1	the conservative party is responsible for the biggest deliberate diplomatic and economic blunder in centuries.
Comment 295.2	Hans brought about by British Politicians deliberately setting out to defy the will of the 17.4 million 52% of the vote. .Similar sort of thing happened in Germany during the 30,s where a certain party Nazi Party under Adolf Hitler took out and destroyed his political enemies until he gained the power he wanted. As you well know Hans he succeeded. Back in U.K. present day it‚Äôs not quite so simple.
Comment 295.3	apt description of brexit üëç
Comment296	It a Boris deal which means it won&#39;t be good for the UK or its people but will be very good for the Tories, they get to enact yet more inhuman and draconian rules and thay can call it legally right..

Comment 297.4	It&#39;s an english man in the wrong country.
Comment298	Four years down the road, NI will gradually drift away  from the Union.   By that time Scotland  may well be out already.  Now we hear Wales talking about independence and rejoining EU soon after.   Farage your name will become a byword for a curse in the future.   &quot;Farage off&quot; &quot;He got faraged&quot; &quot;Farage you,&quot; etc.  If I were you I would get my name patented so that you can make more money which is what interests you together with fame and attention.
Comment 298.1	@magic<br /><br />Why does the union matter anyway? <br /><br />All of the countries within the UK, will continue to have a good relationship, as friendly neighbours, even if the union were to break up... being in a union is not essential in order to have good country to country relationships!
Comment 298.2	@Hamish Somerville You are having a laugh. SNP will hold their seats, Brexit party will be irrelevant in Scotland especially. Just as UKIP were irrelevant. Labour are dead and tories havent had a majority in Scotland ever. We are Scottish First, British second and hopefully not at all eventually. <br /><br />Alba gu br√†th you little tory sympathiser.
Comment 298.3	magic Scotland will never get out we are British first and bring on  G E Farage will put SNP back in their box
Comment 298.4	magic hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha hahahahahahaha
Comment 298.5	Wales voted out.
Comment299	The DUP provided the Conservatives with their majority under the last election so no surprises here ....
Comment300	Why on earth does this chap think that British standards would fall bellow the standards that are already in place? Where is his evidence of this statement? Does he think we are going to drop wages to 50p an hour on a 7 day week? Does he think we will now start burning coal at a greater rate just because big brother is no longer watching over us!? It&#39;s time for you to go home and tell the wife to put the kettle on, because you&#39;re making no sense at all.
Comment301	Lots of no workers&#39; rights and no climate change provisions is being heard now and these demnds were always well within Boris Johnson&#39;s knowledge but for some unknown reason seem to have been strategically omitted, with respect.

Comment 302.1	Ireland has only been united under the British lol .
Comment303	Is this Brexit motion amendable?
Comment304	Second referendum vote!!!
Comment305	Johnson must not betray the DUP!
Comment 305.1	@Simon T The airlines require photographic ID (London-Scotland flights included). There is no legal requirement for it between different parts of the UK. I agree that restrictions must tighten as Brexit means control of the borders -- but Northern Ireland is going to be the achilles heel and the smugglers&#39; way in.
Comment 305.2	@Simon T You don&#39;t need photographic ID to travel from Northern Ireland to Scotland.
Comment 305.3	@Simon T After Brexit, the people smugglers will route through Northern Ireland. No passport needed to cross the Irish border and no passport needed between Northern Ireland and Scotland. See?
Comment 305.4	@Simon T Ireland has hundreds of refugees. How did they get there? Once they do, it&#39;s easy to get into Northern Ireland and then across to Scotland. The Johnson surrender deal will crate a smugglers&#39; paradise.
Comment 305.5	@Simon T The smugglers will bring immigrants through Northern Ireland to Britain. At the same time, there will be customs barriers between Northern Ireland - where EU regulations will still apply - and the rest of the UK. It&#39;s worse than May&#39;s deal.

Comment 308.2	Gar Sm , I know. I‚Äòm not one of those who really want NI to be part of the Republic, but since all this Brexshit business, I have gotten to see how bitter and twisted the DUP and their supporters are. I would like to see it happen, just to piss this crowd of bigots off, if nothing else. I know it won‚Äôt happen and would only be a burden on ROI. Can you imagine having that lot as part of the Republic ! They‚Äôd cause nothing but trouble. The Republic is fine as it is.

Comment 310.4	I think it looks like a man in drag..
Comment311	Remember when the Unionists &amp; Loyalists in the north of Ireland only had two friends in the world, the white supremacist Boers of apartheid South Africa, and the violent Zionists in Israeli military intelligence ? <br />Have they any international friends left these days ? Maybe some anti-evolution fundamentalists in the US deep south, the KKK ? <br />The DUP are a 17th century anachronism, the leftovers from Britain&#39;s brutal land clearances and colonial settlement in Ireland. <br />Offer them a billion dollar resettlement in the Falklands maybe ? The dour weather will suit them rightly.
Comment312	What a shock  lol
Comment313	just 64 pages ...  that&#39;s  is a huuuge ecological breakthru from May&#39;s 580 pages ... üòä
Comment 313.1	64 extra pages.
Comment 313.2	64 pages of CHANGES to larger agreement
Comment314	Never thought I&#39;d say it, but well done dup. Brits deserve a second referendum.
Comment 314.1	@Simon Machin &quot;In a 52-48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way. If the Remain campaign win two-thirds to one-third that ends it.&quot; - Nigel Farage
Comment 314.2	And a 3rd or a 4th and on and on until remoaners win huh.
Comment315	The KKK of Antrim/Scotland need to get the boat..
Comment 315.1	@fiveohfivethree lololol
Comment 315.2	The fuck are you talking about üòÇ
Comment316	No deal it is then! üëç
Comment317	The DUP: The finest psychopaths money can buy.
Comment318	The DUP hasn&#39;t even got the support of northern Irish it&#39;s crazy there holding this deal to ransom.
Comment 318.1	@fiveohfivethree it&#39;s the DUP you should direct your anger at ....I believe most Tory&#39;s will vote for it.. he will be begging labour MPs to back the deal.
Comment 318.2	NI voted to remain...You are either for standing by the referendum or you aren&#39;t. Make up your damn minds.
Comment319	Juncker reckons no new extension
Comment 319.1	Junker lies more than Pinocchio, he has his nose trimmed on a weekly basis when he is down the pub, nasal hair an&#39; all.<br />Of course he will grant an extension. Money talks.
Comment 319.2	if there&#39;s no extension lets have no deal as boris slash traitor mays deal will get voted down
Comment320	DUP won&#39;t support?!  then it gets my vote!!
Comment 320.1	@Eoghan Carpenter thanks
Comment 320.2	*Won&#39;t
Comment 320.3	Good enough!
Comment 320.4	The DUP only know how to say No. They&#39;ve never expressed a positive sentiment in their whole existence.
Comment321	Pft. A swift bribe will soon sway their position on the deal.
Comment 321.1	Offer them West Falkland. They&#39;ll love the weather and the bloody jingoist Empire memories.
Comment322	We voted out
Comment323	In 2016 we voted out of sm cu ecj and free movement
Comment 323.1	Gar Sm <br />Yes it‚Äôs lipstick on a pig üê∑
Comment 323.2	EU nationals will be able to move seemlessly from the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland, and then a simple boat ride when you don&#39;t need a passport. This deal is worse than May&#39;s.
Comment 323.3	We voted out
Comment324	For Gods sake, we voted leave. Not differentiate between hard or soft. These MPs are a disgrace! Accept the referenfum.
Comment 324.1	@fiveohfivethree Nope. Do you remember what the result was in the 2016 referendum?  I&#39;m not a leaver btw, I didn&#39;t vote in the referendum as I wasn&#39;t eligible.  I never mentioned the EU in the comment above.  Doesn&#39;t sound like you&#39;re good at maths or even English for that matter.  No matter which side of the argument you stand on you should accept the result of the referendum, that&#39;s what democracy is about.  It might be the right decision, it might be the wrong decision, but it&#39;s democracy, which a lot of people fail to understand.
Comment 324.2	@Dominate955 So...let me get this straight...you are forcing your will upon us just like you say the EU is doing to you? Hilarious.
Comment 324.3	@fiveohfivethree Scotland and NI are part of the United Kingdom.  The United Kingdom voted to leave. &quot;We&quot; means the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  And ignoring the will of the people is revoking article 50 or having a second referendum.  I understand the issue of Brexit is divided, but do you listen to 52% of the country or 48%?
Comment 324.4	@fiveohfivethree you wouldn&#39;t have complained if the vote had gone your way sweetie üòú
Comment 324.5	@nadia c It doesn&#39;t seem very &quot;united&quot; to ignore the will of the people from two of those union countries now does it?
Comment325	Lots of shadow ghosting on here you can‚Äôt question why we aren‚Äôt being told
Comment 325.1	What aren&#39;t we being told? You mean in this 7.5 minute video?
Comment 325.2	This happens a lot on BBC and Channel 4 News YouTube videos. They don&#39;t like comments that call out the globalist agenda.
Comment 325.3	I think it means many of the comments are being either shadowbanned or deleted outright by YouTube‚Äôs algorithms.
Comment 325.4	what the fuck does that mean?
Comment326	Can we just Unite Ireland and get on with our lives, I&#39;m sick of hearing about the DUP and their culture of eating cheddar cheese and pineapple on a stick!!!
Comment 326.1	@James Sempy Turkey will never ever join the EU.
Comment 326.2	@TheCitroenman1 It&#39;s only a matter of time, why can&#39;t you see this???
Comment 326.3	TheCitroenman1 ultimately it will be up to the people of Northern Ireland themselves, but if brexit turns out to be detrimental to the north‚Äôs economy it could be the very thing to tip the balance should a referendum on the union take place
Comment 326.4	@KFC you have no idea keep telling you&#39;re self that
Comment 326.5	@KFC <br />if you think EU gets stronger by adding more and more members,  u r wrong.<br />EU is doomed precisely for that reason: by adding third world coutries eg. Romania, Bulgaria and soon Turkey ...<br />when UK joined in the 70 &#39;s it was &quot; the Common Market&quot; that eveolved to something  different.<br />this EU will implode. no future.<br />FREXIT, DEEXIT ... to follow.
Comment327	Give NI back to the Irish, the Prods are a pain in the lower end.
Comment 327.1	They certainly are, but they‚Äôre staunchly British and will never accept being governed by Irish people, even though they born hereüôÑ
Comment328	What‚Äôs in it ??
Comment 328.1	Nobody knows
Comment329	Remoaner bias, spewing rubbish ... bbc fake news
Comment330	Labor you mean Communist globalist
Comment 330.1	@Evelyn Fullerton ROFL
Comment 330.2	Mike Carone there is nothing wrong with Jeremy Corbyn at least he tells the truth
Comment 330.3	@Rocco Sartche trump is ok its just CIA propaganda
Comment 330.4	What do you expect, he&#39;s a Trump supporter lol
Comment 330.5	@fiveohfivethree Ahh the American obsession with communism that ended 30yrs ago in Russia is so pathetic rofl
Comment331	The Good Friday Agreement is automatically void once Brexit happens. So there&#39;s no need to be part of the Deal.
Comment 331.1	@rapier1954 Farrell international treaty my ass. The Irish Pounds is not even recognised by any country in the world.
Comment 331.2	Eh, no it&#39;s not. And about half a million Irish people in the streets will prove it&#39;s not
Comment 331.3	@Limmy Writer - Absolute Bollox, you moronic Youtube gimp.
Comment 331.4	@rapier1954 Farrell Don&#39;t argue with stupid, because stupid has been arguing with stupid all their life, and they are good at it.
Comment332	Only the Bank of England and the &quot;former&quot; Third World Colonies have something to gain from the Brexit.
Comment 332.1	The bank of England won&#39;t profit from brexit
Comment 332.2	...  that&#39;ll be more slavery and looting!
Comment333	I would like to hear the deal before making judgment
Comment 333.1	Listen Specky the ballot paper said Leave or Stay not a deal
Comment 333.2	good point
Comment 333.3	@Andy N we are not allowed to strike deals with other countries on our terms otherwise. Negotiations are inevitable but a clean break is required first. At the moment bugger all is different oh and we still pay the 39bn, wake up
Comment 333.4	@rick Woods can&#39;t understand how a no deal is better than any deal. Isn&#39;t that what got us in this mess in the first place, by voting leave without any plan in place when we leave? So what will be the plan if we leave without deal? That is the biggest question. Why isn&#39;t Boris saying what the plan is if we leave without a deal. That&#39;s just as stupid as voting Brexit in the referendum.
Comment 333.5	The deal is that, over the coming years, the planters will have to leave and go back home to where they belong.
Comment334	2 mins in and they&#39;re talking about another referendum....
Comment335	Have they ever voted with the Tories?
Comment 335.1	Yeah. Whenever it involved repressing Irish people.
Comment336	Just have United Ireland referendum in 2020.
Comment 336.1	@Max Hall The problem is....Nowhere have the South said they want them. Sinn Fein would have shown up today if they wanted them back that badly! Of course we are paying more to the EU.....lets get rid of that Burden first.
Comment 336.2	@asmrfoodie Uk If you multiple the subsidised ¬£5,500 per person spent in NI by 1.871 million (NI population), you get ¬£10,290,500,000. That is ¬£10.2 billion basically. Over ten years, that would be ¬£102 billion.<br /><br /><br />The population of the ROI is 15 times smaller than that of the UK. Mean the relative of the subsidies to the people of the ROI would be about ¬£150 billion per year. <br /><br /><br />I&#39;m grateful the people of the ROI are willing to make such a sacrifice in order to free us from the burden of providing for them.
Comment 336.3	@Max Hall Scotland is the same too. Utter drain.
Comment 336.4	@derek moore Oh dear Lord, it is worse than I thought. Spending in NI per person is ¬£14,020. Revenue raised per person was ¬£8,580. That is over ¬£5,500 per citizen of NI paid for with other peoples taxes.<br /><br /><br />WHAT DO WE WANT? A UNITED IRELAND, WHEN DO WE WANT IT? NOW. <br /><br /><br />I&#39;m with ya.
Comment 336.5	@derek moore It isn&#39;t tripe, it is fact. NI receives far more in government spending than its citizens and businesses pay in tax. So the choice is A) Budget cuts, or B) tax increases, there is simply no way around it. I agree a united Ireland is the future, we just have different reasons for wanting it to happen.
Comment337	The DUP have insisted upon cheddar cheese with pineapple on a stick.
Comment 337.1	@the BOLLOCKS need another referendum fuck off you don&#39;t have a second referendum cos you don&#39;t like the first idiot suck it up and live with it
Comment 337.2	@Don Scott  not anti everything as you suggest... I think you just got carried away with your own opinion--- but you are right in may things. Boris is a career politician and yes the DUP have got trampled on and will continue to be until they realise tthat the UK just don&#39;t want or care about N Ireland, would dump the unionists in a blink. The Irish border has held the mainland to ransom.  the last vote --- the DUP 10 votes counted for nothing. Basically the Union is Screwed and the DUP put in that position.
Comment 337.3	Ahh,,,,what a difference a year makes. The only friends on this planet that the dup have are the Tories. The dup are anti-Labour, anti-SNP, anti-Lib Dems, anti-Irish, anti humanitarians, anti-Catholic, anti-American, anti-European, anti-human rites anti etc, etc, etc. What they are, are pro sectarian, pro anarchy, pro Monarchy, pro-capitalist (against the working and non-working classes) pro career politicians, pro-jobs for the boys, etc, etc, etc and so on and on. They are stuck in the 1600s. They are the bain of the ordinary working-class Loyalist people who are so desperately seeking a better life for their children. The DUP and their lackeys the Tories are doing absolutely nothing to help the working classes progress. In fact, they are consistently holding that group of British citizens, whom they so adamantly claim to be helping, in the poverty, they have been born into. Where do they stand today? At a cliff edge, staring disaster in the eye!. One can not get a better example of being stuck &quot;between a rock and a hard place&quot;. The only way they can go from here is almost certainly negative. If there was a general election in the morning, just take a moment to think about the possible outcomes,,, Labour gets a majority government. The dup are anti-Labour/Corbyn and will get thrown under the bus. The Tories get a majority? they really will be thrown under the bus (maybe, many buses?) as their ten votes would be null and void. A hung parliament? The best outcome for the dup. They could hold the balance of power and have great influence and so strengthen the Union. Well God damn it! that&#39;s what we already have and what benefit has the dup gained? Well, as fate would have it, they have put their beloved union in jeopardy and were thrown under the Boris bus. You couldn&#39;t make it up. Boris is a career politician, just like the dup members all are. Self-centred, only concerned with their own legacies at the expense of their constituents whom they claim to look after. They have dug their own graves. Their only friend on the planet has done them over. Need I say more?
Comment 337.4	@whitetrout channel Sadly its passed through Government. A delay following an EU extension only there to turn this shite into legislation. Drums can beat all they like, but its a crap deal.  The DUP led us to this point by believing England are honourable towards Northern Ireland. What a joke that has been over the years. Nationalists are laughing ... another step to an all Ireland. The Union is failing.
Comment 337.5	@Ron Patterson sod the good friday agreement? you think things like warringstown and birmingham should be repeated because i can assure you now that will happen if this shite is forced down n.irelands throat the drums are already beginning to beat in the deep, drums they are coming
Comment338	BBC are in meltdown mode! I can almost hear the hysterics from here.
Comment 338.1	@Fonzie <br /><br />Which media outlets do you get your balanced opinion from?<br /><br />Or have you run away out of embarrassment? <br /><br />I&#39;m assuming it&#39;ll be all the rightwing, billionaire owned &#39;free&#39; press.
Comment 338.2	@Fonzie <br /><br />As State Broadcaster it&#39;s an acceptable place to start.<br /><br />I use a range of media to form my views.<br /><br />Which outlets do you get your news from?
Comment 338.3	@Arfur Fuxxakes You still respect the BBC ? rofl
Comment 338.4	It&#39;s a busy day with constant updates, speeches and rolling news.<br /><br />It&#39;s days like this that people get into media for.<br /><br />No need  to go all Trump on them.
Comment 338.5	@Arfur Fuxxakes Never heard so many umms and arrrs so they sure are in a panic state
Comment339	Liberals don‚Äôt want the will of the people. Sick
Comment 339.1	Liberals are the voters you dunce
Comment 339.2	Labels, labels, labels. <br /><br />How simple.
Comment 339.3	Conservatives are no different.
Comment340	<b>Bye Bye EU, Bye Bye EU, Bye Bye EU - BYE BYE!!!!!!</b>
Comment341	Oh dear!
Comment342	Groundhog day!
Comment343	The DUP need to shut up and realise that brexit means brexit
Comment 343.1	They&#39;re not getting the clean Brexit they want. But then they never can!
Comment344	14 more days until the first stage of the break up of the european union.
Comment 344.1	@based zeus idiot
Comment 344.2	Are you drunk? Have you seen the polls? The EU is stronger and more populair than ever, thanks to your Brexit shitshow. Thanks!
Comment 344.3	Seems to me you already got quite independent from the English language!
Comment 344.4	&quot;Indepence&quot; btw!
Comment 344.5	@Arfur Fuxxakes lets hope soüëç
Comment345	money talk&#39;s
Comment 345.1	Yup .. cash is king!
Comment346	DUP is making it so difficult. Why
Comment 346.1	The fear the day that they will have to leave Ireland and return to live amongst their on lot.
Comment 346.2	Because they are not stupid like remainers.
Comment 346.3	That&#39;s the way they operate.
Comment 346.4	EU nationals will be able to move seemlessly from the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland, and then a simple boat ride when you don&#39;t need a passport. This deal is worse than May&#39;s.
Comment 346.5	Potato famine, they haven&#39;t forgot.
