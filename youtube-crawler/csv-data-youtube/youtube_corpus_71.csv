Comment 10.1	@Leroy Sebastian young and fluoride dumb
Comment 10.2	Are you for real......get off on pushing peoples buttons.  So sad for you that you are in so much pain . love to you crazy person
Comment 10.3	@Leroy Sebastian First off, I don&#39;t believe he is in it for the money. Secondly, I&#39;ve been following him for years and he is very good at what he does. He has saved lives and prepared people for earth changes. The uneducated YouTuber Dutch, while young is ahead of his time and first to predict earthquakes. While the educated community may deny his abilities and scoff at him, he&#39;s doing something they don&#39;t and are too closed minded to accept anything they aren&#39;t getting credit for. I have lost total respect of the so called, experts, in their geographical field of expertise. Personally, he hasn&#39;t ripped me off for any finances and I find him most honorable. But thank you for looking out for me.
Comment 10.4	Donna Keeley you don’t understand. YouTube has replaced what us older folks call research. This uneducated YouTuber Dutch is only here for 1 reason, finances.  This is a career for him. Lastly if you want to learn something find a real seismologist and read a published book or article.
Comment 10.5	Then leave! We don&#39;t want to hear your whining. Dutch isn&#39;t here to entertain you, go back to your sandbox!
Comment11	That&#39;s so crazy!
Comment12	Mt Asama in Nagano, Japan.  My son lives there and he was sitting down to dinner the night it erupted!  He was scared out of his wits, being an Aussie born and bred. We don&#39;t have shit like that happening in Australia!  LOL
