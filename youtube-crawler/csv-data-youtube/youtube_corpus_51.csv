Comment1	Figures
Comment2	Uh-oh.  Why has Dutch disappeared?<br />The Robber Barrons must not like how he has exposed the dire consequences of their deep drilling into the crust near volcanoes.<br />Deep drilling for oil and gas (that is, perforating the Craton) near the Carghill Salt Mine tunnels (located one mile under Lake Erie)  is especially dangerous, should an earthquake strike northern Ohio. <br /><br />Ask yourself, &quot;What happens to the Great Lakes, if the salt tunnels collapse?&quot;
Comment3	Coppertropicals where are you?<br />We miss your do, your duds and your voice. At least come back and read poetry or something.<br />Sincerely ...

Comment5	lights coming out of the ground  on marfoogle YouTube page just posted a video of what a lady captured. Look like a storm in the distance in a plane flying and under the plane if you were to imagine a small bomb being dropped it was that&#39;s what it looked like but it was different colors different times and it even happened when the plane was not directly above it so it&#39;s worth checking out I don&#39;t know where it was located

Comment15	FYI a person wrote to USGS an asked about earthquakes he was feeling on Mt Shasta   The said there aren’t any. I replied sometimes they don’t get reported. The admin got furious at me. Ranted and said I would get banned. I helped them and took myself off. Funny thing is some else has reported the 5 earthquakes today
