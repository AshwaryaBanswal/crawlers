Comment1	How come african countries get to have christian genocides and Northern Ireland can&#39;t? Even just a DUP genocide would suffice.
Comment2	undemocratic unionist party, polls in Britain say 60% plus to give Ireland back to the Irish, squatters are not British ie Britain is an island like Ireland, British is not a race, it has no DNA language or national anthem. Time to fix bad decisions by English royal to squat IRELAND. BTW is it still illegal to call yourself English in a English court.
Comment3	If they really want to be British why don&#39;t they move there?
Comment4	The DUP are pushing Northern Ireland away from the rest of Britain. We will leave with the deal worked by Boris but I it would have been better for Britain if the DUP had shown a little loyalty as we have shown to them over the years. It appears to me that the DUP want it all and more, no wonder no one wants to work with then in the NI Parliament. Think again before you loose the will of the rest of Britain.
Comment5	Bojo the clown&quot;s Brexit deal is Brino. (Brexit in name only). DUP are a real Political Party, that serves the interest of Common People. Vote DUP!
Comment6	Mismanaged EU is the issue here and it has reached the unacceptable level.
Comment7	The DUP is a collective of very dumb and backwater people. They are jealous of the Republic of Ireland&#39;s success.
Comment 7.1	They only went for Brexit because they imagined it would destroy the GFA Peace Accord which they voted against, didn&#39;t support &amp; hated. They relished &amp; blissfully dreamed of building a big wall Customs on the border to block out sight of all things Irish which they hate. They took the Brexit advertising money, insisted the border issue was a non issue &amp; happily flew the flag of loyalty, blissfully thinking they&#39;d never have to see the Southern 26 counties on the other side of a massive &#39;Trump style wall&#39; All was happy until UK suggested a possible border in the Irish Sea. Sammy Wilson SHIT a BRICK<br />Nigel tried to catch it<br />Arlene stood beside the door &amp; Whacked it with a broomstick Geoffery shoved it to the door said use it as a door stop<br />Paisley kicked it out the door <br />Said No take it to the border. <br />  ....... To be continued...
Comment8	Honeslty, how relevant is the DUP? They oppose everything and agree with nothing. The party opposed the Good Friday Agreement and are now using the GFA as leverage. It appears that the DUP is anti progress and anti 21st century. I think they are still living in Queen Vitcoria&#39;s reign. Even Boris Johnson threw them under the bus so what does that tell you? Answer: the party is rapidly becoming irrelevant. Their own &#39;Union&#39; shafted them. Seems like the rest of the UK aren&#39;t really interested in them.
Comment9	The DUP are the most anti-Irish and anti-catholic grouping on the planet outside of the Klu Klux Klan. The essential basis of most of their polices is - &quot;If the Irish/catholics are for it, then we are against it&quot;. Nothing more to them than that. Apart from the fact that they are totally psychopathic.  They are the true Borg of human debate. Resistance is futile.
Comment10	Reunify Ireland! It should never have been carved up and part of the UK!<br /><br /><br />And I say that as an Englishman!
Comment11	the DUP......remember 1690 and no surrender.......forever thus!!!!
Comment12	Her nose looks like it&#39;s carved out of wood.
Comment 12.1	Pinocchio has nothing on her
Comment13	DUP supporters: &quot;Sure, we&#39;re British, so we are!&quot; lol
Comment14	Religion has no place in a secular government.
Comment15	Protecting babies is so passe. It is far more progressive to duhmanise them and rip them to pieces. Sticking anything up your arse and parading afterwards is so   hip and fashionable. Come on DUP move with the times, embrace child killing and fat purple haired lesbians and effete non binaries! Shame, shame on the DUP.
Comment16	God bless the DUP.
Comment17	The fact that this is 1 day old and people in the uk still need told who the DUP are. No wonder you treat NI as an after thought
Comment18	"Please share share share your country depends on it <a href=""https://youtu.be/3XaxhxNuNM0"">https://youtu.be/3XaxhxNuNM0</a>"
Comment19	Bojo evil EU bad deal. No to bad deal. No to bad deal. No to bad deal. No
Comment20	So basically, their support was bought by May, a form of blackmail. And I read in the comments below that they don&#39;t represent a majority in NI either. The mind boggles that they can then hold the UK as a whole to ransom by refusing to back a deal. Proves again that Brexit in politicians&#39; eyes is not about the UK&#39;s future, but about their own party-political interests. Shameful and utterly shameless.
Comment 20.1	Btw... you wrote shameful and utterly shameless. Those are opposites lol moron
Comment 20.2	It&#39;s called coalition... it&#39;s a pretty normal part of democracy. Parties join to get a majority so they literally do have support. And yes they can hold up the deal considering it negatively affects NI. Leave votes from ni count the same as English ones
Comment21	The dup are the political wing of the Seventeenth Century. Characterized by sedition and obstructionism. Been subverting democracy for over a century now with threats of violence. And corrupt as fuck. Did I mention that they feed on the rotten corpse of bigotry? And are currently meeting with known serial killers? A deal with the dup is a deal with the Devil, just in case you haven&#39;t already figured that out.
Comment22	Second son players will remember the dupes
Comment23	D.U.P MEANS Driving Under Poison. Doris u loser, u made bad deal.üëàüëÄ
Comment24	BBC..The biggest Leeches in the world (aside from Harry and Meg). We, The BBC, shall extract money directly from the Plebs that we abuse on a daily basis. If you fail to pay, we shall harass you to the point of which you will want your life to end. Make your own money, BBC. You are filth and Scum. The possibility that you might not be able to make it with a subscription only services only proves that you have to rob people to exist. BBC are Gaslighting (I hate that term, but it fits) the working class and Brexit Voters. We are payin to be Shat upon, all hail the wonderful freedom of the United Kingdom (Fanfare). I want back every Penny I&#39;ve ever paid you! It&#39;s only fair I&#39;d say.
Comment25	&#39;The Earth is 6000 years old&#39; - The DUP
Comment 25.1	@JC JC Thanks for your reply JC.<br />I speak with (forked) tongue in cheek!üòéü§£üá™üá∫üçªüçπ<br />Maybe ! Maybe ! Maybe !üòÇüçπü•Çüé∞
Comment 25.2	@Pkia 1050 The DUPs beliefs about the age of Earth, must tell thinkers everywhere that they are (to say the least) away with the fairies, their fascination with William of Orange( also a European, by the way), and 1690, (The Glorious Twelfth) which by the way is held sacred by the (  British Gentry) as the day they shoot specially bred Pheasants, for sport ! not to be mistaken for hundreds of Bowler hatted, sash wearing, Lambeg drum beating, flute tooting, deranged looking, McDougals Flour advertisements lookalikes. Yes, ulster can say No for as long as it likes, it makes no difference, your (in your opinion) fellow countrymen in Britain have said Yes, to a border in the Irish Sea, in other words, you have served your purpose, (DUP) YOUR VOTES ARE NO LONGER NEEDED. So even to people who believe that the earth is 6,000 yrs old, it must have crossed your collective minds that your time is up.
Comment 25.3	The Earth came of age in 1690!<br />Remember the &#39;GLORIOUS TWELFTH &#39;!<br />Ulster still says NO!
Comment 25.4	Sticking a cock up another man&#39;s shit filled a  hole is so fashionable = progressives.
Comment 25.5	Not many people know that.!!! Outside the Six Counties. These are the people who the Conservative Government rely on.
Comment26	They are the underbelly of the uk. Medieval slime pigs. The most embarrassing part of this national embarrassment
Comment 26.1	@Bucket with a face on it as a southern Irish nationalists  I&#39;d  prefer the DUP over communist child killing nonces scam fein.
Comment 26.2	So I suppose killing babies and wearing  ass less leather chaps  is just so progressive.
Comment27	Tell dup it&#39;s too late for any changes now. Without your changes it will still go ahead.
Comment28	The DUP is the political wing of the Free Presbyterian Church, founded by the late unlamented Ian Paisley senior, who was constantly in a state of mouth-foaming rage against Catholicism and thought that the EU was a Catholic plot to depose the queen of England. The DUP was heavily connected to the Protestant terrorist group the UDA, and was the ONLY group in Northern Ireland to oppose and campaign against the Good Friday Treaty which finally brought peace to NI after 30 years of political and religious violence. But they changed their tune and participated in the NI assembly when they realized they could line their pockets with it - the Cash for Ash scandal. When this came to light, it caused the collapse of the Assembly and NI has had no local government ever since. The DUP is also against marriage equality, women&#39;s rights and the teaching of evolution. It&#39;s outrageous that this fringe extremist anti-democratic group has been given so much control and the ability to hold the whole EU hostage.
Comment29	The DUP were unaware of Special Order 937 as they did not have access to emergency override 100375.<br />They realised too late they were expendable.
Comment30	To answer the question directly, they are basically the ruling party from &quot;The Handmaid&#39;s Tale&quot;
Comment 30.1	This deserves more likes.
Comment31	Is she a boxer.
Comment32	Boris the master tactician. He got the Irish to ditch the insistence on backstop which shows he softened the EU allowing him to look reasonable. He then set those useful idiots in the DUP on the warpath, with enough nasties in the proposed deal to scupper its chances in Westminster. All while making Corbyn look totally mean spirited and peripheral. Vote is destined to fail, meaning BJs no deal plan will succeed. Utterly reckless but immense all the same
Comment 32.1	@Ulster Scots Man<br /> Oh dear. A party that believes the earth is 6000 years old can convince itself of anything I suppose. <br />DUP = Delusional Unionist Party
Comment 32.2	The DUP are in on it, and have been from the start, ye muppet.
Comment33	You cant spell Duped without DUP üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Comment34	The DUPs main function is to preserve the union at any cost, including the north‚Äôs economy and the future of its kids. They‚Äôre anti Irish, sectarian dinosaurs the have no place in the future of the island of Ireland.
Comment 34.1	AWResistance: What&#39;s god, is it a magic sky genie sitting upon a cloud who LOVES YOU, &amp; &#39;Poofed&#39; a nothing into something &amp; into everything?
Comment 34.2	@AWResistance Allah be praised,long live the CASH for ASH. and free holidays for Ian Jnr. GOD love him.
Comment 34.3	@Adam Craig Better still why dont they just go home to Scotland where they are from and give back the land back they stole from the native Irish.these foreigners have caused endless problems for our country.
Comment 34.4	Fizzy Lizzie were you born on Ireland? If so, you‚Äôre Irish!üòâ
Comment 34.5	Dixie Normous that‚Äôs the mind set invasion will instill. I wonder would that be the way the British felt if the nazis had invaded in the 40‚Äôs?
Comment35	Arlene Foster Looks like Ricky Hatton after 10 Rounds!!
Comment 35.1	Rachel Taaffe good luck üëç
Comment 35.2	Fizzy Lizzy Somehow, being nice sounds easier said than done!! I know I‚Äôve failed on that front. I really need to incorporate positive thinking patterns into my framework. Wish me luck!!
Comment 35.3	Rachel Taaffe Thank you I was expecting a nasty reply ,the way I see it is we are all born into this world we are all in it together and it‚Äôs tough getting through the day best being nice üòä
Comment 35.4	Fizzy Lizzy That‚Äôs a fair point and you are right; attacking physical appearance shouldn‚Äôt be considered a legitimate argument so I hold my hands up and admit I should have avoided such cheap and unintelligent criticisms. I know I‚Äôm not much to look at anyway!! Touch√©
Comment 35.5	Rachel Taaffe merely pointing out how awful it is that people attack someone‚Äôs appearance well thick people anyway have a good evening.
Comment36	tried watching this 2 times, but the audio is horrible... the &quot;improvised&quot; recording style is not cool, it is just worse
Comment37	it means YooKai is back into Turrmoiiil
Comment38	Brrexit means Brexit ,  both mean nothing , like the meaningless tasteless BBC shows
Comment39	this deal was built to not pass.  <br />Bojo wants a NDB on oct 31,  no extension.
Comment 39.1	Philip Hammond has a new take, an even more cynical one. There is a serious risk of Bojo seeming to want to have the deal pass and then not pass the legislation attached to it in the transitional stage.
Comment 39.2	@Irritating Git With A Grin Irritating indeed.
Comment 39.3	I&#39;d love to believe what you say, but......
Comment 39.4	I&#39;d love to believe what you say, but......
Comment40	DUP has FAILED to run the NI assembly and now want to  wreck  the BREXIT  DEAL too.  What would happen if the UK ejected NI from the UNION ??
Comment41	BREXIT = Briths will starve....Shame but the world is getting expensive by day whit this decisions....THEY RULE US and for sure we are slaves on time...working for papers($).Wake up guys,this is all for them to get richer and what you get ? Troubles and work +...They claim some extra Gun sales,some ego wars ,and of course $$$$$.What about our Familys our Nature Our PEACE?.....is all world blind they are govern by a drunk (Farange) and a bongo President (Boris).
Comment42	The DUP represent 12% of the NI population. 225,000 votes of a population of 1.871,000 people in NI. They got 28.1% of the vote vs 27.9% for SF in last election. The margins between supporters of union &amp; nationalism is 1-3% with the rest of the population neutral on staying British or being Irish. The neutrals however side with the nationalists on the issue of brexit heavily &amp; are very pro remain EU. So the DUP are irellavent as a voice on brexit for NI. Its very undemocratic to be entertaining their objections on this issue as its ignoring 70-80% of the population on this issue
Comment 42.1	@uildanach2010 haven&#39;t seen 1 party any better in the south full of corruption.. sinn fein dont sit in stormont until civil rights restored if the south wouldnt put up with it in the south why should sinn fein
Comment 42.2	@jaymcaaa they are actually. They formed a deal with SDLP. So a vote for SDLP will be a vote for FF. If the 2 jurisdictions ever reunite, then those parties will merge. Not really. They are a joke party in the south &amp; always will be. They have thoroughly demonstrated their incompetence in the north. 1000 days with no gov. up there. Also due to the good friday agreement &amp; Irelands genuine commitment to it. No party in majority in NI will ever be allowed to take office in the Republic as it would make it impossible to have am Irish gov. impartial in treatment of NI while SF are in that gov. so unless they get an all out majority, voting SF is always going to be a wasted vote &amp; they are a waste of space. They might as well be abstentionist in the south &amp; shut their holes. I am from the country. Live in the country, vote &amp; follow the politics. SF are not the biggest party, never where the biggest &amp; with their latest polling trends likely to be wiped out in the south at the next election.
Comment 42.3	@uildanach2010 fianna fail are not in n ireland I dont vote and I dont believe in sinn Fein to see sinn fein as a joke party in the south is a bit of a over estimate I mean that&#39;s how sinn fein works they like to make the people happy in the south as they tend to vote for gay rights and gay pride instead of bread and butter issues so sinn fein do the same stuff gay pride what&#39;s not to like people are thick ,, and sinn fein was the biggest party if not still is as I dont no how many times the BBC had to remind us
Comment 42.4	@jaymcaaa what are you smoking!?! Sinn Fein are definitely NOT the largest party on the Island. They are a minority party in the republic with a population of 4.5 million &amp; their vote share in the republic has been tumbling in the last few years as people move back to Fianna Fail. They where only getting the protest vote &amp; never a significant party. Mostly they just make a lot of noise. Are a pain in the ass that makes life harder for everyone else, are self defeating &amp; like to take the easy wins or try and credit steal.
Comment 42.5	You forgot sdlp a nationilist party between them they take up 52 percent of stormont and sinn fein biggest party on hole island
Comment43	Cut their funding immediately.
Comment44	I love everything that comes from BBC
Comment 44.1	Get s sex life in that case!!!!!
Comment45	Total sellout. We voted Leave, not for this godawful mess. GE now, so we can vote Brexit Party.
Comment 45.1	Voting leave is what you do if you‚Äôre uneducated
Comment 45.2	You won, suck it up!
Comment46	What a surprise Ireland still a problem!
Comment 46.1	Ireland has always been full of traitors. Scam fein are brits out everything else in including ass-less leather chaps and abortion Mills. The commie filth of scam fein are hated by real Irish nationalists (those who like them also love a good glory hole)
Comment 46.2	Ir just tell the republic to fuck off
Comment 46.3	NI is the problem and that&#39;s part of the UK. Just keep paying the 8 billion a year to NI. And don&#39;t mess with the GFA or you will have a problem Harry the Brit.
Comment 46.4	The problem is the English
Comment 46.5	A problem started by the English
Comment47	Fuck the backstop this isn&#39;t Brexit in any shape or form. Brexit in name only!   WTO NOW. THE TORIES ARE DEAD TO US
Comment48	Northern Ireland is still apart of the backstop, end of story. We can&#39;t risk peace, and I am not too sure what May and Boris (both true) remainers are playing out to bring this Parliament for them to vote on, of course it will be rejected.
Comment49	Get fuckin over it Arlene, the dup and sinn feinn have have held northern ireland to ransom for years, wake the fuck up it&#39;s not 1690 anymore, move on with it.
Comment 49.1	So when they start fighting and blowing up each other, and targeting England again, you are okay with that just as long as you get Brexit done by an incompetent buffoon who is a remainer anyway?
Comment50	The DUP have stated many times that they would gladly sacrifice Brexit if the only other alternative was a deal that would weaken their union with the rest of the UK. They are the main voice of unionists in Northern Ireland - unless the unionist is a farmer or a business person who wants them to accept the Deal. They are invested heavily in their communities and also in RHI boilers. They enjoy very close ties with their communities and with the UDA &amp; UVF - as reported they had a nice sit down with the leaders of these groups just last week and discussed the future of Northern Ireland.<br />They want to remain within the UK and align themselves with all of the UK traditions, beliefs and laws - except for abortion, same-sex marriage, taxation, vehicle registration, drink measures and a few more. Arlene is the First Minister in the power-sharing Stormont Executive and she takes her role very seriously - although the Executive hasn&#39;t actually sat now for 3 years. They enjoy a number of hobbies and enjoy nothing more than having a nice stroll in the countryside - Sammy even used to enjoy a naked run on a beach in Donegal as was reported in the Sunday World some years back.<br />They want Northern Ireland to be a free, peaceful and inclusive society - just so long as you do what they tell you to do. They have always enjoyed a very good and close working relationship with the PM&#39;s that served in Westminster through the years and they always felt some regret when a PM would lose his or her job when they didn&#39;t do what the DUP asked of them. They are the people&#39;s party - the voice of reason - the upholders of law and order - the gatekeepers of the United Kingdom - and not people to get on the wrong side of.
Comment 50.1	Aww, poor Gabriel. All that witty writing and no one liked your comment. Shame.
Comment51	Once the 31st comes the UK is out, all the remainers will be voted out for failing, problem solved. DuP wants money money money
Comment 51.1	@F&#39;ing Alex <br />Of course I&#39;m going to be fine, I&#39;m just pointing out it&#39;s  not  really the 31st as you said,  December 2020 at the very earliest as that date could then be extended by 1-3 years until a trade deal is fully sorted!
Comment 51.2	@Anthony Burke that matters not  everything stays the same as it&#39;s been since you were in the EU nothing changes until after their transition period. You are going to be fine relax
Comment 51.3	Did you forget the transitional period until December 2020
Comment52	WHO HERE GIVES TWO SHITS IF NORTHERN IRELAND BECOMES PART OF THE REP OF IRELAND AGAIN..?
Comment 52.1	"@bucketsandshims  No it does not vanish, what a load of cock and bull. sheesh please don&#39;t vote if you believe the first crap that comes out of MPs mouths. stop and do some research first, the ONUS is on you. <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/280a05ce-f6fe-11e9-bbe1-4db3476c5ff0"">https://www.ft.com/content/280a05ce-f6fe-11e9-bbe1-4db3476c5ff0</a>"
Comment 52.2	@David Johnson Border also vanishes on a United Ireland. Backstop &amp; border both disappear into history after UK break up (which follows a no deal Brexit mess) on United Ireland.
Comment 52.3	"@bucketsandshims  <a href=""https://twitter.com/faisalislam?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"">https://twitter.com/faisalislam?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</a> read his twitter he breaks down what is truly going on."
Comment 52.4	@bucketsandshims  Who told you it vanishes, what a lot of rubbish, there will be delays and checks at the borders. Controlled by Europe.
Comment 52.5	@bucketsandshims that is what I think and suppose but can&#39;t get any English brexiters understand this...
Comment53	She speaks like she ate dog shit...please speak English..Stupid!!
Comment54	Arlene Foster is one fine woman
Comment 54.1	@Fizzy LizzyA Black, Nigel Farrage lookalike, with a speech impediment, halitosis, and a member of the travelling community, with Tourettes, plagued with incontinence, and addiction to winding up Orange Order sycophants.
Comment 54.2	JC JC wonder what you look like
Comment 54.3	Sweet Jesus, you need help. Psychiatric or Specsavers!
Comment 54.4	I hope your joking. I&#39;d marry Shrek over her
Comment55	If they block brexit then I think the uk deserves a vote on the union. Give Northern Ireland back to Ireland. They can&#39;t exist in limbo the dup are either with the uk or Eire. Time to pick.
Comment56	Just another feeding frenzy for the Illuminati, fighting over the souls of the powerless people.
Comment 56.1	@Jacob Jorgenson Same people, same motives.
Comment 56.2	Nah, just a group of Eton deceivers getting rich on little stupid britain
Comment57	<i>REALLY</i> now is the time you do a video about the DUP?
Comment58	No one thought the comedy relief party would be in such a position of power. &quot;THE D.U.P WILL NEVER CROSS ITS BLOOD RED LINES, SO IT WON&#39;T. NOT UNLESS ITS STONE DEAD CARCASS IS DRAGGED ACROSS THEM. NEVER SURRENDER!&quot;
Comment 58.1	DUP: -  &quot;NI Laws must be same as UK mainland, that&#39;s our red line, it&#39;s RED,  VERY RED,  so red IT&#39;S BLOOD RED, &amp; that&#39;s very very RED.&quot; <br /> Gov:  &quot;OK, law on same sex marriage &amp; laws on abortion are now exact same as UK mainland.&quot; <br />DUP:  - &quot;Oh Dugh... Wait.... er....no.... Umm.... Uh... Agghhghh....&quot;
Comment59	That music be like yo, it&#39;s 1995 again
Comment60	What a crock of shit. The DUP are bigots that hate Catholics.
Comment61	Just cut the rope already on N.Ireland.
Comment 61.1	NO! NI Ireland gets 8 billion pounds from the British taxpayer every year to keep that place going. It&#39;s kinda a win win for all the Irish. The ROI would want big money if the Brits want to off-load the DUP. To get anything done and progress you have to have people who say yes once in a while.
Comment 61.2	Give Ireland back to the Irish.
Comment 61.3	I KNOW INIT..!!!
Comment62	Boris Johnson has sold the UK down the river he&#39;s brexit deal is a fake brexit not out of the EU.
Comment 62.1	Wait! You TRUSTED him? Fool
Comment 62.2	IT IS GOOD ENOUGH.. NOBODY HERE IS TOO BOTHERED ABOUT NORTHERN IRELAND.. HEHE
Comment63	DUP are Israel politically trained bigots.  Catholics in NI got the vote after the blackman in America and it took years of war to get it. DUP live on hatred, tribalism and Israeli training.
Comment64	If the BBC believe that they are So Good, then they should stop Forcing Us to get a TV Licence and Switch to Subscription. This will then allow those of us who choose not to view BBC Programs in any Form to Opt Out. If you then Choose to watch the BBC then you can Purchase a Digital Box which will allow you to do so.
Comment 64.1	How does it feel knowing that nobody cares and people don‚Äôt listen to you?
Comment 64.2	Agreed.
Comment 64.3	Agreed.We want a no-fee TV system.
Comment 64.4	Agreed.
Comment 64.5	The BBC is the State Broadcaster, there to inform you of what the establishment has decided for you. <br /><br />All media has a bias, but no doubt you believe everything you see and hear on your outlet of choice. <br /><br />Some of us don&#39;t want the opinions of megalomaniac billionaire press barons given to us in the guise of news.
Comment65	"BORIS. TRUMP and FARAGE!<br /> Saw a cartoon--fella with large manoobs and BORIS tattooed on one and TRUMP on other, above was written A PAIR OF USELESS TITS!

Comment 67.2	@Adam Craig <br /><br />You don&#39;t understand the words you use.<br /><br />Either way,  Ireland for the Irish,  Britain for the British. <br /><br />A United Ireland is coming,  get used to it or get out, your choice.
Comment 67.3	@Arfur Fuxxakes well they are. A person who occupies a country is someone who isn&#39;t from there. I&#39;m native to here

Comment73	Few years ago it was a big joke to think that DUP will crawl out of the woodwork to the forefront of British politics and have a critical say on  the most critical of matters
Comment 73.1	it was a setup by the brits. they knew dup would be a problem for EU.
Comment74	Well it doesn&#39;t believe in equality for Catholics, gay marriage, abortion or dinosaurs. It hates the good Friday agreement, loves bribes, loves being more British than the English even though they&#39;re seen as just as Paddies in London.

Comment 84.1	I would ask for your money back from who ever sold you that pup lol. EU law will succeed only IF the EU refuse to give the UK an extension - no matter what Juncker said yesterday the EU will give an extension until Jan 31st and then see how things stand. Member State leaders were already saying this yesterday evening once they realised that the HoC would not vote this deal through. Brexit is here to stay for a while yet.
Comment 84.2	Alan Saxton hope you‚Äôre right
Comment85	It all began when the Protestant Queen Elizabeth II beat the Catholic Pope at the battle of the Boyne in what was then just &#39;Ireland&#39; or &#39;√âire&#39; and because the Queen won the battle having personally killed over 70 Catholics with her sword while on horseback (she loves her horses)  she owned all of Ireland but eventually the Irish people regrouped and grew stronger than they had ever been before and formed what is known today as the IRA (Irish Republican Army) the Queen was getting on a bit in age and so retired to Scotland, instead she sent poor protestants from England, Wales and Scotland who had committed crimes such as stealing bread to feed their families, she sent them to the North of Ireland landing at a harbour in the village of Larne, they were joined by a small man of wealthy origins called Wee Billy of Orange who came all the way from a European country called Holland hence the &#39;Orange&#39; being the colour of Holland.  This small wee man was so small he had to ride a wee pony instead of a horse... anyway to get back on point he began to lead these poor protestants of which he was also protestant down to a place called &#39;Baile √°tha Cliath&#39; now known as &#39;Dublin&#39; but along the way he was ambushed by the IRA and his wee white pony reared up throwing him to the ground breaking his neck and the rest of his men known as the Orange men because their leader was wee Billy of Orange aka Holland were blown to bits by IRA bombs those who survived made their way back to the North of Ireland where they remain today and they still remain loyal to their past of British heritage, unfortunately their brethren in Britain do not have any loyalty to them in return and well we are were we are in regards Brexit and several attempts later to throw the Loyal Ulster peasants under the bus.  No doubt they will still remain Loyal to those who continue to betray them, sad really.
