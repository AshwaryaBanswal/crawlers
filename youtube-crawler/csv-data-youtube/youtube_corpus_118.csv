Comment36	"I want to know why British citizens want to leave the European union, they are going to suffered .All the rest of European countries need to do,stop trading with them. <br />Britain  broke long time ago, the richest country in Europe is Germany, and France, so when the rest of countries stop trading with them. How the hell they are going to managed the rest of countries have enough money, and goods to take with each other without Britain. <br />They are going to suffered really bad, with all the people from the Caribbean islands. It is a very good time to leave, because the country is going to fall into one depression. England belongings to black people in general over the hundreds of years, before those people came from Germany, Italy, and Spain took away the land from the people. <br />Now they are trying to runaway black people in general out of England because they are full of racism, I was glad when my father  left there to the United States. Because I know that England was going to down  its knees ,it is broke a very long time ago. <br />When they exist from the European union who they are going to trade with them, they are going to sorry for leaving the <a href=""http://eu.dog/"">EU.Dog</a> eat their super when they falls into depression, it is a very sad day for England."
Comment37	Finished with this whole brexit nonsense the UK&#39;s political system is pure nonsense you refuse to listen to the people, you refuse to listen to the queen, you refuse to listen to the PM that you put in place -- that is just pure nonsense and I&#39;m finished with it.

Comment43	a win for corbyn and a win for common sense.
Comment44	Now isn&#39;t that exactly how the left operates in America?  They drag issues to a vote,  vote after vote ,on and on, until they get enough dead people to vote in their favor or perhaps find enough misplaced votes stashed away in somebody&#39;s car trunk.. I&#39;m trying to differentiate and it isn&#39;t working for me. To me it is simply samey samey different namey.
Comment45	This the UK´s with the &quot;Fourth Reich&quot; EU negotiated now in the House of Commons delayed &quot;improved&quot; Brexit deal is only a temporary deal that gives time to negotiate a long term agreement controlled way without disturbances to trade and economy. What kind of political farting circus that the possible future long term after Brexit agreement with the EU will be in the House of Commons then, a new civil war or what? Can the MPs even decide who are the Chevaliers and who are the Roundheads?
Comment46	a salty indian will always commenting on two types of news content. pakistan and UK content!!<br /><br />these fascist RSS gomutra drinker always drunk and still whinning how UK and mughal sultanate ruled them in the past😂😂😂
Comment47	Député Britain lost big salary leave Europe place.  eurofacist
Comment48	What an embarrassing time to be british
Comment49	All the parties have shown their true colours. I don&#39;t like the Tories or Boris&#39; deal but let&#39;s face it, its only the Tories in the Commons that are faithful to the Union flag right now …. at least at present...the rest are a bunch of renegades led by &#39;Bollocks&#39; Bercow and supported by the biased media such as the BBC.
Comment50	But, we have to admit, that as an outsider it is funny to watch this whole thing go down😂😂😂 Probably the best show I&#39;ve ever seen, and it surely has a better story than Twilight
Comment51	So they will be with turkey and Germany soon.
Comment 51.1	And what does Germany have to do with this !!?!?!!!<br />Sunil Ipe, - F*** off and join the pathetic bunch of morons, idiots and lunatics above.<br />They perfectly match your non-existent brain!
Comment 51.2	Sunil Ipe what does turkey have anything to do with this?
Comment52	Search for Brexit on YouTube all you get is main Street media videos. What happened to the independent YouTube channels. ?
Comment53	This isn’t real.  It’s an illusion to make you think our ‘elected’ government is in charge.  They are not.  It’s a dog and pony.  The decision to stay was made long ago.  You can’t trust any of the treasonous imbeciles.  Pedos and psychopaths are now in control.  The queen?  Jimmy Saville was always at the palace.  What does that tell you.  Only civil unrest will restore any semblance of order.
Comment54	Its hard to keep a respect for the UK
Comment55	We were conned by Ted Heath in 1973 and so much as admitted it.<br />We never got a vote whether we voted for MEPs in the EU parliament, we were just told to do so or not bother.<br />How <b>DARE</b> the remoaners talk about having another vote!<br />We never got a say on the EU Parliament to start with and EU membership, only EEC Common Market free trade agreement, which was a lie by Ted Heath.
Comment56	We voted to leave, deal or no deal. And am sure, Boris will find a way to get us out. Because if we don&#39;t, the public anger will rise and rise. Just like there was outside Westminster,  but they want a second referendum the people have already spoken for goodness sake. If there is a second people&#39;s vote, then Scotland will want a vote  on independence again !!!! then Wales. The whole of Uk will be broken up, we all hope that we leave this October, as people are fed up.  As for the Labour party, Corbyn will do more than reck the country. You don&#39;t need any more said about him. You know yourselves.
Comment57	well the shitshow doesnt end...at least we have to agree to a further delay. i hope we dont do that. im sick and tired. just leave and never come back.
Comment58	And so this whole mess continues.
Comment59	Execute ORDERRRR 66
Comment60	We let this clowns run the country?
Comment61	This brexit thing will run forever, democrapy doesn&#39;t work these days. Another millions rioters will demonstrate on the streets just like HK, you reap what you sow, Britons
Comment62	Third time already. It is enough. EU should say no and say to UK to get out.
Comment63	These mps are deluded because they see support on social media and crowds in remain London. They should walk around their constituencies if they want the actual opinion of the majority of people.
Comment64	wtf is this nonsense. It&#39;s just childish at this point. UK had enough time and chances. enough is enough.
Comment65	Too funny. Now that all of Europe wants the UK to be gone as soon as possible, the British parliament votes for another delay.
Comment66	You must accept to be a loser ! Deal or no deal you&#39;re still a loser !
Comment67	WE the people of the UK demand a general election immediately, we will no longer stand for this DICTATORSHIP oligarchy!! Parliament has brought disgrace to the UK for the entire worldwide stage to see. It is now time to remove this corrupt filth.
Comment68	Democracy is a joke!
Comment69	Circus continuation.
Comment70	One day, at the ballot box, there will be a reckoning the like of which this country has never seen.
Comment71	Please Mr Boris Johnson, take your time and work diligently towards it, if the doors are opened. Next week is not far. From the UK innocent deportee in Ghana Mr Mamadou Bendaloue. Morton Hall IRC and Colnbrook IRC I&#39;m still a deportee in Ghana. One world.

Comment73	"Just a British Scam. They never had any intent to Brexit. Just a scam, time.to.let the Eurotrash eat their own. USA needs to boot UK, Germany and France and find some <a href=""http://real.men/"">real.men</a> and women in Europe that are worth it. Start with Poland, put the 4Sale sign up on the so.called big 3 EuroTrash."

Comment 74.3	@Bilal Khalid Well, we have changed our minds. We dont want to be slave of USA, we want to remain this time.
Comment 74.4	No it wasn&#39;t.<br /><br />The endless delays are caused by Jeremy Corbyn and the other Remainers who don&#39;t want to leave the EU.<br /><br />Brexit now!
Comment75	I dont get it wtf.... Can someone explain what the fuck is going on? are brits leave EU finally? or waht again
Comment76	Leaving with no deal seems more of a reality than ever before, now. I really hope the EU will reject an extension just for laughs.
Comment77	Well done B Johnson, you&#39;ve done it!!!
Comment78	That was funny 😂 “Pretty Close” it was as close as Johnson is to his brother that quit 😂😂
Comment79	Oh bloody hell! Not again! BJ&#39;ll have to get out his quill pen. You know he&#39;s as bald as Thump. New referendum right ahead!
Comment80	I thought democracy was supposed to work?  BREXIT MEANS LEAVE!  If this doesn&#39;t go through by the deadline, people should be in the streets.
Comment 80.1	They&#39;re on the streets demanding to stay.
Comment81	We all new this was going to happen the Mps want to remain and are doing everything to stop Brexit happening and all they have done is shown themselves who they really are.
Comment82	"♪ <a href=""https://youtu.be/EylsjEqvNKQ"">https://youtu.be/EylsjEqvNKQ</a><br />or rather<br />♪ <a href=""https://youtu.be/lwjkbdHV7RQ"">https://youtu.be/lwjkbdHV7RQ</a><br />?"
Comment83	The big theater live.
Comment84	There is doubtfully a version of brexit that would satisfy even 50% of people across the country, as our opinions are so different from each other on almost every different subject. I voted for Brexit. However, I&#39;m a centre-left and a Corbyn fan. I voted for Scottish Independence for the same reason as Brexit which was sovereignty and autonomy. Don&#39;t care for Nigel Farage or the 350 million for the NHS (none of that allured me in the first place) but I didn&#39;t vote for Boris n his pals to pull this kind of stunt. What&#39;s next? They sh*t on the Queen? <b>Massive increase in the polls</b>
Comment85	"Parliament will as ALWAYS do the only thing they do: vote against<br />The UK will as ALWAYS ask for an extension, and after that another and another and.....ad infinitum<br />to coward, to egocentric and to idiotic to do anything"
Comment86	corbyn the clown,what a prick!
Comment87	bbc on tv after one advertisement increase the no numbers then run two more advertisements
Comment88	Fuck the future generations of Britain, let&#39;s just get it done <br /><br />Weeeeeeeyyyyyuuuuuehhhhhheyyuuuuuueyyyyyyyu
Comment89	Doesn&#39;t anyone realize that there will be no Brexit
Comment90	"İlham Əliyev dictator help us <a href=""https://youtu.be/osUNxRHfYkM"">https://youtu.be/osUNxRHfYkM</a>"
Comment91	It is imposible to move on if the labour party insists in rejecting every deal without giving any better suggestion. Evidently this issue has been reduced to  an absurd strength competition between parties.
Comment92	Arhhh Aaaai said captain Bird&#39;s Eye
Comment93	1 like = 1% chance of Guy Fawkes being revived and succeeding entirely
Comment94	General Election!!!
Comment95	This bullshi*t storm is making Boris Johnson ill.
Comment96	NO DEAL PLEASE. Its what I voted for.
Comment 96.1	The losing side? Yeah that doesn’t count, luv.
Comment97	Yang nonton floating smua 😂😂😂😂
Comment98	Orderrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Comment99	Noone in parliament has read the deal yet. So all arguments are void. They need to read it first then discuss each issue in the deal. They need to involve businesses to voice their opinions on the new deal. It is unfair and unwise to rush this deal through. I think what will happen is the deal will be voted down, and then a general election will be used to clarify the people&#39;s needs. Unless we can get Harry Potter in to wave his magic wand. Are you out there Harry?
Comment 99.1	Tumble weed
Comment100	Oar-duuuuuuhhhhrrr...oar-duuuuuuhhhrrrr
Comment101	Ted Heath TRICKED the UK electorate into joining the EEC ( Common Market ) back in 1973.<br />Then later on we had the European Parlament appear out of nowhere and WITHOUT A MANDATE FROM THE BRITISH PEOPLE.<br />WHY didn&#39;t we get a say on that?<br />We have been tricked and lied to and denied a vote on several occasions before.<br />This time we GOT a vote and certain people don&#39;t like it.
Comment102	Labour have absolutely no idea what is coming to them! Worst thing me and my family ever did was to vote Labour. Never ever again. Corbyn is a lunatic.
Comment 102.1	well said mate,they are finished!
Comment103	thank you .
Comment104	Please usa invade us and put up a better democracy
Comment105	"I voted out.  But now since i learned so much over the past 3 years, I want to vote again.  And I want to remain in Europe. <br />Please, give me and the Country another chance to decide again, now that we are all better educated on the matter."
Comment 105.1	@eric lovelace Why is changing your mind in light of the last three years an odd thing for Brexiteers? Democracy is based on intellectual and a gradual informative response to the current situation.
Comment 105.2	@Nigel Thomas<br /><br />Put a sock in it Trotsky.
Comment 105.3	@O&#39;Kane - Neither can I.  But it is heading more now, in that direction.
Comment 105.4	@eric lovelace - That&#39;s only your opinion. And for your information, and instead of lowering yourself to bad language, im telling you the truth!   Im no more fake, than your mother.

Comment107	Brexit, the gift that keeps on giving ...
Comment 107.1	​@Thomas Headley  Machiavelli knew more about trade than Adam Smith? How do you know? Judging by his extant oeuvre you are patently wrong, and anyway, name dropping plus Kipper crap is just Kipper crap.
Comment 107.2	The giving will stop when the separation is complete. Lost leverage. No such thing as free trade or fair trade. Machiavelli knew more about trade than Adam Smith.
Comment108	About time the monarchy did its job - hurry up your majesty, step in and enforce the deal.
Comment 108.1	Not permitted. Advise only, with most regret. Just don&#39;t cut their allowance.
Comment109	if not british, if Bangladesh, it’s a matter of minute to pass this,we Bangladeshi,we are very smart nation😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀

Comment110	All Europe are waiting for brexit
Comment111	Lmfao is this a SNL sketch or not
Comment 111.1	Even they know not to touch this fiasco. Thump is juice enough.
Comment112	How many Regenerations does each monarch give to the PM?<br /><br />I counted 14 Regenerations and I think there&#39;s another coming soon.
Comment 112.1	Boris Johnson would beat The Doctor in a fight and he wants to use the TARDIS to get Brexit done
Comment113	1. Parliament will not be sovereign - UK still to be governed by existing and new laws of the ECJ – a foreign court – and<br />with no say over these laws. [WA articles 4, 87, 89 and 127, PD para 131]<br />2. Demands payment of a sum to be decided by the EU - Minimum £39 billion but this is likely to increase and the<br />EU decides the final sum. This must be paid BEFORE any trade deal is agreed. [WA articles 138-144, and 152-155]<br />3. No trade deal with EU – Not included as this is just a divorce treaty. Any EU trade deal must ensure “a level playing field<br />for open and fair competition” and “deep regulatory and customs cooperation”. This will make it difficult for the UK to reduce<br />non-tariff barriers in trade deals with USA, Australia, China, etc. [PD paras 17 &amp; 21]<br />4. Prevents independent tax policy - Political Declaration still obliges UK to adopt a future relationship which will impose<br />EU State Aid rules and “relevant tax matters” on the UK. EU specifically intends to curb UK’s ability to have “harmful tax<br />practices”. Withdrawal Treaty also applies EU law to UK during transition period - allowing EU to sue UK, including infringement<br />proceedings for as yet unidentified breaches of State Aid rules and billions in VAT on commodity derivative transactions dating<br />back to 1970s. [PD para 77, WA articles 86, 93, 127].<br />5. Restricts independent foreign policy - UK to be bound by international agreements concluded by the EU despite<br />having no influence in their negotiation during the transition period and must “refrain, during the transition period, from any<br />action... which is likely to be prejudicial” to the interests of the EU. [Articles 129(3) and (6)].<br />6. Prevents independent military action – UK permanently stopped from taking “any action likely to conflict with or<br />impede” EU’s foreign policies. Critical parts of section on foreign policy and security are not reciprocal, eg future relationship will<br />not “prejudice the decision-making autonomy of the EU” but no such language for UK – only permitted to “maintain the right<br />to determine how [to respond] to any invitation to participate in operations or missions”. Also, parties “agree to consider”<br />security collaboration in European Defence Agency, European Defence Fund, and PESCO “to the extent possible under [EU law]”<br />which is prescriptive (not permissive) obligation. Despite paying for European Defence Agency during transition, British troops in<br />EU battlegroups will not be led by British staff officers. [WA articles 129(6-7) and 156-157 and PD paras 99, 102(c)]<br />7. Controls UK fishing – Common Fisheries Policy continues in UK waters during transition (which can be extended) but UK<br />will have no say in implementation or enforcement. After transition, Political Declaration requires “cooperation on... regulation<br />of fisheries, in a non-discriminatory manner” - code for continuing current arrangements for EU access to UK waters. Any trade<br />deal to “ensure service providers and investors are treated in a non-discriminatory manner, including with regard to<br />establishment” - prevents UK protecting quotas from EU purchase. [PD paras 29 and 72]<br />8. Replaces one EU Commission with another - New body established with “powers equivalent to those of the<br />European Commission”. UK must accept exclusive jurisdiction of Arbitration Panel and judgments of ECJ. Grants EU officials<br />criminal immunity and exemption from UK tax. Imposes gagging order on UK which must keep all EU information confidential<br />but EU can use UK information as it sees fit. [WA articles 74, 101, 104-5, 106-116, 159, 168, 174]<br />9. Leaves UK with €500bn liabilities from EU Investment Bank but no profits - No rights to past and future<br />profits made from UK investment in EIB, no rights to UK share of assets of EIB, yet UK remaining liable for risk of up to €500bn of<br />guarantees. UK must let EU bid for UK public projects at least during transition. [WA articles 34, 75-78, 127, 143, 147, 150].<br />10. EU colonisation - makes UK bystander in laws that govern it - UK permitted to send civil servant to Brussels to observe<br />EU passing laws designed to disadvantage UK economy during transition which might last many years. EU could regulate<br />London’s huge foreign exchange markets, impose financial transaction tax that would be collected at UK expense by HMRC but<br />sent to foreign governments. [WA article 34]

Comment127	As an Irish republican I would LOVE to hear the views of an English nationalist on this debate. A mature response would be much appreciated 😉🇮🇪
Comment 127.1	No, you really wouldn&#39;t. I spoke to people I considered intelligent until they started explaining the leave vote. There is no actual reasoning there. I&#39;m not calling anyone stupid, the vote was based on considerations other than facts.
Comment 127.2	English nationalism is incoherent. I think it&#39;s as much a reaction to the union as it is to the EU.

Comment136	The Parlement takes joy in doing nothing....again.
Comment 136.1	Parliament. Improved spelling would help your doomed cause. Better to fail with class than succeed in ignorance. You&#39;ve accomplished neither.
Comment137	I think this tiring process cannot go on and on and so it must end; and let Mr. Boris Johnson be given the opportunity to pass this much more better deal than Theresa May&#39;s. End of the story.
Comment138	the PM should resign if he doesnt follow the laws pass by the parliament!!!!!
Comment 138.1	@benbow7 for what  you have parliaments or MPs to pass a laws then ????
Comment 138.2	No one has a moral obligation to obey any law that was designed deliberately to prevent the British People from getting what they voted for.  We have a moral obligation to break such laws.
Comment139	The Wrong Dishonourable members of this rump parliament!
Comment140	Thats right Boris, tell them to outfit some other snivelling yesmen to the Stasi uniforms.
Comment141	A quote by Eleanor Roosevelt, describes Boris Johnson, and everything wrong about Brexit.<br /><br />Great minds discus idea’s;<br />Average minds discus event’s;<br />Small minds discus people.
Comment 141.1	Great minds know how to spell discuss. Basic stuff to support an argument.
Comment142	Boris tells Europe he has been told to ask for delay but he says personally I don&#39;t give a shit.... marvellous….; whoever wins this is going to be a very rocky period cos neither side is going to back down...even after an election or referendum it will go on for decades.
Comment143	Traitors
Comment144	Who cares what they voted,Britain voted leave this is getting serious.
Comment145	Democracy is not an easy endeavour, but it is essential to the wellbeing of the people.
Comment 145.1	Errrrr.....no. quite clearly democracy is a flawed system of governance.
Comment146	Boris ask for an extention then dont accept it say the dates all wrong either that or get Trump or Putin to sort it that one country in Europe dont agree to extend, end of story all dirty deals and back stabbing are fair in Love, War and big Buisness Then let out law Those Green arsewipes, bring back hanging, corpral punishment, National service and super low income tax

Comment148	Well what a surprise , keep up the good work MPS , you set a great example.<br />£££££££££££££££££££££££££££
Comment149	I have been looking at at Nigel Farages latest offering on Youtube where he reveals what has been teased out of the voluminous document that is the new proposed agreement and it is as bad or worse than Theresa May&#39;s godawful deal. It truly is a case of merely plastering some lipstick on a pig. Then I went and had a look on the Veterans For Britain website where I read more about how Theresa May signed various agreements with the EU giving them control over our Army, Navy, Airforce, MI5, MI6 and GCHQ which remain in force even after we have left the EU. This latter, I would have thought, must come under the Treason Act and also constitutes Subversion Of The Constitution (Bill of Rights 1688 and Declaration of Rights 1688) inasmuch as the surrender of a country&#39;s military to a foreign power equates to a surrender of national sovereignty. I hope Boris does NOT get this deal through Parliament and that we simply leave the EU on October 31st. On the Daddy Dragon youtube channel more information can also be found.<br /><br /><br />Also, what&#39;s the matter with BBC News and all the other mainstream media broadcasters? So far the only person who has had the guts to stand up in a prominent public forum and demand to know what the devil is being done with our armed forces, giving control to the EU, is Lord James of Blackheath who rose in the House Of Lords to demand  an answer to this very question and he was not speaking for long before he was persuaded to sit down and shut up. And I understand he was later threatened with the Official Secrets Act and the police Special Branch, even though this information can be found without too much trouble on the internet. What&#39;s the matter BBC News, have you received a &#39;D Notice&#39;? Why aren&#39;t you thundering from the rooftops with righteous indignation?
Comment 149.1	Yeah none of that is true.
Comment150	get ready for prison, Boris. how does the Tower sound ?
Comment151	People voted to leave so just leave. European Union is 15% of the world economy. So GB can leave without a deal
Comment 151.1	Steve Liberator we agree my friend. People care about their lives and food and home for their family more then Freedom. So if US can deal with China and middle eastern countries other then Iran, then so Can GB.
Comment 151.2	define crazy Absolutely correct.  UK is comfortably a world top 10 economy.  If Philippine’s can handle independence, then what is all this “of a cliff” BS that cowards keep saying?? 😂🤣😂
Comment152	Wow...this is much entertaining than USA Congress. ORDDUUUUUGGGHHHH!!!!!
Comment153	Again, everyone quick to blame everyone other than the Conservatives and the DUP.  It&#39;s a government&#39;s job to get their own side on board.   If this is indicative of the vote on the actual deal, he will lose because of the DUP.  He lost by sixteen - an eight vote swing. Personally I think any deal will resemble the one put forward - whether you agree with it or not.  Leaving the Customs Union, Single Market, Political Union and Freedom of movement for GB and some EU alignment for Northern Ireland.  The moment in 2017 when Theresa May was forced to be answerable to the DUP was the point a Tory led deal was doomed. Labour&#39;s idea of Brexit is remaining in the Custom&#39;s Union.  Absolute lunacy - both in terms of getting their own supporters on board and having a plan that resembled any kind of Brexit.  Ultimately they&#39;re an irrelevance at this stage.  The current situation is entirely the Tories making.
Comment 153.1	​@dave ferguson, likewise.<br /><br />By the way, I&#39;m aware of the thirty year release of &#39;FCO30/1048&#39;, in 2002.  Yours is a slightly a-historical view of the past, I have to say.    Having seen Daily Mail and Sun articles from the early to mid-seventies, it was quite clear that the talk then was about political union - the language used was quite clear on that.  It was clear we were leaving the European Free Trade area to join the Economic Community, after all.<br /><br />Harold Wilson even said in the late 60&#39;s when discussing joining the EEC...<br /><br />&quot;Whatever the economic arguments, the House will realise that, as I have repeatedly made clear, the Government’s purpose derives above all from our recognition that Europe is now faced with the opportunity of a great move forward in political unity and that we can — and indeed must — play our full part in it.&quot;<br /><br />And the governments own public white paper in the early 70&#39;s said...<br /><br />&quot;an ever closer union among European peoples”<br /><br />and<br /><br />&quot;what is proposed is a sharing and enlargement of individual national sovereignties in the general interest&quot;<br /><br />So let&#39;s not rewrite history. It&#39;s interesting that when searching in Google today about that 2002 release, you get the Daily Express and David Icke results.  Even if you were correct, none of that indicates trickery on the EU&#39;s part.  Surely it would be UK trickery.<br /><br />Also forcing countries to vote again - as in Ireland?  One example? There were considerable additions and specific exclusions for Ireland added to the second vote.  Hence the reason there was a 20% swing the second time around.<br /><br />All sounds like a Daily Express approved narrative to me.  Because the 2002 release was kept private (which is quite normal), people go into conspiracy overdrive.
Comment 153.2	@wolfnipplechips Look mate, I know it&#39;s Sunday and you might be at a loose end, but I&#39;m a very busy man. I&#39;m slap bang in the middle of building a stable for the winged horse that Nigel promised me. I&#39;ll wish you all the best for a bright future. Seriously.
Comment 153.3	@dave ferguson , as I said, the DUP and some ERG voted it down - that&#39;s why it failed.  The others are an irrelevance.  I&#39;m not denying that Labour/Lib Dems are playing political games, but the reason this will not pass is because actual brexit supporting MPs aren&#39;t towing the line.  They have their reasons, I&#39;m sure,  but that&#39;s where the blame lies.  Also, don&#39;t presume to speak for 17 million people.  Many people I know think a deal is worth waiting for and understand that the process is infinitely more complex than anyone anticipated.  WTO trade is a trope.  Losing 100 trade deals overnight will be disastrous. Ending up the only developed country on WTO only will be horrendous.  It will be the end of car manufacturing and much of the export agricultural industry, with a 10% drop in overall exports within months. Sacrificing billions of pounds of exports for the sake of satisfying personal impatience, is lunacy.  I personally think his deal is fine, and hope it goes through.  There is a slim chance.
Comment 153.4	@wolfnipplechips The EU weren&#39;t out to trick us? We joined the EEC under false pretences in 1973. Documents were released under the 30 year rule that proves this fact. The EU BECAME the EU through stealth and trickery with no mandate. Any nation that voted against them were told to vote again. The EU has steadfastly refused to reform. How you or anyone else not apportion blame to them is beyond me.
Comment154	Traitors. There is no democracy in this country.
Comment 154.1	Chicot The Jester Those not representing the choice of their constituencies are traitors, literally.  They damage our democracy to betray the people who voted for them.
Comment155	Nasty, awful people
Comment156	Some years ago I saw a documentary on the sinking of the German ship Bismarck.  They discovered that the ship likely was &quot;scuttled&#39; by the Germans to hasten the sinking of the ship.  The ship would have eventually sunk, but the Germans on board scuttled the ship themselves because they were trapped and could no longer stand the noise / vibration from all of the shelling.  Brexit is kind of like the Bismarck.  Someone needs to &quot;scuttle&quot; the sinking ship.  Hopefully, that is Boris Johnson&#39;s intention.

Comment157	Can anybody give us a lend of that machine that pulled those Chilean miners out of that cave  , so we can use it to pull Britain out of the EU?
Comment158	Is this really the thing British people voted for? I’m not sure what all the United Kingdom citizens wanted about the referendum
Comment 158.1	We wanted to leave the EU and be an independent self governing country run by people that we elect and can vote out.  It&#39;s not a lot to ask really.
Comment159	Absolute TRAITORS all of them , no such thing as DEMOCRACY in this corrupted parliament whatsoever  LABOUR and LIB DUMBS enjoy your jeering but its certain most of you wont be able to after next general election , <br />Best part is Corbyn and his cronies think the people STILL support him 😂😂😂😂😂

Comment 162.3	A S Your Brown-washed views are not entirely reasonable. All empires do things like that.  The Muslim empire did much worse to India.  The crimes of your ancestors do not see you go to jail. I do not seek to punish Norwegians or Italians or the French, so you need to Shut up with your punitive desires and rise above it. The notion that I would insist Norwegians “recognise the crimes of their ancestors” is pretty small minded of you.
Comment 162.4	@Steve Liberator <br />England may have to suffer for their crimes. It&#39;s &quot;real world&quot; after all.
Comment163	ORDEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Comment164	BoJo is amazing 😀
Comment 164.1	@Marina Blackview We&#39;ll see when he succeeds. MPs don&#39;t want to leave w/o a deal, hence they&#39;ll have to vote for Boris deal, otherwise no deal will happen one way or another.
Comment 164.2	The fact that a fan calls him a con artist is pretty much proof of a fail, surely. Wouldn&#39;t a successful con artist&#39;s first job be to convince everyone he&#39;s anything but?
Comment 164.3	@Owain Garside He might be a conartist, but he&#39;s successful one.  He succeeded, where no one thought it was possible, he&#39;ll get the deal over the line.
Comment 164.4	Bojo is amazing thick, looney and a liar.
Comment165	Sick and tired of this. Can’t wait to see the backs of these scoundrels. If I was Johnson I’d find excuses to delay any mandated actions and if necessary break the law, accept its consequences, and get this ridiculous Brexit done. With or without a deal. The referendum did not stipulate any deal which is a mere excuse to prevent a Brexit by those screeching scoundrels. We had enough of it in EU which needs to focus on more important matters.
Comment 165.1	Steve Liberator It turn out Boris Johnson is a genius. He complied with the law and sent the requested letter but did not sign it. 😀🤪😄😆
Comment 165.2	Yes, hopefully he will act upon the fact that it is internationally illegal to force a leader to sign anything.
Comment 165.3	My thoughts and feelings exactly.
Comment166	Boris: Can we delay?<br /><br /><br />EU: CAN YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?????
Comment 166.1	@Steve Liberator Cry a river but what you say is lawful. And it is done because your leader is an utter stupid fuck , the likes of whom can only be compared with Donald Trump.
Comment 166.2	@Christopher Blackburn to be homest, I know you are only gloating.<br /><br />We are leaving the EU. Bear that in mind.<br /><br />When this all falls out, remoaners will be hated for all time.
Comment 166.3	@Christopher Blackburn you are acting like a collaborator with traitors in our parliament who do not dare face an election.<br /><br />It&#39;s going to end up with bloodshed.
Comment167	This indeed a dead parliament. Finally I see the logic of military takeovers!
Comment168	There is real brexit fatigue. People are sick of this.

Comment 168.3	I love brexit.<br /><br />It&#39;s remoaners and fucked up MPs I want to throttle.
Comment169	they just want to betray the British people we voted for a no deal nothing else matters
Comment 169.1	Oh not the British people only the  English people as they are the,only ones who voted to leave.
Comment170	I personally think that what Boris wants is actually a no deal, think about it, that’ll be much better for Britain, this so called “new deal” is Thereza May’s deal all over
Comment171	What has become of England? Once a big country and now a laughingstock. Very bad, I find how many politicians Trump crawl in the ass, and he laughs his fist. I always liked England very much, but now it&#39;s not any more the England as it once was.<br />England is going down, very sad.
Comment172	That was a Brexit Super Saturday we saw Boris &quot;The Hulk&quot; Johnson turning to Boris &quot;Greased Piglet&quot; Johnson  🐖

Comment178	It comes as no surprise. Time to wake up and realise we live in a Banana Republic.<br />We have MP&#39;s sitting because they lied to their constituants. Those same MP&#39;s are voting against the wishes of those constituants.<br />We have a broken system that sees the DUP with 10 seats for a pathetic 292,316 votes. UKIP on the other hand have zero seats with 593,852 votes.<br />The SNP have 35 seats for 977,375 votes while the Lib Dems have 12 seats for 2,371,762. <br />The Greens have 1 seat while having almost the same amount of voters as the DUP/Sinn Fein 17 seats combined  Note - These are the 2017 Election results.

Comment 181.1	Oh please no I for one cannot wait to see the  back of the English then an independent Scotland and Ireland be whole again. Scotland and northern ireland  did vote to stay in the EU but the English as usual could not  care less comme d&#39;habitude.
Comment182	This is MPs in westminster not allowing for what we wanted - BREXIT. It is NOT Boris Johnsons fault. I watched the whole lot and it is a total joke in parliament. Fuck Oliver Letwin - They can all go to hell. KEEP GOING BORIS! Until the fat lady sings!
Comment183	They did not vote on the proposed deal, the essential crux of the circumstance. They want to kick the can down the road again. BJ says he will NOT request a delay. It isn&#39;t clear that the EU would grant him another three months even if he did. It isn&#39;t clear they would accept the deal BJ worked out with the Brussels dictatorship. Neville Chamberlain sacrificed Czechoslovakia, Boris Johnson would sacrifice Northern Ireland. Neither sacrificial lambs had anything to say about it. This is what the British think is democracy in action. What a pathetic nation. A plessed blot, a skewered isle, a nobody that is deluded thinking that it is a somebody.  Disgusting.

Comment 184.1	Raj Naveen Yes mate. UK is 17% of EU economy.  That’s between 28 nations. Raises questions around whether they are now overstretched as empires go. This is why they all start popping up and making public threats and demands whenever Johnson queries the divorce bill.

I can foresee an extremely negative election result for all re-moaner MPs,but they all have other,  more important jobs to go to, so they will not have to join the dole queue.

Comment192	Are we now heading at full speed to a No-Deal Brexit come Halloween?
Comment 192.1	Thomas Headley What the EU expects is of little concern because we are leaving.   Whether or not the EU would like to be communicated with in a more sophisticated way- the fundamental point is that parliament is forcing the nations leader to do things against his will, which is probably illegal in international law.  His human right to political expression is denied by a UK law, but UK law is not supreme in international matters.   It is also illegal to force the representative of a nation to sign anything at all.  <br /><br />What appears clumsy may actually be Cummings intentionally flagging up loud and clear the very strange premise of Parliaments interaction with matters of international law.<br /><br />It is also electioneering, Boris flagging up to the UK that he is trying to obey the people, and parliament is blocking the will of the people.<br /><br />The people vs parliament narrative is what he wants, and he just got it on a plate by parliament proving it to be currently a fact.
Comment 192.2	@C G E The EU wants a deal by Halloween, hard or soft. They expect adult behavior. Finance has been slow to move so far due to uncertainty. Rents already rising in Euro money centers. Maybe it will just be a rerun of Y2K. Much ado.
Comment 192.3	Thomas Headley Yes, but Johnson did not sign it.  He sent an accompanying letter saying an extension is a bad, bad idea. This letter he did sign.
Comment 192.4	@C G E Wasn&#39;t an extension just requested?

Comment 196.1	Thats just it, nothing hardly gets done, its all a waste of tax-payers money, I`m a Leaver but I do respect and enjoy the debates in Brussels, Westminster could learn a lot from them, but it would have to be debated and voted on first.
Comment197	What an arrogant pig he is! Is this what his mistresses like?
Comment198	This parliament is an absolute disgrace and the sooner we have an election the better. Let&#39;s kick the snivelling sods out so that we can deliver brexit!
Comment199	All those unelected M.p. Are traitors. Our previous leaders that have passed must be turning in their graves. The votes we had was for the leaders of our choice. And whoever won the vote was in power. Nobody could say, this is not what we want, and try for another vote. We who wanted to leave E.U. Voted just the same that those that wanted to stay. It was law that those that won  would do what had to be done. You remainers must feel so proud of yourselves, being traitors, to the law. Even the Daily Mirror has put in the paper that Corbyn isn’t the right one to lead.

Comment 202.2	Remoaners won’t last long in a civil war. Their skinny vegan arms won’t even be able to hold weapons up straight never mind fight good. They’ll expect to win using their big mouths but words don’t work on the battlefield.

Comment217	The people of the UK will continue to be screwed over by the Embedded EU assets until the extension is abolished and can&#39;t be so easily used to deny any deal.
Comment 217.1	@Mia Keogh So you think it&#39;s that normal?Isnt that how it&#39;s supposed to be? Lol from a historical perspective that would expected.

Comment226	Donald Trump of U.k disobeying the law. Ask for the delay and put your vote, Europe rejects the delay and you get your exit
Comment 226.1	Yes shame 17 .5 million voters get what they voted for ,it&#39;s criminal
Comment227	The Crown should dissolve the entirety of Parlement! Call a full Council of Lord&#39;s of hereditary. Codify Official Sedition from the European Union with no Agreement. Then Start anew a full revised Parliament!
Comment 227.1	Without the eu you would be 2. world coutry. Even in Sloviakia would be much better life than in the UK :D
Comment228	"What a load of crap,.,it simple I&#39;m setting up a party,.we will leave with no deal,then we will cap land barons to cap rent on all landlords and small businesses,.then we legalise weed with real cbd,.,then we let Scotland leave but let them no they will no longer be getting that free money or medical care same with all of Ireland,..then I&#39;d set minimum wage to 15 pound only if they don&#39;t sign up to a union. bloody they get paid so much so scrap it with laws in place to protect the workers,.,I&#39;d heavily invest in all types of research to find cures for cancer but not charge like a 100k for <a href=""http://treatment.id/"">treatment.id</a> make England strong again ,,but no one will back me so I will shut up lol.,,but id make e.u coming back to us begging us."
Comment 228.1	@Crimson Nutcase this my point i would do them things..if people cared more not just when its to late...
Comment 228.2	Then do what all politicians do and not deliver... sounds good to me
Comment229	Excellent deal? Please, my left bolock would&#39;ve done a better job. It&#39;s half baked at best. It&#39;s a deal that is far worse than Theresa May&#39;s and the fact that Johnson calls it great and excellent is an insult to people with any legitimate intelligence
Comment230	Have the majority of the House of Commons MPs lost their common sense? Perhaps Her Majesty, the Queen, should began to use Her formal power and rule general parliamentary election? Boris Johnson is anyway Her Majesty´s Prime Minister and the UK´s Government is Her Majesty´s Government. Queen Victoria was the last UK´s Monarch who 100% used the UK´s Monarch´s formally significant political power during Her long and glorious reign, which was historically the greatest highlight point of the UK and the after the from the UK´s point of view many ways Pyrrhic WWII &quot;victory&quot; practically totally collapsed British Empire, which is today only a fading memory, a lost civilization, gone with the wind. Don´t worry, the Fourth Reich EU under increasing economic, industrial and political leadership of Germany will anyway take the UK back to be a Western Province of the Reich, whenever the UK wants to return and that your ridicule national identity crisis is over. Remember anyway there in the UK that you can try to leave the Reich, but the Reich will never leave you in Europe and Britannia doesn´t any more rule even the waves. God save the Queen and Greetings fron Northern Europe from the partly arctic Fourth Reich EU-Province Finland.
Comment 230.1	People in Northern Ireland have sacrificed Everything to remain in the UK.  BoJo only cares about saving his party from the Farage beast that is watching him.
Comment 230.2	, the border in Northern Ireland should not be used for the import or export of trade between the<br />EU and the UK All trade should between the main island and the Irish Republic directly.and Northern Ireland should be compensated for any losses.
Comment231	Nice one Boris...the people want Brexit. Get it done!
Comment 231.1	@Owain Garside I think Boris will get it done. He&#39;ll get the EU to refuse an extension. Its causing them problems by keep delaying it also. If we dont leave on 31st I think we&#39;ll end up with a very right wing government which isn&#39;t what we need (that&#39;s coming from a leaver!).
Comment 231.2	I voted to remain,  but agree the result of the referendum needs to be acted on, but how is Johnson going to get it done, May had a election and lost the Tory majority, Johnson sacks 21 MPs, both of them have not got a clue.
Comment232	Public vote to leave....... Elected MPs go against the peoples will time after time. Got it. There is only quick laws passed when the Elite want it.
Comment233	"Welcome to the remainiacs HOUSE OF REMOAN to CARRY ON REMOANING <a href=""http://regardless.to/"">REGARDLESS.to</a> stop brexit at any cost.<br />These MPs do not represent their constituents who voted to leave they are a disgrace to Democracy"
Comment234	keeping up the unbroken record of defeat.
Comment 234.1	@Bilal Khalid which of several options would that be? Brexit supporters never agree... each option is unacceptable...a small problem with the concept.
Comment 234.2	@Keith Cross <br /><br />Brexit now!!!!
Comment 234.3	@Keith Cross <br /><br />Still won tho...
Comment 234.4	@M H nitpicking. the question now is how to keep a reasonable trade relationship to maintain prosperity. the referendum provided no answer as to which practical way forward should be chosen. Complex issues must be decided and that cannot be avoided. only parliament can do so.  all actual choices will be unpopular which is why the issues will carry on for decades what ever happens.
Comment 234.5	@Keith Cross Read. I only stated that it&#39;s not an &quot;unbroken record of defeat&quot;, as he/they won a vote last week (I forget the vote, maybe Enviromental rights?) Yes, it will last for decades.... No, we do have a solution, the solution to the question that was originally asked of us, LEAVE. By any means necessary.

Comment239	What if Juncker refuses to grant a delay?
Comment 239.1	Boris&#39;s own words. &quot;I will not negotiate a delay and nor does the law compel me to do so&quot;.
Comment 239.2	@Thomas O. To be honest, not sure what happens then. Maybe the UK leaves without a deal. Uncharted waters. But I think the 27 EU members will not refuse to grant a delay; they don&#39;t want to be responsible for a no deal. They just reached a compromise with Boris Johnson.
Comment 239.3	Jan Willem de Groot <br />Okay, but what if the Council refuses to grant a delay?
Comment 239.4	Effectively, Juncker has nothing to say.  The 27 heads of government decide.
Comment240	Down with parliament betrayal and scumbags
Comment 240.1	@Brexit Buccaneer Bercow doesn&#39;t make these decisions you know...
Comment 240.2	They actually sound smug, like they&#39;ve achieved something.<br /><br />Bercow has shown his anti brexit hand totally now.
Comment241	next GE will be massacre
Comment 241.1	@Marina Blackview The closest we will get to a Trump situation is a Tory-Brexit Party coalition being formed out of a hung parliament...but I have a feeling if a GE is called, Corbyn will get in (possibly with the support of other Remainer parties), and that will literally be the end for Britain, and time to emigrate.
Comment 241.2	@Nitro the former gets you trump.
Comment 241.3	@Crimson Nutcase There&#39;s a difference between voting against the establishment on the one hand, and not participating in the process on the other.<br /><br />The latter is far more dangerous in the long run.

Comment 258.2	@dave ferguson They&#39;ve been clear from the start that a referendum will be called once Boris Jhonson is no longer able to put the days through the 31st and force a no deal brexit while parliament isn&#39;t seated
Comment 258.3	@john arryn Just more delaying tactics by the remainiacs in the HOUSE OF REMOAN to  CARRY ON REMOANING and BLOCK REGARDLESS.
Comment 258.4	@john arryn The most democratic thing to do is have a General Election. But they are afraid to do that. Surprise surprise. They deserve to be shot.

Comment 260.1	scotland too voted to remain. they weren&#39;t heard either.<br />brexit had a significant influence from russia interference it&#39;s a result of putin&#39;s plan to weaken the EU and NAto to weaken the west. Bojo is a moron, a clown and thinks it is a joke. of course he doesn&#39;t care he&#39;s rich and couldn&#39;t care less ... wants only power and attention. if they really wanted to leave and were really convinced it was the will of the people they wouldn&#39;t be scared and afraid of a second referendum on the proposed deal. it&#39;s a SCAM Brits, wake up!

Comment 274.2	Bernie Basset oh Bernie you love a copy paste don’t you lol
Comment 274.3	@R No it&#39;s not.<br /><br />Scrapping Brexit is the only option.<br /><br />According to the government&#39;s own figures, each individual in the country would be £2000 worse off with Boris&#39; deal. That goes up exponentially in a no deal scenario.<br /><br />1. Do you know what the tariffs are on basic commodities like food under WTO rules? They will be passed on to each and every consumer in the country. Not only will the pound be massively degraded, everything would be more expensive.<br /><br />2. If we trade exclusively on WTO terms then we will be the only country in the world that does. Every other country has a trade deal with it&#39;s closest neighbours. It&#39;s a very obvious solution to a few problems. If you share common goals with those near to you then you benefit in all sorts of ways, not just cheaper, tarrif fred trading but security etc too.<br /><br />3. If we leave with no deal, it&#39;s only a matter of time before we start seeking other trade agreements with other nations as WTO is not a long term solution that will benefit us. The obvious first choice in this instance would be to trade with the US. The US has the world&#39;s largest economy and a very extreme capitalist system that puts corporate profits ahead of reasonable living standards for it&#39;s people. If we sign any trade deal with the US it will come at a disadvantage to the working classes in this country. And we will have little choice in what we agree to as we would be negotiating from a very weak position. Socio-politically, we&#39;re pretty similar to most of the countries within the EU and we still can&#39;t find a post Brexit deal that will benefit us. We are vastly different to the US and they will bully us into allowing access to markets that are currently state funded (NHS). <br /><br />The only solution is to scrap Brexit altogether. It&#39;s been three years since the referendum and two PMs have failed to find a way of doing Brexit that won&#39;t dramatically damage the country. Does that not tell you all you need to know?<br /><br />In your opinion, how would our great country be improved by leaving without a deal?
Comment 274.4	seems to be having a long run.
Comment275	Arrogant boris gambling with peoples lives!!!!
Comment276	If I was the EU, I would not any new delay of Brexit. The repeated failure of the UK government to find a majority in its on parliament cannot take the whole EU as a hostage
Comment 276.1	There are no hostages here. This whole battle language just helps get them riled up.
Comment 276.2	All the while, the UK remains part of Europe, that is not holding the EU hostage... So they will probably say yes to any delay as it&#39;s better for Europe.
Comment277	So sick of this

Comment 277.2	New illnes, Brexititis, it will go on much longer I think, unless the EU pulls the stops.
Comment278	Parliament really is a disgrace.  They whine about not having time to debate Brexit properly, despite having had 3 years, and now that there is a new deal, which the Bank of England said is good for the UK, these scum delay it yet again.  They have their snouts deep in the EU trough.  That&#39;s why they don&#39;t want the UK to leave.  Self interest.

Comment 283.1	@Ann Britton <br /><br />If they wanted Brexit, then why in the fuck are they doing everything to prevent it?
Comment 283.2	You do not have democracy in the UK, its an illusion, instead you are toyed with by the British Elites who promoted and wanted and got Brexit because they would have to declare their hidden offshore money by dec 31st or face prosecution. Boris did well for his Eton friends. say goodbye to 300,000 jobs in the next 12 months and the people will not have freedom to roam the world any longer.

Comment290	WHY ARE THEY SO STUPID?
Comment291	Nasty people pretending to care again.
Comment 291.1	@Steve Liberator Down to the failure of the previous labour administration to control immigration to any degree. It has created areas in the UK that are culturally hostile to Jewish people by dint of the overiding religious faith in those areas. MSM and politicians blame &quot;white extremism&quot; and a rise of the &quot;far right&quot; for anti semitic hate ceime because they cant accept that they are the cause of the rise of anti-semitism in the UK.
Comment 291.2	Thom Youtube Here’s another point that I noticed, and haven’t met anyone else yet who realised it.<br /><br />The Labour antisemitism problem.  <br /><br />Very severe antisemitic tweets from muslim labour MPs can be evidenced.  Absolutely as serious as can be.<br /><br />How does Corbyn seek to “resolve” antisemitism?<br /><br />—&gt; let’s blame it on the white males!!!  <br /><br />He pulled up Ken Livingstone for saying what many Jewish families agree with - that Hitler originally wanted to send Jews home and nothing more until later in the war.<br /><br />For saying that, Corbyn disciplined Livingstone on national TV.<br /><br />Meanwhile Corbyn didn’t lift a finger to deal with what comes from the Muslim Labour MPs.<br /><br />Corbyn did it again with another white male, who also said or did nothing actually wrong.<br /><br />Corbyn never intended to stop antisemitism, he just uses it to win points with extremists in his terrorist affiliated support base.  That was all he did.
Comment 291.3	@Steve Liberator They dislike it so much because theyve been told its racist. They are quite willing to forget women in all this who have their votes stolen by household patriarchs under the current system. Then they whine and complain that we need to do more about mysogony/patriarchy.  Truth is socialism is a badtimes philosophy (its only popular when times are bad) and expecting socialists to create good times is like expecting turkeys to vote for Chrimbo.
Comment 291.4	Thom Youtube Spot on again.  I’ve been going on leftie channels to debate it, and they get furious very quickly if the idea of tackling voter fraud is raised.<br /><br />Ironically the other way to bring the voting system into the 21st century is remarkably low fi, involving simply some planks of wood and a piece of rope.   <br /><br />Clearly your way is better 😇
Comment 291.5	@Steve Liberator Yes, Labour benefit disproportionately from voter fraud. <br /><br />Thinking the whole system needs an overhaul from top to bottom. Voter ID is critical to dragging the system into the 21st century.<br /><br />Also the plan to dragoon 16yr olds to vote in referendums/ elections is another transparent betrayal of the UK worker.
Comment292	Looks like we are heading for a No Deal Brexit end of Oct 31st. Downing St have said they will not request anymore delay and unlikely to get an extension even if they do. Last week, Juncker said no more extensions.<br />This looks bad for investment in Northern Island after DUP sellout as both EU and Government wanted this deal. Big mistake.
Comment 292.1	@dave ferguson ho ho ho again the English knowing nothing about history if the Americans had not come in Europe would have lost and sorry to say this Britain only survived so long because it is an island and Ali do no forget all the resistance fighters who sabatogaged as much as they could the Germans all over su5.
Comment 292.2	@Mia Keogh If it wasn&#39;t for the UKs &quot;appalling history&quot;, all of Europe would be speaking German now.
Comment 292.3	@Marina Blackview most of the EU are sick to the back teeth with England and  cannot wait to see the back of them they are arrogant stupid and have never learned from their appling history. Hopefully this will be the breakup of the United Kingdom can&#39;t wait.
Comment 292.4	LoL? Juncker said no? He doesn&#39;t decide sh?t xD
Comment293	Boris is gambler he knows how to take us out without deal well done bojo I know your game plan

Comment 293.2	mr khan exactly, spot on mate.  He also knew how to take your dad up the arse last night, your dad was happy 😳😂
Comment 293.3	Really?   You forget the fact that he was not only against leaving, but was <b>adamantly</b> against the U.K. leaving the European Union.   He is batting for the other side and is throwing the game.  You,and many others have been taken in by him.

Comment295	Relegation form from Bor-arse. <br />Is someone keeping count of how many votes old Eton Boy has lost ? Has he won even one....? He&#39;s not very good, is he ?
Comment 295.1	@Rachel White.  A <b>treaty</b> has been agreed between Johnson&#39;s Government and the European Union, Parliament have requested more time to scrutinize it, .....before rejecting it.  A legal challenge has been made to prevent the U.K. leaving without a deal and the E.U insists that no extensions will be given.  The Northern Ireland Backstop is opposed by the D.U.P. as two jurisdictions and V.A.T. rates will be unworkable. Scotland will argue for the lower of the two V.A.T. rates and another independence referendum because leaving the E.U. wasn&#39;t a consideration for most before voting to remain with the U.K.  And there is the question of the expected role of the U.K. within the European Defense Union among many,many others to be answered.

Comment 295.5	He is against Brexit, like he stated at the beginning of proposals for a referendum.  May&#39;s job was to delay Brexit, Johnson&#39;s job is to mess it up completely.

Comment300	British <br />Thieves and Invaders<br />British<br />The most shameless people on the planet<br />How African Slavery Civilized Britain<br />Over the course of three centuries, Britain became the largest slaving nation in the world and the slave trade grew to become Britain’s largest and most profitable industry. Britain generated an estimated equivalent of four trillion pounds on the unpaid labour of slaves.<br /><br />Britain owes its very existence as a first world nation to the African slave trade. Great Britain’s economic way of life was formed by slavery: about it revolved, and on it depended, most of Britain’s other industries.

Comment301	People will remember those who sought to undermine, delay and ultimately avoid acting upon the clear will of the British people. The self serving MP&#39;s have wasted year&#39;s talking amongst themselves and seem intent on continuing to do so. Let&#39;s hope the EU rejects the extension so this can be brought to an end. With any luck a general election will follow and these self seving MP&#39;s can continue their conversation as unelected and unemployed individuals. Absolute disgrace.
Comment 301.1	Mylo Archer great suggestion, but I’m definitely not going to spend any time ‘studying’ anything written by someone who admits to being and describes himself as ‘silly’.  You need to be grateful I am giving you this much attention and time, you silly fool.
Comment 301.2	@Lord Farquaad No I just simply missed a word unfortunately, silly me. However the point was still pretty clear. Perhaps try studying it further, I&#39;m confident you will get there in the end.
Comment 301.3	@Mylo Archer Perhaps I have, wouldn&#39;t be the first time. Care to enlighten me?
Comment 301.4	Mylo Archer not sure I understand the meaning of your sentence nor the context.  It seems you had some issues formulating your idea and then writing it down.

Comment304	The end result can only ever be Brexit in name only,  all treaties lead to being tied indefinitely to E.U. law(s) and regulations.  And the U.K. armed forces are to be called to heal by their E.U. masters in the E.U. Defense Union when and how they seem fit to.
Comment 304.1	Neal Beard............crickets.
Comment 304.2	@Neal Beard.  Did you mean all European countries have trained together for years?
Comment 304.3	Did I say &quot;EU army&quot;?  So tell me, what is the United Kingdoms expected role within the European Defense Union?   And what is this EU army anyway?   N.A.T.O. and joint European nation exercises aside.  &quot;All UK countries have trained together for years.&quot;   WHAT?  England,Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales combined make up the British military.  You are a clown &quot;All UK countries have trained together for years.&quot;  Your comment literally makes no sense.
Comment 304.4	I guess you know zero about the armed forces. The EU army has existed for decades. All UK countries have trained together for years. What is the negative of simply rationalising the process. The only countries that are opposed are the US, Russia and China. Try thinking before swallowing Steve Bannerisms then barfing them up kidding yourself that you are an intellectual who actually understands things. In reality you know shit!!
Comment 304.5	don&#39;t be so silly, the reason that the UK wanted out of the EU is because on December 31st all overseas money must be accounted for or face prosecution.  All of the UK&#39;s UKs elites with overseas banking hoards, stolen from the rest of the world is still safe, and that was the main objective. Boris did well for his Eton friends.

Comment 309.2	Like British rail
Comment310	Surely best thing to do is another referendum cos it’s plain to see we are going round in circles. Let’s start again.
Comment 310.1	@Foodways Distribution yes... they are pitting people against parliament... they dont really care about democracy and what the people want.... its what they want. Gove&#39;s final word was all about the people the people the people  .  Do the people think he cares about them sooooooo much 🤣 the people are conned..  we will be back in control by leaving eu ...no... the control just shifts to Tories.. . To a leader who is known to lie, offend , ridicule
Comment 310.2	Danny Feller we voted to leave but got no say in the deal. We were conned , short changed.  So much bullshit and nonsense from everyone means we need a clear way forward. The public are sick of it but slightly better informed now. So your point only works as a banner not as a full article. Democracy means we should get to vote on what kind of deal is made. But that won’t happen.
Comment 310.3	That is beside the point, irrelevant and has nothing to do with what the public want or the best interest of the UK. The deal that the ERG tories are salivating over is the £££ they will be making for their businesses and private interest when the UK is no longer tied to EU regulations and standards.
Comment 310.4	@Hawsrule Begin that just makes a mockery of democracy.

Comment 313.1	@Ann Britton I fully appreciate what you are saying but they are voting on party politics, not for the people. The people voted leave. 3 years later all they have done is turn Brexit into something ugly. They did this not us. They failed all of us and sparked the division. The likes of the DUP and SNP would be proud. Divide and rule.

Comment 319.1	Seems it&#39;s you that doesn&#39;t like democracy - our sovereign UK Parliament democracy / opinion polls consistently showing a majority for Remain / hundreds of thousands currently marching for a second referendum.

Comment325	CLEAN BREAK BREXIT NOW
Comment326	I think many of these MPs need investigation to see just who is pulling their strings !!!! as they are clearly betraying the British people. <br /><br />and labour is now finished as a political party in the UK as the British people will never trust or vote for them. <br /><br />so the question is, who will replace them ??? my money is on the soon to rise out of the shadows populist leaders and parties that will step in to give us what we voted for, BREXIT <br /><br />baton down the hatches as I think the UK is in for a unstoppable political hurricane to totally change the political landscape in the UK
Comment 326.1	are you all mental ??? or what kind of people are you ? that want to stay in the eu who give their staff, officers, commissioners, full legal immunity from any legal action while in post !!! <br /><br />get this in to your heads the UK is leaving the eu end of debate !!!! <br />and no amount of treachery from the EU&#39;s Quisling&#39;s in Parliament will stop us leaving. get used to it
Comment 326.2	Completely agree as a union activist and steward for the British engineering firm I work at, I no longer trust labour and now vote conservative the Labour Party is finished.
Comment 326.3	The Last Spartan its cute, but everyone who’s against brexit backs them. They will not betray their country for a stupid, NON BINDING referendum.<br /><br />Instead they emberass one conservative after another, split the party and force them into unpopular situations (i.e. having to ask for an extension). This splits the tories, makes them fight among themselves and leaves labour standing after the shitshow is over. I’m not even British but I just admire the balls and political manoeuvring labour is showing here.
Comment 326.4	They are trying to protect you.  They are trying to protect food supplies and secure exports. They are trying to protect those who need to live on medications to stay alive, they are trying to protect the workforce from exodus of businesses.  We need a deal that keeps our people safe and secure.<br /><br />I promise you Boris will not concern himself with such considerations.  I presume you want a Brexit that makes your life better, rather than worse.

Comment 329.1	@Hawsrule Begin<br />Aaaaw, don&#39;t you like it when you come across a young Leaver?<br /><br />Do you think I&#39;ve been brainwashed into anti-EU populsim by the older generations xD. <br /><br />You really are delusional about what the mood is in this country.

Comment339	ORRRDAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH... EEEERRRRRRRRRRR..
Comment340	Here we go again
Comment341	Typical fascists overturning a democratic referendum result
Comment 341.1	@lenient You just doesn&#39;t understand anything about democracy. The USA has the same corrupt voting system as the UK that is why he became president but didn&#39;t won the public vote.<br /><br />But let us assume that the system is kind of democratic, especially then it is obvious that the leavers behave everything except democratic. Not the remainers but the leavers are the ones who do not accept the vote of the people!!<br /><br />For some reason the government decided to go along with the leavers and chose for Brexit,  but nobody did know what kind of Brexit..a no-deal?..a May deal or Johnson deal?,<br />However, after the referendum May decide to let the people decide what kind of Brexit, they could do that by voting for someone who would represent them in the parliament and would vote in their best interest.  <br /><br />When the majority of the people would Brexit doesn&#39;t matter how, they would have voted for May&#39;s tories or for other clear Brexit parties but they didn&#39;t, the opposite.<br />After the referendum the people were allowed to choose the ones who will represent them the best. <br />But it appears that those representatives take their task serious and when they are sure that the deal presented by Johnson is not in the interest of the people who voted for them, they vote against the proposal. And then what happens...complete morons and asocial people are telling that those representatives are not doing what the British people have voted for.<br />They are so stupid that they even do not understand that the people have voted for those persond because they do trust them more than the liar Boris.
Comment 341.2	@Shrimpy &quot;We&quot; with how many are you? But I see, you belong to the kind of people who have to stick things on everything because it is too confusing otherwise. I base my meaning on arguments not on this childish behavior, so I have no idea where you&#39;re talking about and it doesn&#39;t interest me neither.
Comment 341.3	@ybor20 heh.. Again, 27,8% did not vote to leave, nor did they vote to stay. They performed what you may know as a blank vote. A blank vote or non-vote is not consent in either direction. Sorry to bring the truth of the inner complex workings of democratic peoples votes to you. You could give your arguments on any election or referendum result that ever happened. Least meaningful would it be to lay them forth on the referendum with the historically biggest voter turnout ever to have come to pass (72,2%, 33,5 out of 46,5 million). And btw, I don&#39;t think Britain is democratic at present. It is non-democratic, until the will of the people is honoured. Not your will nor my will, the will of the majority vote. That a person doesn&#39;t turn up to vote is not the result&#39;s fault, as it weren&#39;t in any democratic referendum ever in history, not even when cartoon figure Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the USA.
Comment 341.4	@lenient why they didn&#39;t vote to leave is not important, it is just a simple fact that only 17 million voted to leave, the others didn&#39;t, Democratic means that when there are 100 voters 51 is the majority and what you&#39;re writing is just nonsense. It is how idiots think democracy should be. So the leavers cannot claim that they represent in a democratic way the majority of the British people. It isn&#39;t and I guess you also have no idea about what fascist states are...you&#39;re just yelling something because you have no arguments and you think it that you think sounds great.  You even think that Britain is democratic....You can call Britain democratic but it isn&#39;t. Compared it to many European countries where they have a real democratic system: They do not split the countries in strange parts so one party can win the election even with less votes as the other. Besides only registered voters can vote and then there&#39;s one part of the British parliament occupied by some folkloric figures nobody voted for.<br /><br /><br /><br />By the way, how many people voted for Johnson? I guess that was a typical example of how democratic Britain is. And the contemporary mess is the result.
Comment 341.5	@ybor20 Except non-voters do not consent either to leave nor to stay, and why as a democrat you should place your meaningful vote to assist your democracy at every crossroad; e.g. the EU withdrawal vote, which indeed had the largest turnout of any referendum or election ever recorded. Such percentage-juggling as you speak of could be done to every election or referendum ever enacted, and simply is not how referendums or elections work; in fascist states yes, not in democracies where the people are the masters, voting on behalf of the representatives they themselves solemnly elected.
Comment342	literally chaos lol<br />R.I.P. U.K.
Comment343	If Brussels does not grant an extension they will cause a hard exit.<br /><br />Can&#39;t stop it so Parliament voted to suspend it to try and force Boris back to Belgium. So Boris A.) Either goes to Belgium and 1.) either gets an extension or 2.) Does not or B.) Boris says come October 31 we&#39;re leaving.
Comment 343.1	@Dani Pfisterer he can and will, he stops the clock which is the objective, time was of the essence so that the British elites can hold onto the money they have stolen all over the world and stored in offshore accounts in the British tax havens.  All this Brexit proves is that the British people still dont smell their own stink. Look back in ten years at this day and see it as the crumbling of the UK, the destructon of its economy and the trapping of its people to its shores.
Comment 343.2	@Dani Pfisterer It&#39;s out of Boris&#39; hands. Brussels doesn&#39;t have to give an extension, thus they and those voting no here in Parliament would cause the hard exit.
Comment 343.3	Kip McEwen then it entirely depends on the EU but boris is forced to ask for an extension.
Comment 343.4	@Dani Pfisterer A deal with Brussels isn&#39;t axiomatically necessary. That is why they are calling that a hard exit.
