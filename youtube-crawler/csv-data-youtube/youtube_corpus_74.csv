Comment2	He keeps talking about Russia not reporting quakes. But isnt Kamchatka Peninsula a Russian territory? They report there but nowhere else in their country? Seams skechy.
Comment3	Your Good Fight YouTube &quot;Does Not Exist.&quot;   )-:
Comment4	Has anybody acknowledge that the swarm in Manhattan last week?
Comment5	The earth can only take so much and she is going to start giving. Doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure that out and it is sad.😢
Comment6	To live between San jacinto and the Elsinore, and have family live close the Cerro Prieto and geothermal pipes, it is a little stressful lol. <br /><br />BTW that geothermal facility in Mexico REEKS of sulfur. The piping now is slowly being built towards the East. The government has tried to exchange the land from the people, and relocate them into small villages. People got smart, they want good money in exchange for their land.
Comment7	Soft focus for hard news? LOL  It&#39;s what you say, not what we see, that&#39;s important. Thank you, Copper and Dutch. Mucho gratitude for the eq news out of Nevada. My folks live in Vegas, and I have fam East of St. Helens. ✌♥️😸

Comment14	Hey, hey, hey everyone.  5.52pm Tuesday 13th August in the Bay of Plenty NZ.  The past 5 days have been brutal with rain, cold wind, lightning and such.  White Island chuffs thru it all.  Been quiet this past week,  bit of a shake felt in Wellington and Lake Taupo is certainly getting warmer ( it&#39;s a big caldera). Stay alert people.😎
Comment15	Wow,  they are messing with your channel! In and out with major blurriness! Ugh🤦🤦
Comment16	usBS ARE ASSHOLES they were 5.5 and 6.3 even geoCRAP had them at that but they followed the usBS Sox puppets and downgraded to 4.7 and 5.4 CRIMINAL if you ask me!
Comment17	Dutch, you need to go to Steve Quayle&#39;s website and check alerts. According to the scientist who developed mapping capabilities of magma, attempted assasination,  recovering in hospital out of country, the magnetosphere has decreased by 25%. There is much &quot;they&quot; do not want us to know. Tread lightly, head on the swivel... caution on the lake.
Comment18	Did USBS sabotage you?
Comment19	Is your new video blurred or is my phone messing with me?
Comment20	It&#39;s always really clear but its blury today.  Thank you for all you do Dutch!   🙏👍🌍🌎 🌋😇 😘😻😺
