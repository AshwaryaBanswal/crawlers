Comment5	Clive Myrie couldn&#39;t look more like a lost Londoner if he tried!
Comment6	Jeremy Corbyn has nothing to do with the British people and Christians of England because he is sold out to Pakistani Islamic lobby
Comment7	Nothing changes. The news reports the same stuff as it always has and their gravy train carries us badly, while the train system continues to fail. Whether franchised or publicly owned. Look at the history. Itâ€™s always political.  Trains in the U.K. are a money racket for the rich while the people crowd on a non reliable service.
Comment8	<b>This is not news. Just more propaganda created to fool you, by the BIASED BULLSHIT COMPANY</b><br />These are staged, cherry-picked, ignorant views from <b>children</b> who have no idea how effective or ineffective politics is.<br /><br /><br />...NOT NEWS!

Comment17	BBC bias laid bare by the Ian Austin interview on 7 November. The BBC showed an extreme bias in the Today programme. The tirade by Ian Austin against the labour leadership was given an inordinate amount of prominence. He was given eleven minutes to recite his tirade urging voters not to vote Labour. He is not an MP and not standing for parliament. He had left the Labour party 9 months ago and has been appointed by the Tory government as a trade envoy to Israel. It is therefore not surprising and not newsworthy that someone with a political appointment for the conservatives should advocate voting for the Tories. None of this came out in this interview nor in the news summary that incorporated this interview nor in Martha Kearney interview of Rebecca Long Bailey. This event was mentioned three times in the space of about half an hour. This is totally biased â€˜reportingâ€™ and breaks the rules of impartiality by the BBC during an election campaign that has a short duration. I would welcome an apology from the BBC and an acknowledgment that a serious error of judgement was made on this occasion and that in future such blatant bias should be carefully avoided.
Comment18	Today on conservatives delusional reality: UK doesn&#39;t have good public transit because the evil EU laws won&#39;t allow the government to invest on that.
Comment19	Labour wants to transfer power and money from the south east to the north. Mmmm. Well first I live in the South East, and second, that sounds like theft. Why can&#39;t you just focus on generating more wealth in the North? Why do socialists always have to steal it from someone else?
Comment 19.1	"@Peace and Justice <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4s7jDlqoY0&amp;t=0m06s"">0:06</a> What did the woman just say? To transfer power and money out of the South East of England."
Comment 19.2	Uhhh it&#39;s not to &quot;transfer power and money&quot; to the North as you put it. Instead, it&#39;s about making sure a larger proportion of the budget goes to other places rather than just London and the South East. How is it fair that London gets major projects like Crossrail and Heathrow third runway when they cut funding for improving railways in the North?(which is already in dire need of money) The UK is more than just London and the South East ya know.
Comment20	Lib Dems are the only hope of removing the Selfservatives
Comment 20.1	Karl Rainer Completely fair ðŸ˜‚ Like the lies on the bus you mentioned.  Can&#39;t argue with stupid...it doesn&#39;t understand.
Comment 20.2	@James T - nope the referendum was deemed fair by the electoral commission. Aaron Banks was cleared too.. 86% of MPs voted to deliver Brexit on invoking Article 50. We knew the pros and cons then. We all know both sides lied. Remainers said they would honour the referendum result in their manifestos, but reneged on that promise.. Remember, It was a &quot;once a generation&quot; vote as the holder of the referendum said, (thats every 30 years). Only those that want to give the losing side another shot want a second ref. I voted to leave not cos of some daft slogan on a bus, but to leave the CU, leave the SM, regain control over our laws, and restore our sovereignty. Nothing else. Thats why Brexit is and is being fulfilled. Democracy cannot function unless the losing side concede. Moderate Remainers did in 2016, its just the extremists that have contempt for democracy that are the problem.
Comment 20.3	Karl Rainer People voted to leave after being sold MANY lies. It&#39;s now obvious there should be a second referendum that allows people to hear the truth about the pros and cons.  The referendum was a sham!  But then nobody is surprised. Time politicians faced proper consequences for the bare faced lies they spread. Jail should be an option...then we&#39;ll get the real facts!
Comment 20.4	only people that have contempt for democracy vote for the Lib Dums. They never accepted the Peoples Vote result. . As Paddy Ashdown said - I will never forgive those that dont accept the referendum result. He would be turning in his grave over whats happened to this formerly principled party.
