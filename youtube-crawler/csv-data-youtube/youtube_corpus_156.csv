Comment8	"During the Tohoku Earthquake off the Pacific Coast, Korea supported 300 billion donations and relief items to the Japanese Red Cross and dispatched rescue teams.<br />However, Japan has shown brutality to exclude Korea from its relief country.<br />Japan is a graceless nation and a loathsome nation.<br />You must realize that you are uncivilized yourself.<br /><br />At the same time, Japan is criticizing South Korea for not sending relief goods.<br />Think for yourself and realize. Whether they are eligible for relief supplies."

The MSM has been a tad lax about reporting this? What a shocking surprise.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t already have AML, it&#39;s pretty much now only a matter of time until you do. The Fukushima ELE is now waaaaaaaaaay beyond any possibility of stopping.<br /><br />Radiation is bad for children and other living things. Just in case anyone has forgotten.<br /><br />A mere typhoon? Pfffft. Hardly even worth mentioning compared to the Fukushima ELE.

Comment 95.1	@Dot Merah  Thats the point because we lacks of Cooperation as ONE... IF WE DO THIS TOGETHER SO THAT MEANS WE CAN MAKE THE EARTH BETTER.. WE CANNOT SOLVE THIS BY JUST SAYING BUT WORKS WILL COUNT..
Comment 95.2	@Dot Merah we are different from other animals because we have the brain to correct our mistakes and do our best to protect the nature... We have our decisions which can lead to the development and the continuity of human life.. We should not tolerate our misktakes instead we must do our duty as humans to protect the nature also.
Comment 95.3	Before humans existed, there were natural disasters. So, was Mother Earth warning the animals, such as the dinosaurs?  Do you use plastic, eat crops,use wood products, wear clothes made of cotton and use fuel? Your town, houses, schools, shops, hospitals, churches, temple, roads, etc. were built by destroying natural vegetation and robbing the homes of wild animals. If you want to protect Nature, go live in the jungle and feed on wild plants.

Comment186	"&quot;If Heaven&#39;s Warnings Go Unheeded - I am bidden to declare the message that cities full of transgression, and sinful in the extreme, will be destroyed by earthquakes, by fire, by flood. All the world will be warned that there is a God who will display His authority as God. His unseen agencies will cause destruction, devastation, and death. All the accumulated riches will be as nothingness....Calamities will come - calamities most awful, most unexpected; and these destructions will follow one after another. If there will be a heeding of the warnings that God has given, and if churches will repent, returning to their allegiance, then other cities may be spared for a time. But if men who have been deceived continue in the same way in which they have been walking, disregarding the law of God and presenting falsehoods before the people, God allows them to suffer calamity, that their senses may be awakened....The Lord will not suddenly cast off all transgressors or destroy entire nations; but He will punish cities and places where men have given themselves up to the possession of Satanic agencies. Strictly will the cities of the nations be dealt with, and yet they will not be visited in the extreme of God&#39;s indignation, because some souls will yet break away from the delusions of the enemy, and will repent and be converted, while the mass will be treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath. - Manuscript 35, 1906. Ev 27.2 - Ev 27.4<br /><br />How God is dishonored!5Prevalence of Immorality Today - A terrible picture of the condition of the world has been presented before me. Immorality abounds everywhere. Licentiousness is the special sin of this age. Never did vice lift its deformed head with such boldness as now. The people seem to be benumbed, and the lovers of virtue and true goodness are nearly discouraged by its boldness, strength, and prevalence. The iniquity which abounds is not merely confined to the unbeliever and the scoffer. Would that this were the case, but it is not. Many men and women who profess the religion of Christ are guilty. Even some who profess to be looking for His appearing are no more prepared for that event than Satan himself. They are not cleansing themselves from all pollution. They have so long served their lust that it is natural for their thoughts to be impure and their imaginations corrupt. It is as impossible to cause their minds to dwell upon pure and holy things as it would be to turn the course of Niagara and send its waters pouring up the falls.... Every Christian will have to learn to restrain his passions and be controlled by principle. Unless he does this, he is unworthy of the Christian name. AH 327.1 - AH 328.1<br /><br />As I hear of the terrible calamities that from week to week are taking place, I ask myself: What do these things mean? The most awful disasters are following one another in quick succession. How frequently we hear of earthquakes and tornadoes, of destruction by fire and flood, with great loss of life and property! Apparently these calamities are capricious outbreaks of seemingly disorganized, unregulated forces, but in them God&#39;s purpose may be read. They are one of the means by which He seeks to arouse men and women to a sense of their danger.The coming of Christ is nearer than when we first believed. The great controversy is nearing its end. The judgments of God are in the land. They speak in solemn warning, saying: &quot;Be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.&quot; Matthew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kWSg0V8nYY&amp;t=24m44s"">24:44</a>.

Comment190	"Bible Language – Volume 44<br /><br />Sea Level Engineering<br /><br />Beloved in Christ Jesus Daniel the prophet who was captured by the Babylonians said that in the last days of this world scientists and geologists will be unable to predict the changes and destructions in the sky and the earth and will tear their clothes and run helter &amp; skelter. Whatever they predict will be incorrect and the end will be desolation and destruction. In today’s world scientists, geologist &amp; astrologers were earlier claiming that the end of the world would require millions of years however, now they also claim that it may be in a few centuries so they advised that mankind should move to another earth like planet. Now they claim that the climate has changed, deforestation has been done to create bigger and new cities, ozone layer has been breached, the industrial waste and plastic generated by man, pollution caused by vehicles, fresh water and sea water have contaminated which has given rise to Global warming. They also claim that due to this the icy poles of the earth are fast melting and the sea level has risen alarmingly which may submerge many island and cities very soon. <br /><br />The reasons given by the scientist for global warming are untrue. When I was young I was taught by my teacher Ms.Teresa that the pollution caused by vehicles, industries or fire would rise up and the pollutants in the air would be brought down to the earth by rains and would turn to dust giving rise to fresh air once again. The scientist, engineers and others who in the process of covering their mistakes are prophesying a false news. If we drop a square feet sized stone into the sea it would displace approximately five litres of water however, the engineers, scientists and geologists have created mighty bridges, tunnels, canals, harbours, artificial islands, tourism places by dumping million &amp; billion tonnes of steel, concrete, stones into the depths of the ocean and have made the sea level rise drastically. Millions of vessels like cruise ship, warship, cargo, submarines, coast guards, fishing vessels etc also add to the rise in sea level. There is no information or discussion about these factors which affect the sea level from any <a href=""http://source.by/"">source.By</a> hiding these facts and showcasing other facts these people are hindering the real growth of mankind by preventing God’s plan of progress of mankind which is against the will of God. <br />God said to adam and eve to go forth and multiply and live harmoniously in the world. God bestowed his wisdom upon Man to create and invent things to help him in his day to day living and was pleased with it. But God hated the sins of mankind like idol worship, rituals, superstitious beliefs. The inventions of mankind have been through the intervention of the holy spirit and these are to not to save the earth from any destruction or to protect nature but to empower mankind to fight and stand against thepowers of evil or aliens rising from the sky in order to protect mankind. Man created nuclear weapons however, is living under the fear of the same worried about the nuclear war. However, nuclear products were created by the will of God as the right usage of these can be used to bring together asteroids and meteors which are circling the solar system and create another planet or even another solar system which can be habitable for mankind. These weapons can also be used to grow the size of the earth or use them to either shrink or increase the water bodies in a similar way. Space capsules can be invented which can be powered by nuclear power which can travel to Mars and return in a few days or even create a habitable space there. These are possible only by the mercy of God the Father and His Son our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus said what is impossible for Man is possible for God. But this earth and its nature are not permanent for mankind and many prophets had predicted the destruction of earth in two thousand years. However, many religious fanatics, followers of casteism and geniuses of this world insulted them and killed very many of them. Christian missionaries and evangelists who preached about the destruction, judgement day and repentance said that Christ Himself will come to rescue you from this world and take you to a new place to give to an eternal life. Such preachers were hunted down and their blood was smeared over their countries and cities and monuments were built in their remembrance. <br />Despite their wrong doings now the same people are only highlighting the fires of the Amazon forest, the melting of snow in the Artic and Antarctica, Tsunamis, hurricanes with brute force, solar flares and increasing levels of the sea the leaders along with their bunch of scientists and advisors are lamenting on stages set over high mountains.<br />Beloved there is no feeling of security among men as even children are brutally killed. Christian Missionaries who are preaching peace, harmony, repentance and forgiveness in places filled with casteism, religious disharmony and racial abuses are being killed and the people of those places are themselves becoming witnesses to their own self destruction as the fury of nature has widely opened its mouth to devour them. Beginning from the blood of Abel son of Adam which was spilt on the earth till the blood of the innocents spilt in the churches of Sri Lanka have now risen to worsen  the anger of God. In the days of the coming of Christ all towns and hills will be levelled and destroyed as Christ said to Christians that when these destructions and natural calamities will happen you should raise your chest, lift your head, jump with joy and live cheerfully as there are many rooms in my Father’s house and I am going there to prepare a place for you and will come back to take you there. Therefore do not be afraid of these destructions and calamities but be awake and pray and wait for my coming because like the way how the world was destroyed during the times of Lot &amp; Noah this world will be destroyed. Amen."

Comment260	"Luke  21:9 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by. 10 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: 11 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. 12 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake. 13 And it shall turn to you for a testimony. 14 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer: 15 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist. 16 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death. 17 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake. 18 But there shall not an hair of your head perish. 19 In your patience possess ye your souls. 20 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. 21 Then let them which are in Judæa flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. 22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. 23 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people. 24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.<br />25 ¶ And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; 26 Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. 27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh."

Comment409	"Typhoon  Hagibis  is  playing  havoc  in  Japan  seeking  to  cause  huge  damage  through  rain  and  winds  in  Tokyo  as  well  on  12  and  around  in  October  2019.  Nearly  a  million  residents  have  been  asked  to  vacate  and  move  to  safer  locations.  The  typhoon  Hagibis  is  said  to  be  worst  in  60  years ,  following  a  storm  that  rattled  Japan  a  month  past  in  September  ,  2019.  In  this  context  ,  it  is  apt  to  refer  readers  to  this  Vedic  astrology  writer’s  predictive  alert  in  article  -  “  Fresh  look  and  innovation  at  strategies  becoming  focus  for  Japan  in  coming  year  2019  ,  a  Vedic  astrology  view”   -  brought  to  public  domain  widely  last  year  2018  in  October-November.  In  relation  to  September –October  2019  ,  the  text  of  the  alert  in  the  said  article  ,  reads  like  this  :-<br />“  More  care  may  be  paid  during  these  months  while  dealing  with  or  storing  or  handling  fire  ,  chemicals  ,  explosive ,  nuclear-energy  ,  hydro-power  and  the  like.  Some  health  hazards  or  health  concerns…………..  could  manifest  during  the  year  ,  more  so  during  the  aforesaid  months.  One  or  more  of  such  regions  as  Kitakyushu ,  Yonago  ,  Kyotco  ,  Yokohama   or  other  vulnerable  regions  in  Japan  may  keep  a  note  for  taking  more  care  and  appropriate  strategy.  ………..Hurricane  or  storm  could  also   cause  worrisome  concerns   in  one  or  more  regions  of  Japan  mentioned  in  this  article  before”.  It  seems  that  predictive  alerts  of  this  writer  may  have  been  found  to  be  meaningful."

That has been statistically an exceptionally strong typhoon in Japan, but it hasn´t been the first or the worst typhoon and it will not be the last typhoon. I hope that the local people, who are quite used to those annual typhoons are safe. Greetings from Northern Europe, from partly arctic Finland.

Comment595	Next London<br />The British are thieves and most shameless people on the planet..<br /><br />How African Slavery Civilized Britain<br />Over the course of three centuries, Britain became the largest slaving nation in the world and the slave trade grew to become Britain’s largest and most profitable industry. Britain generated an estimated equivalent of four trillion pounds on the unpaid labour of slaves.<br /><br />Britain owes its very existence as a first world nation to the African slave trade. Great Britain’s economic way of life was formed by slavery: about it revolved, and on it depended, most of Britain’s other industries.

Comment713	"Concita Gonzales visionary of Garabandal: &quot;The First Message - October 18th, 1961<br />We must make many sacrifices, do much penance, and visit the Blessed Sacrament frequently. But first, we must lead good lives. If we do not, a chastisement will befall us. The cup is already filling up, and if we do not change, a very great chastisement will come upon us.<br /><br />The Second Message - June 18th, 1965<br />As my message of October 18th has not been fulfilled and has not been made known to the world, I tell you that this is my last message. Before, the cup was filling up. Now, it is overflowing. Many cardinals, many bishops, and many priests are on the road to perdition and are taking many souls with them. Less and less importance is being given to the Eucharist. You should turn the wrath of God away from yourselves by your efforts. If you ask for His forgiveness with sincere hearts, He will forgive you.I, your Mother, through the intercession of Saint Michael the Archangel, ask you to amend your lives. You are now receiving the last warnings. I love you very much and do not want your condemnation. Pray to us with sincerity, and we will grant your requests. You should make more sacrifices. Meditate on the passion of Jesus."

Comment 817.1	@katsuki It&#39;s absolutely not a joke.  Cetaceans are intelligent, self-aware living beings with complex brains.  The Japanese slaughter them throughout the year.  It is a grave crime against life.  And all Japanese are implicated because they are directly involved or because they refuse to take action to stop it.  This typhoon has halted their murders.  It&#39;s a good thing.

Comment864	So fed up with the BBC these days. Their website is stuffed full of sexism and racism sob stories that serve no point other than try to shout to the world that the BBC think white males are the worst people in the world. As a white male myself I find it really quite offensive. I just want the news headlines I don&#39;t need some anti white male propaganda thrown at me. Cheerio then BBC I&#39;m off to the Guardian, or even the Daily Mirror...

Comment 887.1	@DR MUGHAL you have no clue what you are talking about Islam in Pakistan is set up to hate all the Hindus, Christians, and Jewish people. Islam was a good religion at one point unfortunately that is not the case anymore. I have been to Pakistan and it is a trash country. And I mean there is literally trash everywhere. Islam has failed you (go fix your country first)

Comment 897.1	@Holmes , what of if his poor? And the thing he can do is prayer. If I said we leave million miles is just a saying in my language. If u don&#39;t believe in prayers we the Muslims believe so leave him alone
Comment 897.2	@AbouMariam Tunkara The Moon is only 250,000 miles away. Do you live further away than the Moon? Your distance from the disaster is not really relevant. <br />Presumably this disaster is an act of the god you are praying to, so praying to that god is unlikely to be impactful. <br />Maybe you could try charitable giving. Possibly starting with an international relief agency, let&#39;s say the Red Cross or the Red Crescent. If you cannot afford to give money, they need volunteers too.
Comment 897.3	@Holmes , what else do u think we should do apart from praying especially does who leave million miles away?
Comment 897.4	Are you confident that praying will help?
Comment898	hope everyone is okay

Comment924	🙏🙏🙏
Comment925	God Bless JAPAN.
Comment926	Honestly??? chiming in from Yokohama (1 hour south of Tokyo), the eye of the storm just passed thru the city about an hour ago....my young son and I walked around the city about 1 hour before it hit and the wind was pretty weak at 40MPH, not at all like shown in this video,  it started raining around noon today...and I mean a light rain . . .ALL OF NEWS OUTLETS CHANNELS have hyped this crap up, must have picked the only two video shots that show damage from a city on the coast that was hit the hardest or video from last year... we are on the coast and the eye of the storm literally passed right over us.....I would classify this &quot;storm&quot; as more like a rainy day with heavy winds.  The eye of the storm in now in Tokyo and the rain is the same...at this point, 11PM at night..the winds are completely calm and the storm is over in Yokohama...expecting sunshine tomorrow....it&#39;s almost as if the English news outlets can write and broadcast whatever they want because real Japanese people don&#39;t speak English or even watch these channels.....Don&#39;t believe the hype!
Comment927	Radioactive contaminated garbage packs and wastewater are all mixed and drained out to the ocean without being noticed by any monitors. Fukushima radioactive typhoon will brings all the contaminated debris to the USA across the Pacific Ocean.
Comment 927.1	The U.S itself is the worst radioactive polluter. Almost all U.S nuclear plants are leaking radiations. The U.S Nuclear Dome in the Pacific ocean has been leaking radioactive waters for over 60 years. Nevada got nuked by  thousands times stronger bombs.  Americans are just ignorant about these inconvenient facts.

Here in Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 we had a terrible hurricane almost destroy the island 🌴 in 2017 and the Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 governor and the mayor did not help the people !!! The only person who cared for us and came here in person to help us was the president of the United States 🇺🇸Donald J Trump !!!  We love 💕 POTUS Trump for caring and showing kindness to our people !!! I hope your government is kind and generous too and that it helps its people if they are injured or lose their homes !!! I wish the Japanese people to be safe !!! You are all loved here in Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Comment966	And all Scotland care about is their rugby game,people are dying,ITS A GAME.
Comment 966.1	@Iori Tatsuguchi Thank you for this update, best wishes sent.
Comment 966.2	If I were Scotts, I could see myself get upset a little bit. I mean typhoon were totally expected in this season, so it&#39;s sorta like having Superbowl in Florida for Hurricane season. Us Japanese really want to have a match though.<br /><br />Anyhow, I live far from Tokyo and honestly I&#39;m a bit devastated to hear about the danger because substantial amount of the cause of possible mess is that too much people living in metropolitan area despite the city is geographically prone to get major natural disasters. (So the river gets no room for expansion nor building dams even at upstreams, and too short of evacuation places in each little area so people got stuck in their home until the flood is gone. And all these happening in capital city where everything in this country is happening. Stupid way to build a city.) No matter how the land is unsuited to live, Japanese people just keeps on living there and have Olympic and all sorts of stuff there. I do feel sorry about people living down there but I just can&#39;t take it seriously empathetic. I mean that city is pretty tough so it should be alright.<br /><br /><br />Why am I ranting lol<br /><br />Hope they all will be okay and also for the people lives under the course of the typhoon.
Comment 966.3	Not the case, I am Scottish and wish only for the safety of the Japanese People.
Comment967	Be safe japanese ❤
Comment968	My prayers go out to all those who are affected by this huge storm. Hope folks get to safer area and evaluate in time. 😒
Comment969	I don&#39;t want to be a dick but maybe its for good..  It&#39;s dolphin hunting seaaon in japan now... and a typhoon will save those poor dolphin from japanese Fishermans
Comment970	Greta wasn&#39;t just talking to hear herself talk, climate change is getting worse and it&#39;s having an effect on the weather in a really bad way. Storms are bigger and more dangerous than they used to be and will continue to grow in strength as the oceans warm up.
Comment971	Wow this is very sad moment for Japan our prayer and thoughts are with them.
Comment972	Japan will be back to normal is less time..
Comment 972.1	@Bang Bang hahaha. And that&#39;s why we all hate them.
Comment 972.2	Yes Rinoy, kudos to the awesome and industrious Japanese.

Comment976	Haha.. Nice clickbait thumbnail.
Comment977	This typhoon just pass by northern Mariana island last week. We luckyly saved this time. Thank God.
Comment978	I just farted.
Comment979	This is mean but I have to say it, imagine if this got really bad and the volcanoes their errupted too along with the typhoons leading a complete evacuation by the Japanese people. Wouldnt it be very karma-like if the rest of the world acted like japan and refused japanese migrants from entering their countries after tragedies....or  even,  if the Japanese get allowed in their countries, they get treated  like complete outsiders like they do to others 👀 am just saying. No need to attack me.
Comment980	I am Japanese. I am living in Japan. Now in Japan, it is raining a lot due to typhoons. All trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area are suspended, Haneda and Narita airports have runways closed, and in some areas there is a power outage. Also, about two hours ago, a magnitude 6 earthquake with an epicenter in Chiba Prefecture occurred and I was very scared.<br />I ’m using Google Translate, so it might be strange
Comment 980.1	I am a japaneseeee.. n i love the atomic bombs dropped on us...<br />I loved it cos we commit too many war crimes..<br />Now typhoon hagibis i also loved it..<br />The jaxx are basically a bunch of ids... n i now understand this is called karma lo....l....hahahahaha...
