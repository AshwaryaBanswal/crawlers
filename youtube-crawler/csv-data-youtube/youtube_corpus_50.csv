Comment15	READ AND BE TRULY ENLIGHTENED: Starseed/Indigo child: They are hybrids. Forbidden fruit; hence fruit of the womb, and you will know them by their fruit, therefore their offspring; their beliefs, attitudes, actions, and behaviors. Iron (of angels) does not mix with miry clay (humans)! It causes corruption in the body/flesh; DNA/genes; hence, generation of vipers. Your body is your temple; hence a corrupted body/temple/house; therefore, your house has been left unto you desolate. DESOLATE: deprived or destitute of inhabitants; deserted; uninhabited; solitary; lonely: a desolate place; therefore having not the Holy Spirit of Almighty God, to lead, guide, and direct them in the way that they should go.<br /><br />Hence, Matthew 23 : 33 (KJV) Ye {serpents}, ye {generation (of) vipers}: [offspring; bloodline, hence life is in the blood, the blood of Christ Jesus, royal bloodline, and true/rightful heir and King of the Kingdom of God] how can ye escape the {damnation} of hell? What Paul in the scriptures referred to as corrupted flesh! Therefore, {born this way}; and {innately} inclined to go after strange flesh/reprobate minds! This corruptible must put on incorruptible! INNATE: inborn/comes natural. NATURAL: that which is innate or real; described as unregenerate. UNREGENERATE: Not regenerate, not renewed in {heart} and {mind} or {reborn in spirit}; unrepentant; an unregenerate sinner; refusing to believe in the existence of God: an unregenerate atheist; an unregenerate skeptic; not reformed; wicked, sinful, profligate, dissolute; an unregenerate way of life. They have a heart of stone and reprobate minds and are guided by the UN-holy and UN-Godly anti-Christ spirit. ANTI: Instead of or in place of; the spirit of Christ.<br /><br />PROFLIGATE: recklessly extravagant or wasteful in the use of resources.; recklessly wasting your money on extravagant luxury. Excessive, irresponsible, libertine; degenerate. LIBERTINE: a person, {especially a man}, who behaves without moral principles or a sense of responsibility, especially in sexual matters. DEGENERATE: having {lost the physical, mental, or moral qualities} considered normal and desirable; showing evidence of decline; an immoral or corrupt person. Hence, LGBTQ; lesbians/gays, bi-sexuals, homosexuals, and transgenders!<br /><br />A woman shall not wear that which pertains to a man and a man shall not put on a woman‚Äôs garment/clothing, it is abomination unto the LORD THY GOD! DISSOLUTE: lax in morals; unrestrained, does not care {at all} about morals, licentious. LICENTIOUS: disregarding accepted rules or conventions, promiscuous and unprincipled in sexual matters; unrestrained by law [God‚Äôs Law‚Äôs] or general morality; lawless; [THAT MAN OF LAWLESSNESS] immoral; abandoned, animal, [BEAST] carnal, corrupt, debauched, depraved, desirous, [LUSTFUL; the lust of your father ye will do] disorderly, fleshly, {IMPURE}, lascivious, lax, lewd.<br /><br />(I ‚Äì SAY ‚Äì ‚ÄúYAH‚Äù); Isaiah 14 : 12 ‚Äì 14 (KJV) 12 To Satan: How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou {cut down to the ground}, which (didst weaken the nations)! 13 For thou hast said {in thine heart}, (I will) ascend into heaven, (I will) exalt my throne above the stars [angels/sons (of) {offspring}] of God: (I will) sit also upon the mount [mountain of God] of the congregation, [God‚Äôs Holy Assembly] in the sides of the north: 14 (I will) ascend above the heights of the clouds; [who ascended above the heights of the clouds? JESUS] (I will) be like the most High. [I come as a thief; hence keep my word of patience, patiently wait upon the Lord]! Matthew 13 : 24 ‚Äì 30 (KJV) 24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which (sowed good seed in his field): 25 But {while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares} among the wheat, and went his way. [Satan wholly seduced Eve/transformed into an angel of light and so did/does the fallen angels in league with him]!<br /><br />26 But when the blade was sprung up, and (brought forth fruit), then appeared the tares [weeds] also. 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28 He said unto them, An {enemy} hath done this. [Know your enemy]! The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together (until the harvest): and in the time of harvest {I will} say to the {reapers}, Gather ye together ((first the tares)), and (bind them in bundles to burn them): [REAPERS: angels; harvesters; cut off, destroy; as crops are cut down with a sickle] but gather the wheat into my barn. Romans 12 : 2 (KJV) And {be not conformed} to this world: but be ye {transformed} [regenerate; reformed or reborn] by the (renewing of your mind), that ye may prove what is that {good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God}. Hence; least ye be {reborn} ye shall not see the kingdom of God!<br /><br />Because they did not like to retain God in their thoughts, he gave them over to reprobate minds. REPROBATE: morally corrupt: depraved; {{rejected as worthless or not standing a test; foreordained to damnation, condemned}}. Hence pray always that you be accounted worthy! The wicked seed of that Wicked (One); Satan; shall not inherit the earth! It is written! I will visit the sins of the father unto; the third and fourth generations/genes/DNA/bloodline! Deut. 23 : 2 ‚Äì 8 (KJV) 2 A {bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord; even to his tenth generation} shall he not enter into the congregation of the Lord. 3 An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the Lord {for ever}:<br /><br />4 Because (they met you not) with (bread and with water in the way), [Jesus; whose body is the bread of life and who gives living water and who also turned the water to wine at the wedding; hence the blood of Jesus, and wedding supper of the Lamb] when ye came forth out of Egypt; [out of bondage] and because (they hired against thee Balaam) the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, (to curse thee). 5 Nevertheless the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the Lord thy God (turned the curse into a blessing unto thee), because {the Lord thy God loved thee}. [Jacob have I love; Esau have I hated]! 6 {{Thou (shalt not) seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever}}. 7 Thou (shalt not) {abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother}: thou (shalt not) {abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land}. 8 The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the Lord in their {third generation}.<br /><br />Romans 9 : 21 ‚Äì 23 (KJV) 21 Hath not the potter power over the clay, (of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, [true royal family] and another unto dishonour) [Serpent seed]? 22 What if God, willing to {shew his wrath, and to make his power known}, (endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction): 23 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore [beforehand] prepared unto glory,‚Ä¶ [through Adam and Seth; Noah and Shem; Isaac and Jacob, the real Shemites] God allowed the weeds to be planted in the garden; because of the rebellion of Satan in the first earth age. We are living in the second earth age!<br /><br />Satan planted his own seed in the garden. Seed is offspring/children. He/Satan wants to be worshiped as god, yet he is no god, but a mere angel, the {created not the creator}; whom tampered with God‚Äôs creation! Your body is your temple for the Holy Spirit of God. Spiritual battle/war. Their bodies/temples, are wide open to receive wickedly evil demonic spirits; anti-Christ spirit. So ye Serpents; how can ye escape the damnation of hell? Through much interbreeding down through the years, breeding out the serpent seed, you can repent and call upon the name of the LORD!
