Comment1	Ahh,,,,what a difference a year makes. The only friends on this planet that the dup have are the Tories. The dup are anti-Labour, anti-SNP, anti-Lib Dems, anti-Irish, anti humanitarians, anti-Catholic, anti-American, anti-European, anti-human rites anti etc, etc, etc. What they are, are pro sectarian, pro anarchy, pro Monarchy, pro-capitalist (against the working and non-working classes) pro career politicians, pro-jobs for the boys, etc, etc, etc and so on and on. They are stuck in the 1600s. They are the bain of the ordinary working-class Loyalist people who are so desperately seeking a better life for their children. The DUP and their lackeys the Tories are doing absolutely nothing to help the working classes progress. In fact, they are consistently holding that group of British citizens, whom they so adamantly claim to be helping, in the poverty, they have been born into. Where do they stand today? At a cliff edge, staring disaster in the eye!. One can not get a better example of being stuck &quot;between a rock and a hard place&quot;. The only way they can go from here is almost certainly negative. If there was a general election in the morning, just take a moment to think about the possible outcomes,,, Labour gets a majority government. The dup are anti-Labour/Corbyn and will get thrown under the bus. The Tories get a majority? they really will be thrown under the bus (maybe, many buses?) as their ten votes would be null and void. A hung parliament? The best outcome for the dup. They could hold the balance of power and have great influence and so strengthen the Union. Well God damn it! that&#39;s what we already have and what benefit has the dup gained? Well, as fate would have it, they have put their beloved union in jeopardy and were thrown under the Boris bus. You couldn&#39;t make it up. Boris is a career politician, just like the dup members all are. Self-centred, only concerned with their own legacies at the expense of their constituents whom they claim to look after. They have dug their own graves. Their only friend on the planet has done them over. Need I say more?
Comment2	Ignorant or, direct racism are both disgusting.<br /><br />Why has the BBC not covered the wholy unacceptable racist comment that Lottie made from the Apprentice.<br /><br />Furthermore, why has there been no action taken against her!?
Comment3	Another bias view by the BBC through the brown envelope scheme. Lol
Comment4	You mean theresea mays deal now agreed
Comment5	.The gutter bbc and rotten to the core 2 Party system, along with its Treasonous Political class, along with 80 % of the UK Media and the the house of snakes its all over for their Orwellian, Deep State, Illuminate agenda and their reprehensible philosophy, its like watching a snakes that have swallowed their own poison/venom, they writhe and twist before the inevitable..Vote BREXIT Party at the next GE.... DRAIN THE SWAMP
Comment6	Well, folks, we were all fooled AGAIN! ,I really thought Boris would get us out of this shit and go down in history as our  saviour, and giving us Independence away from the EU &quot; but no just more traitor to add to the list,  there is going to be so much civil unrest, at the moment we are like a boiling vessel with a tight lid.
Comment7	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiOc9mZs1QGhI711IKItYUA"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiOc9mZs1QGhI711IKItYUA</a>"
Comment8	BBC, why don&#39;t you like democracy?
Comment9	First of all from what I remember his party wanted to remain isn&#39;t it? It was Corbyn who wanted to leave in the first place. Then the Conservatives put a referendum, Nigel Farage steps in telling lies getting people to vote to leave. Conservatives never wanted to leave the EU and they won&#39;t neither with Boris nor anyone else. To believe that such irresponsible behaviour was made by the Conservative party who put the UK in a very dangerous position. The Conservative party should have predicted that this was going to happen. They just didn&#39;t do their job. The Conservative party doesn&#39;t want and won&#39;t leave the EU after all that&#39;s what Nigel is telling about this new deal they have now. I quote him its 95 percent the same as Theresa mays agreement. What they try to save desperately both parties not only the Conservatives but Labour too is the great mess they both put their parties in. They literally try to save their parties nothing else. They are both responsible for the uprising of the far right in the UK. They should have both predicted all of this mess. If Boris will somehow do a deal it won&#39;t be a brexit deal. Everything will remain the same it will just be a load of agreements but life will be pretty much the same. Its just a whole lot of drama that kind of drama far right girls like. Boris will just try to get that far right sympathy and do them a supposedly brexit deal maybe then they can shut up that&#39;s his plan. But they won&#39;t. You have opened the Pandoras box and I can assure you Nationalism is not an easy snake to kill. Especially if that kind of snake is in this country. The Far right has your balls Boris you act like you are the greatest thing this country has right now but you are not. And as for Labour do us a favour and find your self another leader would you? I&#39;m sure they already have thoughts about it.
Comment10	Bojo evil viral deal. No No No to Bojo treason deal . No
Comment11	Having another vote to include all the options is the most democratic thing one should do for the sake of the people. Should include a vote of no confidence against all politicians in parliament and even the house of lords. The people after all is why we have a government in the first place. Of course we should not call it a government as we should not be subjects or the governed.
Comment12	Protecting EU laws in Ireland üòÇ thought we was leaving the EU so why the EU still have laws in the UK ü§î Jo Swindon said Boris Johnson is rushing it! üòÇ this has been going on for three and a half years..
Comment13	Northern Ireland is a part of the UK, not an EU colony. Fuck this shit treaty.
Comment14	No deal this is still Theresa May&#39;s deal
Comment15	I long to see this disgusting pseudo parliament blown up and razed to the ground
Comment 15.1	@Paul Rhu-Mhor Fraser Not all powerful actually-blocked by a Supreme Court smuggled in by Cameron and suffereing from a biased Speaker who ind efiance of constituitonal tradition is not disinterested. Furthermore until Brexit is completed, the UK palriament is by deffinition not all powerful. Long to see the European parliament destroyed quite apart from whatever happens in Britain. the strasbourg parliament is waste of money and hideous as a building. It is useless.
Comment 15.2	@Paul Rhu-Mhor Fraser &quot;An unmovable parliament is more obnoxious than an unmovable king&quot;
Comment 15.3	you wanted an all-powerful¬†UK Parliament didn&#39;t  ¬†you? There you go!!!
Comment16	Government definition : A group of humans with the authority to govern a country or state<br /><br />The whole system. Words can&#39;t describe how much I hate it. I can&#39;t accept it. The government does NOT have authority over me. Authority isn&#39;t even a real thing. IT&#39;S AN ABSTRACT CONCEPT <br /><br />ACTUAL government definition : A group of complete delusional idiots who somehow and unfortunately have the &quot;authority&quot; to force their stupid little rules on every single individual on the land
Comment17	Every day I have to cope with so much anger and hatred, and it&#39;s because of how much I hate human society. The &quot;government&quot; thinks they have authority over everybody else. It sickens me. And they force all their horrible and deranged laws upon everybody, when they never agreed to them. I&#39;m so fed up of it. I&#39;m fed up of living in this flawed system. So much futility. I hate you, &quot;government&quot;, you degenerate little scrotes
Comment18	God she&#39;s just as bad as the rest of them
Comment19	Lib Dem‚Äôs need to change its name!
Comment20	I always knew Boris would get the UK out! He will the UK&#39;S best ever PM
Comment21	Lucky us the politicians don&#39;t product anything important for our lives like making food or something similar because with this attitude we would be already death by starvation.
Comment22	BJ MUST have had some sort of &#39;leverage&#39; to get the EU to behave....wonder what is was...as far as the Liberal Traitorcrats  are concerned the best thing about their leader Jo Swinsontis is her t**s...
Comment23	Boris - traitor have nothing , hasn&#39;t any deal, this is surrender act to EU gestapo !
Comment 23.1	"haaaa fake profile and name hiding from appearing as a total fanny low educated idioted IQ , as all studies imply!!! <a href=""https://consent.yahoo.com/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_f6c730cf-0ef5-4e8c-bbbc-3ca95e93d7a9&amp;lang=en-gb&amp;inline=false"">https://consent.yahoo.com/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_f6c730cf-0ef5-4e8c-bbbc-3ca95e93d7a9&amp;lang=en-gb&amp;inline=false</a>"
Comment24	Boris - traitor have nothing , hasn&#39;t any deal, this is surrender act to EU gestapo !
Comment25	Boris - traitor have nothing , hasn&#39;t any deal, this is surrender act to EU gestapo !
Comment26	A great  great new deal, if you are a remainer, not for the rest of us.   All I can say is,  Boris Johnson  and the Tory Party are history.
Comment27	I just want to see corbyns little weasel face and the airhead lib girls too when the deal is rejected as it almost certain will be and we slip out at the last hour with no deal !!! Oh joy !!!!    I ll die a happy woman.  üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
Comment28	The video stopped short before the person who supported the deal was interviewed. I was waiting for that part in order to gain a balanced and two sided perspective. Is this a regular occurance on the BBC?
Comment29	Why is Miss Swinson so certain the deal is an act of economic vandalism when she hasn&#39;t even seen the legal text. Isn&#39;t she jumping the gun? is she simply trying to oppose Johnson for argument&#39;s sake? I&#39;m not saying she&#39;s wrong. it just seems a little premature to me.
Comment30	If you force a 2nd referendum, a clean break Brexit MUST BE  one of the options to vote for, a binary choice between a crap new treaty or remain will lead to civil unrest in the extreme !
Comment31	Attention Boris !  You have not Agreed a Brexit Deal with the British people Mate .  So wind your neck in and Stop trying to Fool us .
Comment32	We already voted , get on with it !
Comment33	this is the only time i would side with labor and libdems over brexit, the deal is terrible, it&#39;s a slight improvement over may&#39;s and i pray that it&#39;s voted out... come on labor and libdems do something useful and save a little face.<br /><br />i&#39;m hoping this terrible deal is just a way around the benn act, get parliament to vote down the deal so we can leave on wto terms, but if this is the case it could be an extremely risky maneuver.
Comment34	"<b>The 130,000 DEAD due to Tory austerity (which Boris Johnson shares responsibility for) SHOULD HAVE JUSTICE..!!</b><br />Murderer of 130,000 by deliberate austerity policy and now a <b>BREXIT TRAITOR, TOO..!!</b><br /><b>Confiscate all personal profits, shares and proceeds from these CON-(artist)- SERVATIVE TRAITORS, who are all STILL planning to PROFIT PERSONALLY by this ACT OF ELITIST TREACHERY..!!</b><br />Pay <b>ALL</b> monies to the dead victims&#39; families <b>UNTIL THE DISGUSTING TORY TRAITORS HAVE NOTHING..!!</b><br />Then we should pursue <b>JUSTICE FOR THE DEAD THEMSELVES..!!</b>"
Comment35	Does she not realise SHE is destroying GB by not getting behind the government! Rushing it though?? Its been 3 years!
Comment36	We didn‚Äôt vote for a deal, we voted to leave, start the mass deportations and ban Islam from the U.K
Comment 36.1	i hope you like it, after Muslim countries deport Britsh citizens because of their country of origin!
Comment 36.2	Bout covers it.
Comment 36.3	Agent Ninja  the most sensible statement I‚Äôve ever seen !!!!!! Well said üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
Comment37	You wish she will would stop
Comment38	Treacherous Swinson.. <br /><br />What a piece of work.<br /><br />1. Voted in favour of the Bedroom Tax.<br /><br />2. Voted for the introduction of UC.<br /><br />3.Voted in favour of scrapping the Educational Maintenance Allowance. <br /><br />4.Voted in favour of increasing Tuition Fees.<br /><br />5.Voted in favour of capping benefits below inflation.<br /><br />Quote: &quot;We shouldn&#39;t have allowed the bedroom tax to go through&quot;.<br /><br />Quote: &quot;We need to learn from those errors&quot;<br /><br />And 6: I would &quot; Revoke Article 50&quot; . <br /><br />No change there then Ms Swinson.<br /><br />This young lady is playing a game of fantasyland politics. She is still wet behind the ears and clearly has a complete disregard for democracy. <br />&quot;Liberal Democrats&quot;. Pure fantasy and a walking contradiction.
Comment39	somebody will put a stop to it ..should of left without a deal .clean break
Comment40	Seen from Belgium, the EU has negotiated more with opposition MPs than with Mr Johnson. The EU seems very confident that the opposition will ask for a referendum on whether or not the people accept the agreement reached.<br />And if the media scared the British as they scared the Europeans who spend too much time in front of their television, it is a foregone conclusion for the EU.
Comment41	five minutes and twenty-two seconds dedicated to a hard no-leave politician that has no idea what&#39;s actually in the deal and isn&#39;t qualified to say if it helps or hurts the economy
Comment42	I knew it was a done deal after the speech of her majesty the Queen.
Comment43	Jo swinson&#39;s family suckles from the EU&#39;s tit financially, she has a very personal interest in the failure of Brexit, and politics are mixed in to gain support for her mission.
Comment44	"one jet drive very emossinal<br /><a href=""http://eunsetee.com/XjDo"">http://eunsetee.com/XjDo</a>"
Comment45	Will Scotland and Wales ask for the same Statut NI will hv ? Half in UK and half in EU :)
Comment46	It&#39;s traditional to make a gesture to the vanquished and I am making it now... those splenetic Remoaners know where the airports are they can take the Tory Left and the Climate Communist puppets with them  to that corrupt undemocratic E.U.swamp with all of you ...Bon Voyage.
Comment47	Brexit was done to kill EU will finally kill UK :)
Comment48	2397 and in news today, we&#39;ve reached a new deal on brexit!
Comment49	Yea agreed, but not accepted yet by the British government.  The liberal Democrats  the dup and labour say they will vote it down. Boris Johnson hasn&#39;t got the majority of the house of commons.  So saturday it&#39;s likely to be a No deal. Back to square one.
Comment50	The police must release environmental activists, compensate the arrested environmental protection personnel, punish the police of violence, allow the environmental protection personnel to mask and allow them to march freely.
Comment51	Bojo  is going to finish like  Mrs.May
Comment52	parliament will decide..... deal or no deal.... NO to brexit
Comment53	Mr. Johnson, pls pay a &quot;patent fee&quot; to China&#39;s one country two systems invented by Mr. Deng Xiaoping.
Comment54	Good kick  m out. No more  extra time.This shit  has gone on for too long. Take a parachute and jump!!!!. This is what  brittain  wanted  good  luck! Can not wait  to see them come  crawling back.
Comment55	As usual (unfortunately) the BBC&#39;s anaysis of Brexit is the shallowest I&#39;ve seen on the internet.<br />What a pity.
Comment56	Jo Swinson is refusing to accept the Referendum result as she has time and time again.
Comment57	the UK decided too leave , go , the reteric that I hear now that the UK want to stay with the EU for trade
Comment58	The final say should be a general election not another referendum. My entire county was over 70% leave, don&#39;t ask US to vote again!
Comment 58.1	70% wasn&#39;t the entire population of Britain dumbass, more like less than a third actually bothered to vote and 70% of those votes were in favour of leave
Comment59	Do not trust boris he is here for the big money not for ordinary people. We will end up poorer with his &#39;deal&#39;. We are screwed.
Comment60	BBC is an excellent news network
Comment61	BIAS Broadcasting... again. Only Surrender politicians, illiberal undemocats. Let‚Äôs hear some pro brexit views
Comment62	Unionists are never happy, But what would Ian paisley say if he was still here.
Comment 62.1	Well how would you feel if your country decisions were just handed over to a foreign power
Comment63	Shocked that Swinson opposed to this eh when her hubby gets paid about four million from the EU a year (but only if there&#39;s no Brexit).
Comment64	THE BBC IS THE UK&#39;S #1 FAKE NEWS ORGANISATION AND WAS BACKING COMMUNIST CORBYN ALL THE WAY AND TO STAY IN THE EVIL EU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />BUT NOW : BRAVO BORIS - BRAVO - REMEMBER YOU ARE SPEAKING FOR US THE 52% TO LEAVE THE MARXIST EU AND FOLLOW DEMOCRACY  AND NOT WHAT COMMUNIST CORBYN HAS IN MIND TO STAY AND TO TURN THE UK INTO A SOCIALIST COUNTRY - AGAIN BRAVO AND WELL DONE - WE HERE CAN&#39;T WAIT UNTIL THE 31.OCTOBER AND THE UK WILL BE FINALLY FREE FROM THE MARXIST EU CLUTCH !!!!!!!!
Comment65	I love the smell of remoaner tears in the morning. It smells like despair üòÜ
Comment66	At the end, the European Union has won the blame game. And this practically<br />with the same deal they signed with Teresa May. Big win
Comment 66.1	Then it too will be voted against in parliament
Comment67	lib dems an labour need to get off their high horses they dont want a deal they dont want a referendum or a general  election what do they want not bieng funny but like 80% of the population want to leave. exactly do they want if the population want to leave i think we should boris johnson made a deal and it&#39;s a lot better than a no deal brexit. GO ON BORIS
Comment68	Jo swinson is completely toxic for our country, boris did the unthinkable and got a deal with the little time he had and still Lib dems and labour are not satisfied. I will never ever vote lib dem or labour EVER after this chaos ends
Comment69	I am sure the Liberal Democrats would have a second referendum worded like this: <br />You have two choices:<br />1) I agree Britain should stay in the EU<br />2) I believe Britain should stay in the EU<br />No other choices are available, people must vote for one or two, end of.<br />Again, why are Remainers like Jo Swinson  always being interviewed and not leavers?  There was certainly no balance <br />In this video, only one side of the debate had a say.  <br />I wish to add I am not against the EU or anyone pro EU,  this is a democratic society. Jo Swindon of course should be <br />Interviewed and a lot of what she says has merit, even if you disagree. But please give equal air time to leavers, so <br />One can be left in no doubt that there is a fair balance of coverage. This video only gives credence to those who believe the <br />BBC should be renamed the ‚ÄúBrussels Broadcasting Corporation‚Äù.
Comment70	DUP is regretted forming a gov with Theresa May once upon a time.
Comment71	Choo choo choo choo the gravy train is getting derailed.
Comment72	A Slimey Scottish Skank you wont see that cumbucket at the next election.

Comment74	If you actually believe any of this dog and pony show is real, get your head read.  Democracy has died.  Prepare for decline and unrest in the coming years.
Comment75	Congratulations to the UK Prim Minster, Boris Johnson! Congratulations to the British people!
Comment76	Politicians will continue to be the enemy. We voted to leave not get a deal. Nobody should forget the betrayal. Vermin we pay for.
Comment77	The end of democracy is in sight ,power not service is in the hands of our parliament a handfull of people that &#39;know best&#39; betray the silent majority.
Comment78	Funny thing is Northern* Ireland isn‚Äôt even part of Britain.... only the ‚ÄúUK‚Äù lol
Comment 78.1	David Cashell Edited
Comment 78.2	Let‚Äôs have a Uxit referendum then. We can pull a Boris and pretend it‚Äôs not a second referendum at all, just a ‚Äúgreat new referendum‚Äù

Comment94	Free Scotland, North Ireland, Wales!!!!! just like FREEHONGKONG and PROTEST IN SPAIN!!!!  What a shame for British always doing disgusting things.
Comment95	Swinson just wheels off doom and gloom with no foundation. Why didn&#39;t the interviewer ask her to point out why this deal would cause that doom and gloom?
Comment96	whats the big deal about working on saturday ?
Comment97	if they like the deal it must be crap ?
Comment98	I read the comments. Dismayed to be living in an undoubtedly right-wing Britain.
Comment99	We still have 10 stick-in-the-muds of the DUP who could also scupper the matter completely. Just as much as the other political parties could do so! But in different ways.
Comment100	BBC speeding shit again
Comment101	Lib dems are bad for Briton full stop
Comment102	The one thing is that it can&#39;t guarantee the outcome of this of a co-operation of the House of Commons in Britain. There was one brief outcome of an agreed passing of a tiny bit of provision. I don&#39;t agree with Jo Swinson and I won&#39;t have any part to do with a further referendum or a general election. In either case of that. I won&#39;t vote in either. She&#39;s procrastinating on this. There&#39;s a much more vital issue to be discussed than Brexit. She and other political party leaders have missed that point.
Comment103	No deal it is then
Comment104	The pleasure of seeing the BBC unable to cope ha ha
Comment105	i was a sordid remainer, but its over. im looking forward to a new dawn.<br />the old one has gone back to her mums....
Comment106	why is she the first one BBC interviews. Typical, get negative straight away. Lib Dems are basic cynical political vultures
Comment107	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWl1xl-7uJw&amp;t=3m32s"">3:32</a> what&#39;s wrong with her teeth?"
Comment108	Lol
Comment109	THIS IS NOT BREXIT   =  ( Mrs may surreneder deal number 4 ) <br />VOTE FOR THE BREXIT PARTY!
Comment110	Will the leave agreement include removing Mays deal she agreed with EU, handing over our armed forces under their control,<br />otherwise that is not leaving.
Comment 110.1	Where were all your worries when Blair was selling -out the uk
Comment111	Finally, The BBC starts caring about the UK, not Chinaü§£ü§£ü§£
Comment 111.1	Oh I&#39;m sure you&#39;re happy about that.
Comment112	I bet..... .the working class  person  gets shafted
Comment113	Jo Swinson is an insane mongrel.
Comment114	If this doesn&#39;t go through our system is clearly screwed and the people we have in power simply cannot be bothered to deliver Brexit. It&#39;s too much work for them in comparison to the cushy little job they are doing allowing europe to dictate our politics they are quite happy doing sweet F all as they have been doing for the last few decades.
Comment115	I am not worried! I am more worried about Jo being undemocratic! She is absolutely in la la land!
Comment116	This Boris deal (treaty) resembles traitor Mays deal, it&#39;s a polished turd. No deal is now the only real option for a true Brexit. Now watch the Brexit parties support skyrocket.
Comment117	So, of all the players in the Brexit debate on this historic day, The BBC gives the bulk of it&#39;s air-time to Swinson - the most anti-Brexit voice imaginable. Now, why am I not surprised!
Comment118	Bet this doesn&#39;t get through parliament.
Comment 118.1	Guaranteed not.
Comment 118.2	@Dovakiin seventeen Saturday 19th October. Tomorrow. Its on a knife edge whether it goes through.
Comment 118.3	How long must we wait to find out?
Comment119	What will happen with Gibraltar? Is it also part of the Uk territory?
Comment120	The way negotiations take place shows why &#39;democracy&#39; gives us no control over what happens with our lives. The only benefit we had was our European citizenship and our right to leave to work in a whole continent. Now we are fencing ourselves in.
Comment121	A Fake Brexit
Comment122	Unbelievable how the politicians in the UK can be so undemocratic. The UK had a referendum and these dectators have decided to ignore the wishes of the people. These undemocratic fools must just remember they will never again be able to preach to any nation in the world about democracy. The politicians in the UK have acted totally undemocratic and they no longer have the right to claim they are a democracy.  A sad day for democracy all over the world to see how one of the oldest and leading democracies in the world has become nothing more than a Mugabe democracy.
Comment123	Get rid of parliament and have a president state parliament like a kids playground
Comment124	Swinson is neither liberal, nor democrat as we already know.
Comment125	Who is this lib dem... honestly talking about damages to the economy.....<br />Get it done .... either way .... sort it
Comment126	Over three years and the same politicians oppose the leave deal. I voted remain but we cannot live in limbo. Just get on with it
Comment127	Jo and the rest of the Liberal dems can fuck off. I don&#39;t give a shit about her EU handouts. If this deal is good it should be passed. And the fact she said the best deal is to be back in the EU. She should be sacked.
Comment128	I bet the BBC hate this deal with the EU.
Comment129	let me guess, parliament decline the deal..... we get another extension and this whole Shiraz continues for another decade?
Comment130	Meaningful üëÄ I wonder if it&#39;s good, the irish don&#39;t like it so I doubt it&#39;s smart. How long must this go on before no deal.
Comment131	And just like this Boris became the new Theresa May :)
Comment132	Is anyone else interviewed in this? 7 minutes in to this BBC &quot;News&quot; and all I&#39;ve seen is libdem views. This takes bias so far overboard it is a farce. Don&#39;t call views news, guys.  Off to find an impartial balanced presentation of fact.
Comment 132.1	hi lamprey
Comment133	You leavers wanted to leave which means no deal. You can&#39;t pick and choose what you want to keep because that&#39;s not taking back control.
Comment134	Oh be quiet ü§ê jo Swinson you are only out for yourself and your money üí¥ grabbing from EU with husband .  You are a traitor to the people of the uk üá¨üáß and only out for your own interests .  You should be eradicated from Parliament- despicable pathetic woman üë© imo ! Btw you don‚Äôt even know the meaning of the words Democrat or democracy -  go back to dummy spitting cradle school üè´üò°
Comment135	Now is the last chance. Either stay with us or swallow what you get. No more whining about special deals.
Comment136	Oh! - how I love all wrong deals our governments but this time the British people will pay the next 500 years. Boris the dealer!
Comment137	People say currently England üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø is the worst country right now. I think they‚Äôre being a bunch of drama queens, it could be waaay worse! üòÇ we could be Sudan üá∏üá© or North Korea üá∞üáµ ...wait...is that Jo Swinson? <br /><br />Yeah, those people were right üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†ÅøüíÄ
Comment138	Jo Swinson is an idiot
Comment139	Get us out Boris tired of remoaners and biased media coverage trying to scare general public.  We all know that people with sane minds want to leave EU asap
Comment140	Boris&#39;s Brexit deal is going to be passed by Parliament. Because . . . .This new plan will keep only Northern Ireland closely aligned with the EU rules, specifically on goods.<br />This avoids any checks on the island of Ireland, though checks will still have to happen on goods moving to or from the island of Ireland from the rest of Britain. But CRUCIALLY,<br />the whole of the United Kingdom ‚Äî including Northern Ireland ‚Äî will get to leave the EU customs union. The arrangements are kind of complicated ‚Äî for example, the UK will have<br />to apply and collect EU tariffs if any goods going from the rest of Britain are at risk of entering Ireland, otherwise known as EU territory. However, leaving the EU customs union<br />means that the whole of the United Kingdom will be free to negotiate new trade deals with countries outside the EU. This is a massive improvement over Mrs May‚Äôs proposed deal.
Comment141	"I could never die, I&#39;m Chuck Norris (Chuck Norris)<br />Fuck the government and fuck Boris (Yeah)  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-Stormzy"
Comment142	What about the british fishing waters?
Comment143	That&#39;s essentially Theresa May&#39;s deal.
Comment144	But it is the same deal as may with a line only changed
Comment145	A good moment to seriously consider the complete losing Northern Ireland from the UK.
Comment 145.1	its possible?
Comment146	Free Ireland
Comment147	England, I wish you much good luck.<br />I hope The Netherlands will also nexit.
Comment 147.1	No
Comment 147.2	how are you?
Comment148	We need open books on every MP to see what interests they do have in Europe.... could be very interesting!
Comment 148.1	Milton77 yes and leave with a clear conscience
Comment 148.2	But then also open books on all the ties to hedge funds, other investment funds and corporations that stand to win from a no-deal brexit. And the impact of any tax regulations of course...
Comment 148.3	Outside the Matrix they are required to do that and exclude themselves from any debate or vote where vested interest can by any conceivable measure be said to conflict.  Given the disgraceful assault on democracy launched by the leftist opposition you would be forgiven for thinking there are no checks on potential abuse of power but there are. The unscrupulous attack on democracy from the so called Lib Dem‚Äôs better labelled leftist dictators and labour motivations  are political and ideological.
Comment149	The only people that don&#39;t want to leave is people with money
Comment150	Jo Swinson is putting on a smug front to hide the fact that she is cacking herself. The vote in the commons will be to support the deal or no deal, with those voting against the deal taken as being in favour of a no deal exit. She is screwed, and her only play left now is to try and revoke article 50. It will be beautiful to watch her and her undemocratic gang go into full meltdown and try to openly cancel democracy to get their way.
Comment151	Jo, people are more worried about the effects to the economy if there is another delay. This deal is a good and fair deal.
Comment 151.1	Why all the excitement  about  the deal, we have been told often enough that the EU is finished after Britain leaves  Britain should worry about fishing wars that we will be fighting  down the road
Comment152	"jo swinson,just f<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ck"">#ck</a> off,you will suffer the wrath of the electorate in the next GE"
Comment153	Typical biased bbc first person they put on is that money grabbing two faced liar joe Swinson their shame knows no bounds they should be disbanded hopefully once Boris gets Brexit and the Lib Dem‚Äôs with them
Comment154	So much air inside her inflated head. It&#39;s not May&#39;s Hard border deal, it&#39;s Bojo invisible border deal. Took that long for her ramblings and still is wrong
Comment155	What do you reckon barnier is going to get all the credit for any deal that eventually happens?
Comment156	I was a remainer but, happy to go with this deal &amp; finish off this SAGA. Let‚Äôs move on. Enough is enough.
Comment 156.1	how about giving the choice of different outcomes? It&#39;s the low educated idiots that feeling the Farage&#39;s and Johnsons have lied to us all might be found out for that is playing the boring game to trick us!!! its simple... Lets put to the people 1/Leave without a deal 2/Leave with a deal 3/ stay!!!
Comment157	NO deal no matter what‚Äôs written on it, will be approved by parliament because no party has an absolute majority. The truth is we need to extend the deadline until 31st December, organise a general election for November, and let each party present their vision for post Brexit Britain and let them decide our relationship with the EU
Comment158	why is Scotland allowed to vote for independence but not n. ireland?
Comment 158.1	Because their government (which hasn&#39;t sat for god knows how long) hasn&#39;t requested one. Southern Ireland also need to agree. Deep down its not feasible as they would need to find the 15billion the UK gives them for healthcare/benefits/pensions etc. Southern Ireland doesn&#39;t have that kind of money. Neither does it have an NHS.....it charges at the point of use, hence only around 25% show as definetley voting to leave the UK. If southern Ireland could provide what the north gets now the vote would be much closer.
Comment159	When jo Swinton was in the Coalition with the torie she Accepted a Bribe Over fracking 13.000 but the con  got found out now she as to pay it back
Comment160	No Deal BREXIT sounding better. <br />It will be nice to see the Union Jack üá¨üáß fly proudly in England üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø.. and never below the EU, 4th Reich, rag again.  <br />Now Londonstan needs to rid the anti English Sadi Kahn... con.
Comment161	Love it or hate it, Boris has done it! FAITH in UK!
Comment162	"Well done everybody...................... And............. Let the smuggling begin !!!          <a href=""https://youtu.be/93RI7Z3HhZk"">https://youtu.be/93RI7Z3HhZk</a>"
Comment163	clickbait?
Comment164	If EU is serious about this deal, the sensible thing to do is say to UK parliament that, you either take this deal or no deal, so everyone can get on with normal life, by then, doesn‚Äôt matter how UK parliament will vote, either this deal or the no deal
Comment165	They won‚Äôt need the DUP or the ERG, he is going to make the Labour, Lib Dem‚Äôs and SNP vote for it as punishment to making extend, when I bet he will say they are not going to extend, its this deal or no deal, and will have no choice but to vote for Boris Johnson‚Äôs deal
Comment166	It&#39;s a shit deal that will fuck this country up. Clap like seals for your ring master. Don&#39;t complain.
Comment167	Your economy is going to be damaged anyway for fuck sake you won&#39;t get a perfect deal just fuck off and leave already
Comment168	Jo Swinson is a joke. She got OWNED by Piers Morgan, couldn&#39;t answer a single question directly. Liberal DEMOCRATS want to ignore the vote completely...... great stuff XD
Comment169	Nevermind the fact that this deal is only about Ireland and not the economic crash this poor country of yours will endure if you Brexit yourself out of the European Union...
Comment170	Hopefully the people of Britain are finally seeing the crux of the problems in  Ireland: the DUP.<br />They have been saying no to everything for decades. Including equal rights for catholics and nationalists. The KKK OF Ireland.
Comment171	If we leave with No Deal or with a deal please everybodyüôè remember! we will become a vassal state of the United States of America our proud country will be gone forever, finally I must say I am so sorry to all you moaners brexit  that  you have had it so tough since 1975 I&#39;m sure we will all kick on xxxxx
Comment172	I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt mean to make light, but I had to chuckle when Mrs. Swinson said she didn‚Äôt like the new deal proposal even though she hadn‚Äôt read the text yet. She reminded me of our own Nancy Pelosi when asked about President Obama‚Äôs ‚ÄúAffordable‚Äù Care Act, she said that they ‚Äúhad to pass it to find out what was in it‚Äù. lol <br /><br />Hope it works out for you lot, cheers!
Comment173	The sooner we&#39;re shot of the UK the better. Nothing but trouble anyway. Go now, for once and for all please. Now the UK can take over estern countries like India and Pakistan without impunity. Oh wait...they&#39;ve already done that!!! The EU is better off without the racist UK. We&#39;ll do just fine without them. What does the UK have to export anyway? Every manufacturing company has ran a mile from this. Nissan, for one example. I&#39;m delighted they are gone. Which colonies will they choose to take over next?
Comment174	Go on Boris!
Comment175	No one will agree..... then we just leave! ride the storm and hope the sun will eventually shine on the otherside. Had enough.
Comment176	Shut up! We already voted to leave and that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre doing October 31st.
Comment177	How about we have a referendum with No Deal, Boris Johnson‚Äôs deal &amp; Remain, on it and if the combined total of no deal and Boris‚Äô deal is more than 50% then we do which ever has the larger share out of those two. As the majority of the country would wants to leave <br /><br />That‚Äôs pretty fair right, then then the country decides what brexit we have rather than these dumb struck crooked MPs!
Comment178	Joe Swindon üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Comment179	Johnson‚Äôs Deal better creates a sustainable, sufficient and resilient future for Britain. Unlike the LibDems whose economic wellbeing fanaticism seeks to protect EU corporate shareholder profits, not our ecological means of survival.
Comment180	It doesn‚Äôt matter what deal the government gets, the opposition parties will not agree to it unless it‚Äôs what they want, democracy in the UK is dead, it‚Äôs now all about these little parties having there own agendas...... the MPs who were appointed by the people should respect their wishes and get on with it. These MPs are paid a shed load of money and benefits for doing nothing it‚Äôs disgusting
Comment181	A biased media corporation asking for a balanced opinion. O, how about Jo Swindon?
Comment182	where will I find the latest Brexit Deal agreement document? Mr Junker stated that the document is available on line. I could not find it on EU website.
Comment 182.1	Well you will probsbly find the DUP, SNP, LIB DEM &amp; Labour copies in the bins in Westminster
Comment183	You call this an &#39;explanation&#39;? BBC is as much to blame for this mess as the politicians who can&#39;t actually tell the public the details.
Comment184	Get Brexit done!!
Comment185	The dramas not over<br />Let act III begin
Comment186	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZgzUNbYk_o"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZgzUNbYk_o</a>"
Comment187	(As a Glaswegian) Swinson is an EMBARRASSMENT to Scotland &amp; The United Kingdom , 17.4 Million people to ignore is not a problem for her and her gang of morons.
Comment188	There is something very disturbing about this lady i just can&#39;t get my head around it.
Comment189	UK is doomed
Comment190	Swinson is neither Liberal or Democratic, but rather a clear and present danger to democracy. A fact that her party will discover when they work up the courage to ‚Äòallow‚Äô a GE. As for Johnson‚Äôs deal, he can stuff it where the sun doesn‚Äôt shine. Brexit Party are the only party with integrity.
Comment191	Junker has ruled out  extension of Article 50 most likely part of the deal.  Labour wont vote for a GE as they will be destroyed and they wont get enough time or backing for a 2nd referendum. So its deal or no deal no more games.
Comment 191.1	Juncker has already back tracked on those comments and there is no chance that a &#39;no further extension&#39; is part of this deal. Face it, the UK are looking at another extension until Jan 31st.  There will be a general election but unlikely that any party will be returned with a majority. So this is going to drag on well into 2020 - the EU will have until 4Q20 before they finalise their budget so don&#39;t be surprised if negotiations go on until then. And don&#39;t forget that this is just the divorce agreement,  The actual Brexit negotiations will not start until a deal has been arranged and agreed - then the actual Brexit talks is expected to last another 2 years where they will look to come to arrangements on future trade, security, etc..
Comment192	Jo Swinson is a Wallace and Gromit villain.
Comment193	I think it&#39;s not fair
Comment194	DUP has been recruited and paid by the eu elite to sabotage this vote. Juncker and his psychopath cronies continue to give new meaning to the word scum.
Comment195	so now johnson has a deal in place the ben act will not apply, so there voting on the deal or hard brexit as there the only options
Comment 195.1	If only Brexit was that simple lol. In 6 months time they will still be trying to negotiate a WA that will get through the HoC. This is the comedy show that just keeps giving.
Comment196	Great, now no hoper CORBYN can do something cant he..yes &quot;I WILL BLOCK IT&quot;. Corbyn the blocker, thats all he does. He has lost millions of Labour Brexit supporters and they will never ever vote Labour again. Hes a swine. He will be responsible for a NO DEAL Brexit now (and his mates the DUP, SNP nad Lib Dems, all of whom are scared of Brexit because it means they are well and truly F**ked)...and Swinson (top Prefect Girl) has no chance when Brexit is finally done and dusted, shes an awful leader.
Comment 196.1	@Gabriel Kelly If you read my above comment I said that as well...doh!!!
Comment 196.2	Well he won&#39;t be alone - DUP, LIB DEMS, Labour and some of the ERG  will all be voting against this deal.
Comment197	Beautiful woman... wozers
Comment198	Almost anything‚Äôs better than the evil, vile and dangerous Labour party
Comment 198.1	Cuts happen but the is nothing wrong with them.
Comment 198.2	mel grant it really depends on which facilities you are referring too and what type of ‚Äòspecial needs‚Äô.
Comment 198.3	@K M D 123 I was referring to the facilities that have been closed that are vital for parents and children.a centre near me that was for special needs children was closed last month.
Comment 198.4	mel grant Michael Gregory The Laziness and spoiling of the underserving population. The society of the UK gets so much non needed benefits to their life&#39;s which makes them Lazy and gives them a feeling that they are entitled to a numerous amount of things other people have rather then outsmarting, creating and beating the competition they blame all this on equality, the government and countless other things. This is a waste of time, their life and only breeds more of this filth. These ‚Äòpeople‚Äô (if you can even call them that) need to suffer for this, these idiotic and lazy layabouts need to be punished. It makes me sick to be honest and the Labour Party would only make this worse while the cuts make it better but it is still not enough.<br /><br />The way in which hardworking, successful business&#39;s and individuals are &#39;painted&#39; as the villains and punished. The Labour Party would only make this worse.<br /><br />Their plans to nationalise things is a waste of cash and they have a evil socialist agenda, which should be banned. The Labour Party and their horrible ideas and ideology should be dismantled and banned.
Comment199	Soooooooo glad the UK is finally gone! Yay!!! We are rid of them now. Finally, let the rest of us get on with our lives instead of holding randsom all the time
Comment 199.1	Not sure what examples of EU being successfully held to ransom you can give me? But nonetheless you can certainly get on with your lives.....and good luck to EU, the UK doesnt wish them any ill will at all. Remember the UK is leaving the EU, not Europe.<br /><br /><br />I live in Slovakia with my wife and children and the lack of any questioning of EU policy, both social and economic by the European media is shocking. Its like they are sleepwalking into a disaster. Actually its not like, they really are sleepwalking, just accepting what politicians say etc<br /><br /><br /><br />One thing you may not have had explained to you by the EU, what the EU budget is going to look like once the ¬£33bllion from UK runs out. How this will effect various EU countries.<br /><br /><br />We wish you good like with the coming debt crisis in the Eurozone....might want to take a look at the numbers there....how much new quantative easing the ECB is undertaking, indeed how much the total QE has been, long term effect of the negative interest rates, levels of unemployment in the under 35&#39;s.......Have you any idea of the total budget is used to pay the growing interest on the EU debt? Whta percentage of budget just pays the interest? Remember this is a common debt pile for the Eurozone, despite Germany passing legislation seeking to limit German taxpayer exposure to Eurozone debts (eg Italy, Greece debt )...but again, you are probably too busy calling the UK &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;a pain&quot; to actually see what is reallly going on...easier just to look at newspaper headlines thatn have any independent thoughts of your own.....:)
Comment 199.2	I&#39;m actually sad that the European Union is losing the UK but at the same time I can understand why they leave
Comment 199.3	It&#39;s not over yet, yes a deal. But it still has to go through the house of commons, and it&#39;s likely not to pass.  So a no deal
Comment200	Wooden planes   propellers spinning in the west Texas wind.
Comment201	This is so twisted, the parliament wants to put Leave voters between a Rock and a Hard place... and offer them ANOTHER referendum on leave with a shite deal (no chance we already know that...) vs remaining in the EU. They are framing it and have been carefully, craftily over the last 3 years, so that the UK doesn&#39;t leave, they were never ever going to be allowed to Leave &gt;_&lt;.. Don&#39;t be fooled by the bullshit spin in the media changing your opinions. Don&#39;t even read this and be persuaded. Put the evidence together and make up your own FREE minds :)
Comment202	Now there‚Äôs another thing to smat0702 the wolf‚Äôs music is sweet to the ears of all who know the words?
Comment203	Of course the BBC doesn&#39;t ask Corbyn, but this &quot;Tory party two&quot; woman that hates Corby and wants to rule with Johnson on her side. The establishment and the BBC will do anything to hurt Corbyn and Labour. They want the nasties that only think with their bank accounts to rule forever.
Comment204	Well...<br />Great... he made a deal with the EU üá™üá∫<br />Let‚Äôs hope he can get it through the House of Commons üòù‚úåÔ∏èüòú
Comment205	Why do the Biased Broadcasting Corporation always dig up Jo Swinson, and yet never ask her about the 3.5m reaons she has for remaining
Comment206	They said Boris were not seriously trying to negotiate a deal. Well he got one, its up to Parliment.
Comment 206.1	@Clem Fandango spot on let&#39;s hope even if it&#39;s by fluke
Comment 206.2	@Mark Shepphard I believe Boris may have gone one better and now the vote will be an act and the House of Commons may have to chose between no deal and this deal. I think Boris may have screwed them over big time. The Benn act isnt worth the paper its written on now.
Comment 206.3	They will not vote it threw and the EU won&#39;t extend to many vitos and they no it the Ben act gets broken by the hands that wrote it read the act well played borris no deal it is
Comment207	I do not recall seeing on the vote in 2016 it was going to the best of 3.If we fail to leave on the 31st I will never vote for anything again.Although I voted to remain in 2016 we lost and really if we truly live in a democratic country we should accept the result and just walk away deal or no deal,i now realise just how corrupt politicians really are tell me again how many voted to¬†trigger article 50 ? Two wars fought just to surrender our once great country to a group of UNELECTED nobodies The Queen is a disgrace as our monarch.and allows THE BANKS TO RUN THE COUNTRY for her and other rich people to get even richer
Comment208	‚ÄúWe agreed on a great new deal that returns us control of the situation - now the parliament must approve it on Saturday, and then we can move on to other policy priorities, such as cost of living, healthcare, crime and the environment.‚Äù
Comment 208.1	@austinbeige who is doing all that shite  you have just spewed?..
Comment 208.2	Or rather privatising health care, removing environmental regulation, reducing the standard of living and making the 0.1% even wealthier.
Comment209	Lib dems and labour are a much  bigger threat to democracy than the EU it seems.
Comment 209.1	it&#39;s quite hilarious. at this point the EU understands we don&#39;t want them and they&#39;re trying to get a deal through and yet the libs are still clinging onto a bureacratic European Union that has already adjusted to the reality of the UK leaving.
Comment210	I like Swinson!!! <br />How many poisoned comments I just see here!!! <br />Lol<br />Low class naivity is limitless.. Lol<br />Extension.. Second referendum... Remain. And move on important things finally... Tax super rich and Re invest tax in population.. Job done<br />That&#39;s how it ends.. Iam super sure. <br />Period
Comment211	Suck it up Brits.
Comment212	I didn&#39;t know Brits could be this stupid. It&#39;s the same deal with different wording. You&#39;re still in the customs union for at least a year. A jiont commission will decide when you leave. Only thing is now the EU has all the power. You have no voting rights. No country in the world is going to agree to a deal until thats over. The racist don&#39;t even get what they want. Man this is what it&#39;s like when you think you&#39;re still world leaders, but aren&#39;t. Just usable pawns on the world&#39;s greater stage, b/c countries need strategic land placement.
Comment213	Another sanctimonious, fear-mongering liberal pushing their own agenda instead of doing what&#39;s right for the country.
Comment214	If it came out of Mr Johnsons mouth, its a lie.
Comment 214.1	@Mark Shepphard him and his filthy little mates will benefit, as they have all been betting against the UK economy toppling. It will be the likes if you and me paying for it.
Comment 214.2	Yes it is and he knows they won&#39;t vote it threw and there is not time for extention in fact if they vote it down the Ben act becomes void so no deal here we come we&#39;ll played borris lololol
Comment215	fire all the mp&#39;s as they are a bunch of childish idiots that cant agree to anything. the people had a vote it was in favour of brexit even tho i wanted to stay in the EU. no just get on with doing what the peoples vote wanted instead on this childish moaning or be fired and save the people some time and money.
Comment216	Swinson ! Whatever.
Comment217	This Deal is just a ploy, by Johnson to get a no-deal, as he must know that it is not going to pass through the House of Commons, The DUP, do not want a deal, no matter what they state, Johnson has already stated time and time again he does not want an extension. The DUP will play the Orange card as always in order to back Boris, their paymasters.
Comment218	Surely as EU Law is superior to UK Law, if the EU decide not to allow an extension and the MPs vote against the new Treaty agreed today, we will leave without a deal on the 31st October. The Remainers and Opposition will have made that happen without Boris having to do anything. If they vote for it we will leave with the deal (Treaty as JCJ calls it) on the 31st and the whole saga will be over!!<br />The majority of the UK voted to leave because of this power the EU now had over the UK sanctioned over many years by our politicians. Hopefully only for a few days now.....
Comment219	Exactly - review the detail, including fine print, with a fine tooth comb.  If it‚Äôs still a poor deal, then WALK AWAY for crying out loud. The EU knows exactly what Britains want, they‚Äôre NOT stupid, they‚Äôre MANIPULATIVE.  Enough time has passed to approve a deal the British want.  <br />No deal is a deal.
Comment220	One way or another there will be a hangover on sunday.

Comment222	Oh look... we&#39;ve got a BRAND NEW, FRESH deal, that was rigorously negotiated with determination, and it was Boris&#39;s skill, and pressure that changed everything since Mrs. Mays Surrender document..... What a load of bollocks... honestly, do they think the UK public are stupid or what!
Comment223	The only people Jo Jo represents are herself and her husband, desperately trying hard to hang on to their money and image.

Comment 223.2	@The Forest Mystic Singh send me the link please!
Comment 223.3	@Tertius Faber I don&#39;t need to prove anything to you. It was based on video content on this channel actually. Perhaps you should do your own research rather than expect others to prove their statements to you.
Comment 223.4	@The Forest Mystic Singh you still didnt prove your first statement... If your research ist based on reading the sun and following Nigel Farage (who by the way really takes handouts in ‚Ç¨ by the EU) on twitter we have nothing to discuss anyway..
Comment 223.5	@Tertius Faber You sound rather immature. Why don&#39;t you just do your own research instead of expecting others to prove things to you.
Comment224	North Ireland should be able to leave the UK.
Comment 224.1	It has the power to do so whenever it may decide to.
Comment225	Oh so we‚Äôre actually allowed to hear, some of the details of this deal? What a privilege.
Comment 225.1	It&#39;s online and has been for hours.
Comment226	If people are truly worried about their children‚Äôs futures, then abolish the central bank cabal, these parasites have created enough boom-bust wealth transfers that have sucked the economic force out of ALL countries. Abolish the IMF, BIS, ECB, BOE, Fed Res, etc.  They are parasitic middle person entities and are NOT NEEDED to carry out financial transactions, either domestically or internationally. Stop the ‚Äúlegalized counterfeiting‚Äù.  The SDR - brain child of the IMF &amp; BIS - is not the solution, it‚Äôs more of the same fiat garbage except worse, it‚Äôs ALL DIGITAL, not even phony paper that you can ‚Äúpretend‚Äù to own.

Comment228	„Äã NATO MUST KICK TURKEY OUT OF THE NATO COALITION!!! „Ää
Comment 228.1	finish your Brexit first...than we have time to focus on importent issues in Europe...  with the UK out of the way, <br />the UK will never ask for removing Turkey, because Trump has buissnes inTrukey, and because the UK is on the leach of the US/Trump, the UK will keep its mouth shut and waiting for orders from Washington...
Comment229	I like how Johnson is positioning himself to blame parliament. The reality is that Brexit is undeliverable and does not fit with the leave campaigns rhetoric.
Comment230	Ass but, dream America.
Comment231	Jo Swinson the most anti democratic person you will ever meet, I hope she loses the next election, so we can get rid of such rubbish for our damaged parliament, due to people like her!
Comment232	Westminister turn aroundüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Comment233	This country need a purge, we need to get rid of politicians who can&#39;t understand democracy. In Scotland no one ever voted for Margaret Thatcher goverment but we had to accept the decision because of democracy. Also need to get rid of Scotish national party they &#39;re Toxic.
Comment234	How wonderful to hear that Jo Swinson cares about people¬¥s opinion denying result of the brexit referendum at the same time. Sad clown she is.
Comment 234.1	NOname Common Sense agreed
Comment 234.2	She a novice at best
Comment235	Nonsense - parlliament will vote against.
Comment 235.1	Don&#39;t agree with you
Comment236	She is speaking nonsense. The oposistion didn&#39;t complain about the economic details of May&#39;s deal, they complained about the Back Stop. Now Boris has solved that, they are complaining about something else. They are just saying no for the sake of saying no. Don&#39;t they realise that the people want this to stop, above and beyond all else. Our families, our businesses, our hope for the future are tired of trying to double guess what our politicians are going to come up with next. Let&#39;s have four years of peace.
Comment 236.1	@Jamal Peoples Why do you feel the need to call me a moron? I doubt very much that you have read the details of this deal. However, in simple terms, the Back stop is no longer a case for holding up the Brexit.
Comment 236.2	The backstop didn&#39;t change you moron. They just changed the wording. You still are stuck in the customs union. They just said until 2020. The problem isn&#39;t solved now and it won&#39;t be solved in 10 months time. This is the same deal with different wording.
Comment237	No, Jean-Claude and EU parasites -  a deal is NOT always better than no deal. Sometimes NO DEAL IS the best deal, that‚Äôs the point. If the deal is not conducive to a country‚Äôs sustainability as it‚Äôs sucking the life force of the economy -hint: IMF &amp; BIS austerity measures under the guise of ‚Äúhelping humanity‚Äù - then said country must be prepared to WALK AWAY, trust in its citizens.  The citizens are the ones who built the country in the first place, and there‚Äôs more of us than the money-hungry plutocratic parasites.
Comment238	Up to date journalism but incredibly inaccurate, sloppy phrased that actually are not true , roll if drums, &quot;A deal has been agreed between the EU and the UK&quot;, not true!

Comment242	Good luck Mr PM trying to get your new deal through the commons.
Comment 242.1	@Jamal Peoples Exactly why I wished him good luck; in tongue and cheek. He won&#39;t get it through commons.
Comment 242.2	It&#39;s the same deal with different wording.
Comment243	Jo Swindle DESPERATE  to Save the ¬£3.5m she benefits from In EU PAYOUTS
Comment244	I love how all the  opposition were so afraid of leaving on the 31 with no deal but now that there is a deal they are like no its worse then a No deal. If that reject this I think it will. R vary hard for them to get an extension and the prime minister  can blame all the other parties in the upcoming election and be in the right. He did his job now it‚Äôs time for Parliament to do theirs
Comment 244.1	Absolutely correct. I can see why the hard liners like Farage would be against this deal. But for the others who are desperate to avoid a hard brexit what could be better than a deal which is criticised as so soft not leaving at all....?   Perhaps another referendum! These people are very transparent. They claim to be against a hard brexit but in reality they are jut against brexit.
Comment245	S hat gives her the right to change the vote?<br />She‚Äôs so arrogant and patronising  with  her<br />self satisfied smug smirk
Comment246	The Swinsons get millions from the EU. Conflict of interest? Yep. Corruption. Yes indeed. Anyone give a damn? Hell YEAH!
Comment247	She knows she&#39;s fucked up because the Ben&#39;s act will be broken by these mugs if not excepted so no deal brexit is on lolol
Comment248	Jo swinsonshut the fuck up

Comment251	&quot;Huge uncertainty at Westminster....&quot;?¬† REALLY?¬† After interviewing a Lib Dem-agogue who have been against Brexit from day one?¬† How utterly ridiculous!¬† Reporters like this ignoramus are why the modern BBC is considered nothing more than a leftist propaganda organization.
Comment252	She looks pissed off because, Boris, got a deal. She is even more pissed off because the EU is happy with it.
Comment 252.1	@Mark Shepphard the truth is what it is. You&#39;re stuck in the Customs Union. The EU get to dictate when you leave.. It&#39;s that simple. You really don&#39;t any leverage. This is the same deal as a year ago with different wording. Then everyone is going to fuck you on trade agreements. What does the UK produce that the world wants? SE Asia produces everything. America buys everything and owns most intellectual properties. They also produce weapons which the world buys. The UK produces nothing and has no buying power. South Africa now has more buying power. Again, thanks for stepping off the world stage.
Comment 252.2	@Jamal Peoples lolol elvis just walked in fella Nice try tho Jamaica
Comment 252.3	@Mark Shepphard the EU never meant to give a deal. The Brits have no trade power. There biggest trade partners are the EU, USA, and China. China isn&#39;t going to give you a good deal. You&#39;re no longer big enough without the EU. The EU isn&#39;t going to give you one b/c you left. Trump promised a good, but silly Brits didn&#39;t know Trump can only impose tariffs on deals already done, not make them. Pelosi has said she won&#39;t give one while a republican is in office. You guys are fucked on that front. You&#39;re no longer a world leader in any way. You don&#39;t have a great military. You aren&#39;t this great producing giant. You guys really are not anything. Thanks for stepping off the world stage.
Comment 252.4	And now they won&#39;t pass the bill and no extention because this wasn&#39;t in the Ben act silly people no deal here we come the EU thinks parliament will vote it threw but they over played there hand these liberals are no liberals they messed up
Comment 252.5	It was the same deal as always. They just changed the wording. The EU still decides when you leave the customs union. Damn you Brits are stupid. The EU now holds more power all so that Boris could push thru the same deal and become PM. Did you even look at the details of the deal?
Comment253	Jo Swinson is pathetic
Comment254	There was a people&#39;s vote and it was to leave. Swinson and Corbyn will vote down anything that comes along in the hopes Brexit will not happen. The DUP on the other hand if they had their way would move NI back to the 1950s when they could gerrymander all the elections. The DUP campaigned against the Good Friday Agreement in the first place. Complete mess all around.
Comment 254.1	Did you even look at the details of this new deal. You are still stuck in the customs union. Only now with no vote. The EU will still decide when you leave.  Man you Brits are stupid.
Comment255	Deal,? Ha whatever . Isn&#39;t going to happen
Comment256	I feel that even if this deal said there would be no border and the UK would get ¬£2 billion a week, some silly sod would still say that it would be bad for the economy. Over the past few months, the idea of a No Deal Brexit has grown on me. I&#39;m rather hoping that our own silly parliamentarians  do block this deal. Then it won&#39;t be the fault of Boris or the EU,  but on the heads of the minority who think, or pretend, they know what the people of the UK want. What we want is, &#39;out&#39;. Now let&#39;s get on with it. PLEASE.
Comment257	DUP just are maintaon8ng their mandate from their people of retaining a say in how yh it province is ran.  Fair play, even if they are a bunch of bigotted scum. They never agree by this weekend though or the 31st. There will be a no deal Brexit initially until the DUP get what the assurance of their custom border vote and save face in front of the blue white and red brigade in the Belfast slums.
Comment258	Get lost Jo with economic bombshell nonsense. The EU were worried we&#39;d outcompete them with lower regulations etc and our economy would benefit as a result (the old we won&#39;t let you become a Singapore on the sea line). <br /><br />GUTTED! hahaha
Comment 258.1	James Conroy No need to start name calling James, that just makes you look immature and less than confident in your arguments.<br /><br />Where do you get that fantastical idea from you‚Äôll have a best in class trade deal with the EU?? The fact that you have a trade deficit has to do with others being more apt a producing certain goods and services. I don‚Äôt see the UK suddenly producing world class cars. In fact, a lot of manufacturers have closed or have plans to close due to Brexit. Unless the English suddenly start to go to work by bicycle en mass, imports of cars (to give but one example) will just increase.<br /><br />non-EU countries that want any preferential treatment outside of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules have to meet the bloc‚Äôs standards, whether it‚Äôs on immigration, movement of goods or meeting European standards. That‚Äôs something the EU has always been adamant about.<br /><br />Also, with the UK economy set to shrink as per all of the government‚Äôs own predictions that just makes the UK‚Äôs position that much weaker in forming a trade deal<br /><br />The financial industry, the cork on which the UK economy floats, is being affected by brexit as we speak. We can only speculate what happens if the UK would lose its ‚Äòpassporting rights‚Äô and how it will cope with no longer being able to rely on the likes of ESMA
Comment 258.2	@Milton77 I was talking about Jo Swinson being gutted. She clearly is.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t simple logic from you, it&#39;s simpleton logic. Did you forget that we&#39;re the biggest export market for the EU and that there is a huge trade deficit???<br /><br />Less regulation and bureaucracy mean more outside investment. Future trade deals outside the protectionist EU and the &#39;best in class free trade agreement&#39;  with the EU mean cheaper imports all round.   <b>You Numpty</b>
Comment 258.3	James Conroy James Conroy I‚Äôm up for that. Will you do the same? Brexiteers don‚Äôt have a good reputation when it comes to looking back at their old statements...<br /><br />Also, not taking my cues from Channel4, just simple logic: if you reduce your tariffs and regulations (your ‚Äòoutcompeting‚Äô) you get more imports. UK won‚Äôt be part of the single market anymore either = (higher) tariffs = less export to the EU (UK‚Äôs current largest market).<br /><br />And do remember that this is an AGREEMENT that the EU is SIGNING UP to (sorry: no italics in youtube) so they‚Äôre not gutted and they‚Äôre not the ones that have been holding up Brexit - that was UK parliament voting down all deals, all deal options and no deal
Comment 258.4	Milton77 you‚Äôd believe anything channel 4 and the guardian tell you.<br /><br />Give it six months or so. Then come back and read your misguided comment again
Comment259	‚ÄúLaid back?‚Äù What a dolt. BoJo put something together in 3 months,  you guys wouldn‚Äôt do anything for 3 years.
Comment 259.1	John McCord <br />1. BoJo didn‚Äôt put anything together: the man is not about content<br /><br />2. I wouldn‚Äôt call it ‚Äòput together‚Äô if you just take your previous boss‚Äôs plan, take put the backstop and put in something that look suspiciously like what the EU originally suggested before the UK insisted on the backstop
Comment260	They say this deal is worse than Theras May&#39;s deal. I get the impression these people don&#39;t know what they want. Just going around in circles, frustrating us the voters. Not doing what we voted for in the referendum. What a circus, full of clowns.
Comment261	Boris went into the carpet shop and negotiated a higher price.
Comment262	Ahahahahaha little under a 100 years ago they put guns to the Irish leaders heads saying sign your name for home rule or you&#39;ll have no home left to go home to.  This time the Brit&#39;s have put the gun to their own heads and are calling themselves chicken if they dont play Russian roulette with their finger already on the trigger. At least the Brit&#39;s get to vote,  the Irish just had to sign. First real benefit to the Irish since we got are independence. No Brexit south of the border.
Comment263	why do you give swinson air time she gets too much airtime pro rata her votes fw
Comment264	It a Boris deal which means it won&#39;t be good for the UK or its people but will be very good for the Tories, they get to enact yet more inhuman and draconian rules and they can call it legally right..
Comment265	Jo Swinson wants the people to have their say, erm Jo, they did  have their say 3 years ago in the referendum. Oh what was it? LEAVE the EU.  what a joke that woman is!!
Comment266	So he‚Äôs read the 60 paged deal and only reports on the stuff I‚Äôm not interested in..... what about ECHR !!! What about fisheries !!! What about immigration!!! What about our bendy bananas üçå!!!
Comment267	This title is a lie. The deal has not been agreed by parliament or the people.
Comment 267.1	And it won&#39;t be borris knows this and if they decline the pm offer its no deal lololol he&#39;s cleverer than he looks the Ben act will be broken by the hand that wrote it no deal he we come
Comment268	How can she speak without knowing the legal text!!? SCAREMONGERING
Comment269	It&#39;s time to dump the party of NO the backward bigoted DUP.
Comment270	if Jo doesnt like it i love it ! how can she come out with such bs when shes hasnt even read it and trust the bbc to be predictable and be bias cant wait for it to be dismantled
Comment271	I very much doubt if Corbyn and his cronies will push this through as all he cares about is getting another pointless extension and then having a General election to see if he can get into power which if he succeeds will   bring the country  into chaos  like we had in the 1970s and ruin all the great work this Conservative party have achieved through the face of adversity. .
Comment272	&quot;we&#39;ve got a great new identical deal for the fourth time&quot;
Comment 272.1	It&#39;s not identical, Mays deal had us tied to the hip, stil paying into EU coffers but with no vote. Resolution of the hard border in Ireland changes the relaationship sunstantially, including should the deal pass, the UK will be able to make it&#39;s own trade agreements, end of freedom of movement, will still likely have to fork over the 39bn and the DUP are gonna be spitting teeth for 20 years but the customs issue essentially gives Brexit voters what they want, well, mostly. Will likely take several years to agree a free trade agreement with EU, noones gonna like that deal most likely as the EU are ruthlessly efficient with their trade agreements but won&#39;t be BoJo&#39;s problem then.
Comment273	If  her and her man lose money that&#39;s a gd thing
Comment274	I bet you! The BBC are hating this arnt you? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üëèüëèüëèüëè

Comment 275.1	Can‚Äôt stand the sound of her or look of her smug corrupt mug - she makes me feel sick ü§Æ
Comment 275.2	i would satisfy her.
Comment276	yay! no matter what happens, Divided Queendom is going down. There is enormous ironic pleasure in watching your slavers go bankrupt through democracy. I wish they get what they did. YAY!
Comment277	This woman is a danger to our country , her only objective is to remain in the undemocratic EU . Unfortunately the LD have to deal with it . If they put it back to the people then why do we need parliament and indeed her ?
Comment278	EU-UK  1-0
Comment279	I wish she would stop saying Liberal Democrats. At this point it sounds like nails scraping against a black board to me...
Comment 279.1	Alf Grant Boris‚Äô ‚Äúdeal‚Äù is a trap locking us into the EU, stopping us controlling our own coastal waters, foreign policy and tax rates! Reject this deal! No deal and WTO the only option!
Comment 279.2	@Revoltingsheeple Ben Shapiro is a Zionist civnat, the literal opposite of me.
Comment 279.3	@Ian Holloway lol indeed. Imagine trying to pretend you&#39;re not just a run of the mill right wing capitalist by accusing a literal socialist of being one and calling yourself &quot;fascist&quot;. It&#39;s Ben Shapiro levels of intelligence on display lmao
Comment 279.4	@Revoltingsheeple lol.
Comment280	After hearing what the deal is I sincerely hope Parliment don&#39;t vote for it.<br />It&#39;s a weak treacherous surrender of a deal from Boris just to meet the October deadline in which we would be tied into for years to come and STILL under the EU dictatorship.<br />Boris is selling us out.
Comment281	Where‚Äôs the detail!!!!!!<br />I don‚Äôt trust this !!!!!!!
Comment282	The public having their say doesn‚Äôt mean a damn thing to you, Jo Swinson! You only like democracy when YOU agree with it. That‚Äôs not democracy! Makes me sick ü§¢
Comment283	I&#39;m a Brit that lived and worked in the EU for years and benefitted but most Brits have no idea what is going to happen as soon as we leave the EU.<br />The party leaders you think run this country don&#39;t so It doesn&#39;t matter what deal they come up with, it&#39;s just a front! The rich will do just fine, no matter what, the ordinary people will begin to understand the consequences when all is said and done.
Comment284	Congratulations to UK, it&#39;s the best choice.<br />Here in Belgium we are going to collapse within 10 years, with the monster.....<br />Great choice. ... I wish you the best

Comment 284.3	Wales is lovely place you will allways be welcome brother allways
Comment285	If ONE penny is handed over, you are the same as the scum before you and can join the lemming cliff and swing
Comment286	Lets have a general election and watch Libdumbs crumble... <br /> Watch Bojo get his majority, watch Brexit get done and Corbyn get his p45. Politics back to normal. <br /> No true liberals can support a dictatorship which does not respect democracy and walks hand in hand with Tories.  Rediculous protest movement.
Comment287	This is May 4. ECJ still in charge of many areas, there is equivalence and plus for the EU and is not taking back control at all. No nation state would accept this.
Comment288	I thought the Queen had already told this tart what was happening! can&#39;t wait for the next election...
Comment289	Why would the BBC interview Jo Swinson.<br />She is so anti Brexit and will say anything. Could we get someone who could explain than talk shit
Comment290	Boris Johnson also said that today is Thursday.
Comment291	Can we fuck the criminal Romanians off NOT to be confused with the decent ones who help contribute and not scrounge and cause a naughbou rhood nuisance

Comment 293.1	@Micheal stephen Charles Nigel Farage hates it yet rees mog-whatshisname with the glasses loves it - so im not sure
Comment 293.2	We need a no-deal brexit. Otherwise we are not in control.
Comment294	She hasn‚Äôt actually answered any of his questions. I hate people who are like that. Says something but brings no evidence!
Comment 294.1	ur black, u should be used to that by now.
Comment295	That liberal leader is simply nuts.
Comment296	Everyone please get out you magnifying Glass and read all the fine print. If the EU NWO is ok with it you better do the work, study the documents, and the facts will bring the truth to light. Better a clean no deal brexit vs a may surrender deal with lipstick.
Comment297	No deal brexit is the only brexit. Don&#39;t listen to the EU and Boris, they&#39;re working together now to take away our rights and freedom.

Comment299	Congratulations Mr Prime Minister.
Comment300	The EU negotiated a deal with Theresa,  now with Boris.... If it doesnt go through,  whats the point of entering negotiations with the UK PM if it is a waste of time?
Comment301	So now us brits are 2nd class citizens in europe. We have lost our freedom of movement travel, work, holiday, marry in europe. We are worse off!!<br />And all this so Boris and co can dodge TAX!!
Comment 301.1	@Aaron Giles you never can tell but at least it won&#39;t be us
Comment 301.2	@Mark Shepphard Well I don&#39;t think anyones learned how to build a wall in an ocean to seperate two countries, am sure Mexico would pay for it though.
Comment 301.3	@Aaron Giles lol what a wall we won&#39;t build it the EU will
Comment 301.4	It&#39;s a deal that leaves EU on WTO terms, end of freedom of movement unless Parliment votes it down, then we leave on 31st Oct with no agreement at all and a hard border in Ireland.
Comment 301.5	It won&#39;t get voted threw so we will leave on no deal even better
Comment302	Lib Dems are utterly undemocratic!
Comment303	BREXIT THE BEST REALITY SHOW EVER üòä
Comment 303.1	It&#39;s quite amusing to watch from the sideline when you&#39;re not in the UK.<br />Same with watching America and its president. It&#39;s better than watching the Osbournes. Never have so many basic tasks taken so much effort, arguing, and fingerpointing.<br />Just sucks for those who are dealing with the consequences of those reality TV stars.
Comment304	In the times that we are, democracy has died and there is no more.  The rest is pure ideology and master plays, to face each other.  We are slaves of the system.  While they get richer from our taxes and we get more impoverished.
Comment305	So EU gets 35 billion?  Thank you BorisüòÇ
Comment306	Seriously? Such a leftist mentality; offer a conclusive opinion, but dont look at the facts. Whats the point in even asking the Lib Dems on Brexit anyway, they&#39;ve publically said they oppose it? Another Socialist/Elititst Authoritarian.
Comment307	üòÇ    it ain&#39;t happening
Comment308	A foreign journalist? Presumably with loyalty to another country in the EU? Chance of bias?
Comment309	We all know the Commons ain&#39;t going to vote for it,so why the FUCK are we wasting our time even discussing it.
Comment310	I‚Äôve never said this about anyone before but Jo Swinson is such a negative and depressing person. Doesn‚Äôt she realise that most of the public just wants to move on now and hear some positive news as everyone is sick to death if all the haggling.
Comment311	Not as worried as you swinson  .Your gravy train üöû is ready for disembark
Comment 311.1	@Keith Shephard pretty small beer
Comment 311.2	Hamish Somerville The gravy train will certainty hit the buffers for the EU trough feeders.<br />About time too!
Comment 311.3	That because Boris is already riding it.
Comment312	Any deal that the EU calls &quot; a fair deal&quot; is a &#39; bad deal for the UK&#39;.  A NO DEAL is the only viable deal. Smash it all then rebuild.
Comment 312.1	@Oli Cansdale We lost, the vote was non binding but two thirds of parliment voted it into law. I&#39;m sure if you googled you&#39;d have plenty of MP&#39;s names to write to and ask wth were they thinking. Many of those are going to be trying to sink Brexit for leavers and hope to find a way not to get blamed for the hard border in Ireland they would be creating. I would rather have stayed in the EU but I&#39;m really left wondering who wanted to keep their cake and still eat it.
Comment 312.2	No Brexit is the only viable deal.
Comment 312.3	@Zane Fowler The DUP certainly won&#39;t. Am really pleased Boris didn&#39;t throw Ireland under the bus, have to wait and see if Parliment still does though.
Comment 312.4	Mmhmm I&#39;m sure northern ireland agrees with you... not!
Comment313	Boris Johnson and Jean Claude Junker agree on a deal.<br />The first person BBC interviews is a Liberal-Democrat.
Comment 313.1	@Giuroiu Adrian<br />That might also happen. :-)
Comment 313.2	I thought that the more i study politics , the more I want to be a sniper.
Comment 313.3	@Giuroiu Adrian<br />Nope. I am the masochist.<br />Imagine a mountain higher than Everest made of a certain thing of the same colour as cocoa. That&#39;s politics EVERYWHERE. <br />The more you study politics the more reasons you find to be a monarchist. It&#39;s just hard to agree to let theese liars have certain powers.
Comment 313.4	Yep. Fair and balanced to the right.
Comment 313.5	You&#39;re a Romanian that enjoys politics, that&#39;s a first. We have our own stupid, lying,  politicians, the British aren&#39;t that special. I don&#39;t enjoy politics maybe I am a masochist.
Comment314	No just get on with it.
Comment315	I see Scotland wants to stay yoked to Brussels?....well piss off then...we English want OUT!
Comment 315.1	English here, no thanks.
Comment 315.2	What we need is an English referendum on Scotland.
Comment316	Will the UK finally get it&#39;s independence?
Comment317	Jo Swinson  rolls eyes...
Comment318	Free Britain! üá¨üáß
Comment319	Sound familiar?<br />British version of &quot;One country, two system&quot;,
Comment 319.1	üòÅüòÅüòÅ
Comment320	Why interview her?
Comment321	Yes, the public should have the chance to have a final say on the new deal!!!
Comment 321.1	It&#39;s to complicated for us didn&#39;t you no pal
Comment322	Ah - the left BBC...... üòé
Comment323	Well if MP‚Äôs reject this Brexit deal then it will show its not the prime minister increasing the Brexit crisis but mps in parliament who keep dividing the country
Comment324	There is no more room for a new ref.
Comment325	BoJo has done this move so he can blame the parliament for not accepting his deal. When in fact it&#39;s his fault Tory members abandoned him. If he didn&#39;t manage to convince his own Tories how can he expect to convince the opposition? Totally unrealistic.
Comment326	Question, what about making sure the British people get a vote on joining an EU ARMY? if the so called lady believes in it she can join the military.
Comment327	Didn&#39;t vote for a deal.  Voted to leave.  I&#39;d rather no deal and free country outside undemocratic EU.
Comment328	BBC turns to be BIASED,  BIASED and CUSTOMIZED Against the COMMON PEOPLE OF BRITAIN
Comment329	Ireland united at last.
Comment 329.1	Philip Cooper it will happen, the good Friday agreement states that when NI wish to rejoin the republic they can. <br /><br />Even without the Irish border, They would still be trying to block Brexit ... they use Ireland as an excuse to frustrate the process
Comment330	Jo Swindson said the public must have the final say, but she said a few weeks ago that it would not matter if a majority voted for Brexit again.  She would still oppose it.  The compliant BBC, of course, would not challenge her on that.
Comment331	This woman, Jo Swinson is not worth listening to. üòéüåª She has an inflated opinion of her position.
Comment 331.1	Lol,  as does the UK.. (Having an inflated opinion of their position..)
Comment 331.2	Looks like he shafted the DUP..
Comment332	Boris is a joke
Comment333	Of course you get Jo Swinson out for this, literally the first MP they ask is an avid Remainer.  Terrible reporting, where is the national enthusiasm for the deal, or for Brexit altogether?  Find an MP that supports our Government&#39;s efforts to respect a democratic vote!   BBC shocking.
Comment334	Nice one
Comment335	Its either this deal or no deal, suck it up.
Comment 335.1	@Onaconda only option left for the PM is to request an extension after he loses the commons vote on his latest brexit deal.
Comment 335.2	@Chib Rajput Then Boris will ask the EU not to accept his request.
Comment 335.3	I think you&#39;ll find the PM requesting an extension from the EU. The government doesn&#39;t have the numbers to make sure this new deal passes through parliament on Saturday.
Comment336	Okay, so the PM and EU came to an agreement.  Now, if parliament vbotes it down, it&#39;s on them.  Boris has amazingly done his part to make Brexit a success.  Now it&#39;s parliament&#39;s turn.
Comment337	The economy deal first
Comment338	Only a HARD Brexit will Do!
Comment 338.1	House of lords seen to it that will never happen. They need 39 billion of our tax payers other ties ie our forces
Comment339	I want the UK expelled from the EU. They&#39;re a pain in the ass and they are welcome to Northern Ireland the DUP.  No one will want to do business with them.
Comment 339.1	@Mark Shepphard Of joy. Stupid fucks.
Comment 339.2	Lololol I can taste your tears
Comment340	Fascinating that some people still talk about Remain, after the people have voted to leave, and so much work, money and time has been spent to get Brexit done in the UK and in Europe. Families have been moved abroad, companies have adjusted their operations ahead of Brexit,... it&#39;s way too late in the process to go back to something people have not voted for... so I really don&#39;t understand why this is even mentioned.
Comment341	The May deal now the BOJO deal
Comment 341.1	"<b>*HAIL BRUTUS*</b> Boris JOHNSON<br /><br />so  you have finally done it, as solidly predicted, for weeks now, <br />FORCING NEW enslaving TREATY<br />for and on UK, selling down DUP, Wales and SCOTLAND,  as just pawns on your CHESSBOARD,  <br />game,  what will be lost in the <br />UK PARLIAMENT and FIRMLY REJECTED. <br /><br />So you can then play wounded BAMBI role, as the &quot;SAVER&quot; MESSIAH, who tried, but sadly olive branch you sat on, was cut underneath you.<br /><br />Why we suffered headaches 3 and half years of nightmares, BIG TOP CIRCUS performance <br />when you masterminded and agreed to 95%<br />May&#39;s old TREATY deal. <br /><br />WELL BORIS, now acting, like NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN incarnated, looking at you, as you speak from both corners of the mouth and spitting falseness as you speak, with sugary tongue, KARMA WILL TEACH YOU BIG LESSONS, boyo...<br />Were 5 minutes of ***FAME to you***, back-slapping, huge embraces JUDAS kissing worthy to you to BETRAY MILLIONS of UK &amp; Northern Ireland population?<br /><br /> Like a catfish, you swallowed  EU bait, hook, line and sinker.

Comment342	Thing is if the vote is taken and passed then the Benn act will be invalid which means no extension thus no deal .
Comment343	The only thing that will make this woman happy is to stay in the EU. A &#39;public vote&#39;  is effectively  &#39; a second referendum&#39;  if you don&#39; t like what people vote keep voting until you get the result you want. (Like Nicola Sturgeon)
Comment344	To deliver in Brussels, the UK must compromise -¬†<br />but to deliver in Parliament, the UK cannot compromise in Brussels.
Comment345	Labor Party leader Communist Jeremy Corbyn, says he will vote against this new agreement ü§®<br />Corbyn is an enemy of the UK üò°

Comment 346.4	Leave the EU and come form an triple alliance with Australia and New Zealand.
Comment347	Do we get rid of v.a.t. do our industrial  rules go back to British . Does it mean all items sold have eu  regs removed.
Comment348	Why are they giving this swinson such a long interview. Is she an expert on Brexit? Her claptrap is just spin doctoring. Shes sneaky woman wants to get to number 10. Whatever boris does its never good enough according to parliament. Get ready for more chaos.
Comment349	Any chance of those 7 Sinn F√©in votes negating the DUP&#39;s 10 at this extraordinarily crucial time for Ireland, northern Ireland and Great Britain? No chance. Will this brexit deal get through the House? We&#39;ll know soon enough. Foreboding clouds are gathering.
Comment350	Sad thing is the eu could of worked but they started getting greedy and piss taking
Comment 350.1	Could&#39;ve and not could of. Even I know that, despite my grammar generally being terrible. The EU is doing fine, so you&#39;re wrong there too! Any problems with the EU&#39;s economy are for the same reason as for Japan, a low fertility rate hence ageing population. Israel achieves a fertility rate of 3.11 so anyone can!
Comment351	Swinson the thicko liberal pleb
Comment352	Jo Swinson is 100% against democracy and is against Brexit whether it&#39;s a deal or no deal. She&#39;s a socialist authoritarian.
Comment 352.1	@Danny King Exactly. They&#39;re more like Social Democrats which is just a slow way of getting a country to adopt socialism instead of going the revolutionary route.
Comment 352.2	Or democracy
Comment 352.3	@cheekyboy5000 They&#39;re liberal democrats in name only. Swinson is the furthest thing from a classical liberal. Show me where she&#39;s ever talked about liberty.
Comment 352.4	She&#39;s in the Liberal Democrats. She can&#39;t be socialist.
Comment 352.5	It&#39;s also because her husband works for a firm that receives funding from the EU
Comment353	At last. The Commons must pass it already, don&#39;t play political game anymore. Respect the outcome of the referendum
Comment354	It&#39;s a good deal better than the previous. If it don&#39;t work out maybe you could get Trump to be next PM. He does wonders.
Comment355	until the house said so.......
Comment356	Bozza gets a deal, massive slap in the face of the remoaners üòÇ, no doubt they will vote it down in a few days time but maybe bozza already knows this and this is part of the plan?, No dealüòÇ
Comment 356.1	Correct someone with a brain well said they will break there own Ben act making it nill and void lololol
Comment 356.2	It might work, its make or brake for Boris, and Nigel is waiting in the wings.
Comment 356.3	Yeah a deal Theresa May got for him a year ago ?
Comment357	The way that parliament should be holding the government to account, is by allowing it to enforce the political legitimacy, behind a referendum, that was promised and put forward years ago. Not voting down every deal that parliament put to it.
Comment358	In boris we trust üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø
Comment359	I voted leave. But I&#39;d bet we will still be here a year from now still in the EU and the whole thing was overturned. Many forget that most, if not all of the MPs in Parliament don&#39;t want to leave the EU even those fighting in Brexit&#39;s corner. So why anyone actually thinks we&#39;re going to leave is beyond comprehension.
Comment360	Thank goodness for that - sick to death of this, let&#39;s get on with running our country!
Comment 360.1	Let&#39;s run the leadears instead
Comment361	A final decision by referendum or a final final decision by referendum or a provisional decision by the people until they get it right no matter how many referendum decisions that may take?????????? They are talking as if they hadn&#39;t had years to sort all this out and it was being sprung on them at short notice!!
Comment362	View TedTalks FaceBooks&#39; role in Brexit and how your being duped. Watch out that when your all broken up in pieces China and Russia don&#39;t walk in as your infighting
Comment363	So what he is saying is the UK¬¥s government is uncapable of working on 2 problems at once...They are like a mono task computer...Also, I didn¬¥t know the EU was forcing the UK not to solve the surge housing prices...poor UK government, trying to help ordinary people but being blocked by the evil EU...LOL

Comment 368.1	Ohh really ? You mean climate madness pffff
Comment369	It won&#39;t get voted thro, Swinson is gutted
Comment 369.1	She knows they fucked up big
Comment370	Brexiteers never happy uncompromising nasty attitude in politics.
Comment 370.1	Robert Kelly My God the lack of self awareness in remainers!
Comment371	&quot;The decision should rest with the public&quot;<br />Yeah.. so why do you keep blocking it? We had the say.
Comment 371.1	@ADZ01982 no, I&#39;m implying that 75% of MP&#39;s consider you to have voted incorrectly, therefore (in their mind) you need to vote again... and this time they&#39;ll make sure you vote correctly by fixing the question to herd you into the right answer.  That&#39;s what&#39;s going on....    So, it really depends on the metal of the British people how they respond to this come the GE.... and future GE&#39;s.
Comment 371.2	"@Aaron Giles true... but you didn&#39;t vote the way they wanted you to, so unfortunately democracy has to be temporarily postponed until you vote correctly.  When you vote the correct way, then they will fully implement the democratic result.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPOwWnGcp44"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPOwWnGcp44</a>"
Comment 371.3	@Sarah Andrews you don&#39;t understand sarcasm then? :)
Comment 371.4	@joe caterman Osbourne and Cameron were EXPLICIT when describing what would happen if we left the EU without a deal. The vote was binary, yes/no, there was approx 26,000 (if memory serves) people who &quot;voted wrong&quot; and their ballots were disqualified, every other vote was fine.
Comment 371.5	@Kevin H We should have been told in 2016 what leaving meant. We know now that NO means:<br /><br />Not staying in the customs union and accepting WTO terms;<br />Rise in food prices and tax rises after Brexit; a hard border between NI and ROI, the future of the NHS etc.<br /><br />You can&#39;t just base a major decision, which will largely affect the working and middle class of our country, on a simple YES or NO vote.
Comment372	Swinson is a vile woman . She and her husband benefit from being in the EU . Grunting with their snouts in the EU trough
Comment373	Jo Swindle doesn&#39;t intend to vote on anything but remain. Same as the rest of the remoaners.
Comment 373.1	BeGood 2Me how is this a good deal? Genuinely
Comment 373.2	@BeGood 2Me Maybe cos there is no good brexit deal. It does not exist
Comment 373.3	Exactly. It could be the best deal ever but she won&#39;t vote because she doesn&#39;t want to leave.
Comment374	What a STUPID woman. We have a deal and Juncker says NO EXTENSION and she is happy to leave without a deal. HORRIBLE woman. Liberal democrats are DONE!!
Comment375	Why don&#39;t you island of Man as back stop it middle of Ireland and great Britain
Comment376	I don‚Äôt know why I even watched the BBC expecting an impartial viewpoint on the Brexit issue. We just ended up with a belly full of Swinsons doom and gloom. BBC News is beyond a joke!
Comment 376.1	I mean absolutely no one, zilch.
Comment 376.2	hello how are you keith?
Comment 376.3	No one who voted leave voted based on economics
Comment 376.4	Totally agree with that!
Comment377	Shouldn&#39;t the person also be held to account for their actions, so lib dems and co. Since 2002 or indeed earlier did you feel passionately about anything? <br />Go back to scribbling with crayons is my advice, you have lied, cheated and are going to be found guilty of crimes that happened in Rotherham .
Comment378	Show me a good deal or a better deal and I am more than happy to leave EU, as I am a freethinker and not a fanatic. I&#39;ve watched for 4 years as a good deal turned into a bad deal, to then become an even worse deal. I just want the best for me, my country and its people, as I am not a fanatic. What are you?
Comment379	Labour against it again corbyn you are a joke.
Comment380	God that stupid cow really gets on my tits. Nothing but remainer traitors
Comment381	So a no deal exit it is then.
Comment382	Jo... Bag of hot air... Swinton... Who&#39;s husband has a company in Europe and its all about protecting him and herself
Comment 382.1	Dirk Smith Whose husband has a company in Europe..? Yes, quite a lot of them do, seeing as the UK is in Europe...
Comment383	I call a Vote of getting her a damn Toothbrush..... My frogs teeth are cleaner than hers shame.

Comment387	this parliament won&#39;t pass this new deal, like the old one.<br />they want a new ref.
Comment 387.1	But then if Remain win and I don&#39;t like it I WANT a third one, or until I win. Hey, I&#39;m just using Remainer&#39;s logic! :)
Comment388	She accuses him of trying to rush. Right.
Comment 388.1	@Baa Humbug <br />I agree Ireland should  be able to leave so we are going to cut the mooring ropes &amp; push it out into the Atlantic Ocean
Comment 388.2	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZgzUNbYk_o"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZgzUNbYk_o</a>"
Comment 388.3	@Baa Humbug I am gonna guess they can take a vote. In general i think any part of the UK can take a vote in the same way that scotland did. It would just take the same process. I do think that they would leave if such a vote had taken place during the brexit proceedings.
Comment 388.4	North Ireland should be able to leave the UK.
Comment 388.5	OVER THREE YEARS WE HAVE BEEN DENIED OUR DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS TO LEAVE THE EU.<br />LIB-UNDEMS ARE GONE<br />REMAINERS GONE<br />DRAIN PARLIAMENT<br />VOTE BREXIT PARTY

Comment 397.1	Is that sourthern Eire?
Comment398	Jo Swinsen. What a wretched and nasty piece of work she is. He husband is set to lose millions of Euros from the despotic EU. No wonder she is so desperate.
Comment399	Swinson if you are a Liberal DEMOCRAT then honer the 2016 DEMOCRATIC vote to LEAVE by 17.4 Million  voters.
Comment400	Here we go again labour liberal democrats and biggest bunch of waster the SNP   are going to vote the deal down corbyn you are a disgrace and a traitor to every one the voted to leave   let have a election and sack all the MP that have no respect for the people of this country and for showing us just how meaningless are votes are
Comment401	But it‚Äôs not agreed though, otherwise why would the EU be wanting to grant an extension?!?!?
Comment 401.1	Juncker has said there&#39;s no need for an extension as a deal has been reached. Parliment could vote it down and force him to write a letter to the EU requesting an Extension till January next year but I think they&#39;ve had enough. Two thrids of MP&#39;s voted Brexit into law, and now they want to play hockey pockey for the next 10 years, noones got that kind of stamina.
Comment402	Crap get out
Comment403	Perhaps the BBC could ask a remainer a difficult question in a while? People are starting to think they don&#39;t want Brexit!
Comment404	She calls the deal economic vandalism and then admits she hasn&#39;t seen the legal text.
Comment 404.1	Lazy writing, that‚Äôs what it is! Unless they wanted to add a self-contradictory character that feels morally superior. But then they should have given her more of a back story. Like that ‚Äòher husband gets paid by the EU to stop brexit‚Äô nonsense some other fanscript wrote on this blog, but something a bit more believable. <br /><br />Maybe we get a flashback and see how her mother was killed by a conniving duo of a buffoon clown and a maniacal prankster dressed in a top-hat.<br /><br />Overall, though, I do like the direction this show is taking. Will buffoon clown and evil Victorian do away with scruples and morality in the country? Will Comucyst flip-flopper make off with the no. 10 seat. Will we get a cliff edge ending or a last minute save?...Exciting!
Comment 404.2	@Baa Humbug But they don&#39;t want to.
Comment 404.3	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZgzUNbYk_o"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZgzUNbYk_o</a>"
Comment 404.4	probably about 95 per cent of comments are made without seeing the text!!!!!!
Comment 404.5	So in fact this is Mays deal, but without the backstop (so the original EU proposal) and everyone is fine with it? I just saw Reese-Mock praising it in the commons .... . So many things are still included that no one deemed acceptable earlier this year, but now Johnson has (seemingly) carved in. Despite he just wants the commons to vote for it, because this is the only way around the Ben act for him and the way to &quot;no deal&quot; (and Tax avoidance and so on). The deal is a trap and the ordinary british people should thank their parliament for fighting FOR britain.
Comment405	What is the fall back option in 5 years time if there is no active Northern Ireland assembly. The assembly has  being closed for the past 3 years and no sign of it opening soon.
Comment406	If remainer mps dont accept this deal then it must be no deal .
Comment 406.1	@Oli Cansdale its undemocratic to ask people to vote again without the original being implimented. Imagine labour won a general election and parliment said no vote again?.
Comment 406.2	@Oli Cansdale .......Which we had, in 2016.
Comment 406.3	Or a people&#39;s vote.
Comment407	Even a sniff of the UK leaving the European union and the Pound goes up!!.... Another Millennium Bug Hoax
Comment408	Another stitch up
Comment409	Oh yeah, ask Jo undemocratic Swinsonü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£if the EU promised everyone in the UK a million quid each she would still disagree. IT&#39;S NOT ALL ABOUT ECONOMICS.
Comment 409.1	GARYPUSSY that is so true
Comment410	If the DUP does not back this deal, then they can next face IRA ripping their guts. Because UK will exit EU no matter what.

Comment 411.4	@Boomer Galactica Looks like you are not alone.
Comment 411.5	@Seer Seerwealth Predict what you want,  there was no guarantee about this vote. Bo Jo lost again. I&#39;m delighted.
Comment412	Bojo says its an excellent deal, what do ya leavers think of him now?
Comment 412.1	They won&#39;t pass it in parliament and there&#39;s no extention so..... No deal it is borris knows these so called hatred for the mear classes was there achilles heel well done borris
Comment413	How can Swinson slate a deal that she claims to be so important before even reading it. She is a walking contradiction.<br />         Do as i say not as i do the s***s so deep you cant run away.
Comment 413.1	@stephen morris She is somebody, and you are a loser, toothless nobody ! I can understand why you are mad! Not her fault!

Comment 414.2	Hi; I am good, thank you.
Comment 414.3	hi how are you?
Comment415	No wonder the EU is alright with this deal - it&#39;s even worse than May&#39;s one. Taking back control... Lol.
Comment 415.1	@Lauren Henley You don&#39;t get a near-overnight drop in hospital death rates because of funding - you do when you stop overworking workers, no matter how educated the type of worker  (doctors, nurses et al). Hence, removal of worker-protection in this deal makes it worse than May&#39;s.<br /><br />As for EU expenditure vs NHS funding - the two are not closely linked. There&#39;s currently huge amounts of wastage in the system that has zero to do with the EU (my mother runs a PCT, so I have first hand experience of this).  Moreover, once EU checks and balances are removed, drugs will begin to sharply increase in price. There isn&#39;t capacity in the system to pay for that increase in capital outlay, so provision will be refused via the NHS, and the cost passed on to the end-user if they can afford it (hint- you can&#39;t afford it), and eventually lead to insurance company-led healthcare a la America.  Again, I suspect another &#39;Tory aim, as their interests are aligned with big business, especially insurers and reinsurers as they are such heavyweight financial investment bodies - no guarantee they&#39;ll remain based in the UK after Brexit though, ofc.
Comment 415.2	@Jimsy there&#39;s more hospital deaths from lack of funding to the NHS because we spend it on the EU. ONE THING BEFORE THE OTHER! We need to fix this <b>1</b> pressing issue which is our involvement in the EU and then we can get on to domestic laws, but right now it&#39;s a matter of life or death for our nation and our culture! Let&#39;s focus on getting us OUT first :)
Comment 415.3	@Lauren Henley You can&#39;t see beyond your nose.  Worker protections don&#39;t only protect the worker, a simple example - you can see the dramatic reduction in hospital deaths pre and post-Maastricht, as doctors were no longer working double or triple shifts.<br /><br />Rather than I think less, perhaps you should think more.
Comment 415.4	@Jimsy well maybe those people should be working harder instead of needing socialist &quot;protections&quot;. government shouldn&#39;t be too involved in people&#39;s lives anyway, it always ends up wrong. stop overthinking stuff :) even if we do get worker protection from Tories or we don&#39;t, that&#39;s NOT the point! the point is that we finally leave the parasitic EU once and for all!
Comment416	The last chapter of the UK starts!!
Comment 416.1	Not for me I profit from a no deal because when they vote it down it will be to late for extention and the Ben act actually becomes void we&#39;ll played borris never send a split ass to do a man&#39;s job
Comment417	Fuck of with a second referendum
Comment418	Jo Swinson, the people HAD their say 3 years ago, now do what the people have voted for !!!!!!!!!!!
Comment419	Options: Deal or No-Deal! Let&#39;s call the Banker, 39 Billion is the offer! Waaaaaaaa! This is the only way the EU will get its 39 Billion. They will not give an extension as this deal is the best they will offer under these circumstances and the only way to get or money. So it will be Deal-No-Deal or Election. Labour fears an election and won&#39;t agree the deal (Rightfully so as neither will Jo Swinson and her rabble),  so it will be a No Deal! Lovin it!
Comment 419.1	I was right in my prediction as you can see! Now another prediction. The vote in the house tomorrow will accept the deal, as anything else would mean a no-deal Brexit or an election along with really pissing the populus on both sides off which I would love personally.
Comment 419.2	I was right! The EU will not extend! The choices are as above! Deal or No-Deal, but the other option is to call a no-confidence vote and an election or just agree to Johnson&#39;s repeated cries for an Election. Nevertheless, it is the opposition that will be on the defense and my thought is that many in all parties will see that the game is up and they have to agree to &#39;this deal&#39; or face a NO DEAL BREXIT!

Will The PM have to Regenerate by the end of the series? They&#39;ve already used two of their regenerations.<br /><br />What about the Parliamentary spinoff series, <i>The House of Lords?</i>
Comment423	UK i wanna leave the EU, but we do need you.
Comment424	BBC is clearly the propaganda arm of the anti brexit 5th columnists
Comment425	Jo Swinson = anti-democratic, globalist, career politician, middle-class, privileged, intolerant traitor. BBC of course only interviews their own Remoaners. BBC = scum. Never pay the licence fee.
Comment426	Yessssss
Comment427	The EU &quot;Shill&quot; Jo Swinson will turn down anything Boris brings back because she wants to overturn a democratic vote so her husband can continue to receive the ¬£3.5 million he gets via his &quot;Transparency International&quot; Company (the irony!).  Then the corrupt Jo failed to declare it.  Traitors selling out the UK for EU backhanders.  I wouldn&#39;t trust her to tell me grass was green.
Comment428	BREXIT as soon as possible!!! Take the control of your own country.üí™üí™üôèüíîüíî
Comment 428.1	@Abi Extocapan No, it doesn&#39;t. Give examples of what EU control in our country?
Comment 428.2	Yes ,It does. If you gonna have independence  is better be out of the EU.  100%üí™üíöüíö
Comment 428.3	News flash: The EU doesn&#39;t control our economy.
Comment 428.4	@Boomer Galactica is a bot

Comment430	2nd referendum. The Brits deserve it.
Comment 430.1	The people already voted 3 times.
Comment 430.2	@Tom Hulme üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòä......but the EU have made everyone else vote twice and I am slightly worried about these cowards in parliament and a rigged question. I would be happy with a deal or no deal second referendum.
Comment 430.3	Democracy is majority vote rule accepted by all implimented 1st time. Asking people to vote again without the original vote being implimented is not democratic.
Comment431	C&#39;mon folks, you dont help the country. This is better than no deal, well done EU and UK, just sign it and move on!
Comment 431.1	too many factions to please
Comment432	Boris the traitor ?? What has he given away to the EU ?? Probably his own mother. Give up sovereignty over N. Ireland ?? Have the Brits had enough of weak, corrupt, incompetent politicians ?? To judge by Juncker and Barnier, Boris has kissed their arses.
Comment433	We the Majority of Stay MPS &quot;demand&quot; that you brainless, uneducated peasants of the pathetic UK will obay and accept our best judgement
Comment434	Nobody talks about immigration. This was a big thing in the referendum. The Northern Ireland phone book will be full of polish plumbers but chlorinated chicken will only be available on U,K, mainland. What a great deal!!!
Comment 434.1	It&#39;s potentially actually far worse than this. Countries half way around the world are able to ship food stuffs to england and sell for cheaper as their costs are so much lower. Good for consumers pockets, not so good for farmers. But it depends on how the Brittish Parliment handles that issue, things may be fine.
Comment435	There is only one referendum that i want and thats an independence referendum for Scotland, we don‚Äôt need another Brexit Referendum England will vote to leave again there has been nothing to show England and Wales have changed their minds
Comment 435.1	@Desmond Alloffo a lot of my family is English and when Scotland claim independence we will still be the best of allies with everyone in the United Kingdom, i love England i love the culture i&#39;ve visited hundreds of times never been to Wales or NI but do want to in the near future but for me independence is about Scotland finally having a voice, as Brexit shows no matter what Scotland votes for we get outvoted and in turn have to put up with things we never even asked for in the first place like Tory governments. It can become so depressing when you&#39;re voice clearly doesn&#39;t have any effect what so ever. Independence will give us the powers to make sure Scotlands voice is always at the fore front of our politics.
Comment 435.2	You moan about the english, but we english like the scottish, i think you shud be able to leave the u.k if thats what scotland wants but you should remember alot of us english have scottish freinds and relatives and we consider you a great ally so before you vote please bare that in mind
Comment436	I don&#39;t trust liar Boris one bit but if it is true that it&#39;s going to be zero tariffs, <br />Then maybe he pulled it off last minute, <br />If people aren&#39;t going to oppose it just for the sake of it, <br />We have to see the details, <br />It&#39;s this or No deal, <br />Trying to get a new referendum is going to put Boris in government if this is extended, <br />Unless labour can pull a miracle by winning the election, as no way Library Dems will even be able to form a coalition. <br />Boris has appeared more Farage and has all the Brexit voters in his pockets now.
Comment437	GB is simply too divided in opinion/agenda.
Comment438	Okay then, good job. Let&#39;s have a confirmation vote by the public to see if we agree and let&#39;s get this mess over with.
Comment 438.1	What happens if remain win? Then it will just go for ever.
Comment439	We don‚Äôt want a deal
Comment 439.1	@Sarah Andrews I&#39;m tired of lazy people, find and read it or believe what you want, I couldn&#39;t care less, and with that, I&#39;ll bid you farewell.
Comment 439.2	@Aaron Giles Can never answer a straight question or comment...:)
Comment 439.3	@Sarah Andrews He OP&#39;d another post, look for it or move along.
Comment 439.4	@Aaron Giles Since &quot;Kevin H&quot; isn&#39;t in this conversation, you can repeat your comment to me here. You can&#39;t complain about us moaning since that&#39;s ALL YOU&#39;VE DONE since 2016.
Comment 439.5	@Sarah Andrews If you want an answer to that go read my response to @Kevin H .. Don&#39;t let the tub of butter between you and the keyboard deter you from loooking.
Comment440	British lawmakers : We respect the will of the people<br /><br />also British lawmakers : *refuse to sign any deal leading to Brexit
Comment 440.1	@Name Surname They should have voted then, instead we get this non stop brexit drivel from every news outlet in the country. Remainers shouting we don&#39;t care about the 17m votes to leave, Leavers shouting we don&#39;t care about the 16m vote to remain. We had a vote, we lost. Next time exercise your right to vote.
Comment 440.2	Name Surname Don&#39;t talk such bollocks! If every Brit had voted my arse...what including babies infants and criminals? It was the LARGEST vote in British democratic history you cretin!
Comment 440.3	If every brit voted, we would have remained. Thats why you dont want a 2nd referendum. Because you know this.
Comment441	PLEASE!! Let‚Äôs just leave this fkn European Union !! Parliament is not fit for purpose.....drain the swamp.
Comment442	I just cant believe how this silly woman has the nerve to want to cancel Brexit by all means possible, when the majority of the referendum voters, voted to leave!  Can this party please delete DEMOCRATIC from their title immediately!  If Mogg has declared this is a very good solution, because he has perused and read the &#39;deal&#39; then it cant be the same as May&#39;s deal or anything like it!  The reason being that  Mogg absolutely hated her deal, and thought her the worst PM ever!    So this must be much better and a reasonable solution.  However NI still don&#39;t like it, and Boris needs 10 votes from them in order to go ahead.
Comment443	Is this a deal?
Comment444	The DUP should have been asked to draw up the border arrangements then you would know that they are remainers wanting  us to stay in the customs union.  What alternative have they / shows how useless the whole exercise has been. If we don&#39;t have No deal on 31/10/ Boris has wasted billions / luckily the Corbyn Swinson alternative is so bad he may live to fight on. He will not have the grace to resign as leader that is for sure.
Comment445	This is not a deal, its Boris&#39;s no deal just as he wanted. He has tricked those fools. Yellowhammer crash on the way, Boris and hedge fund pals, laughing all the way to the bank. Well done Brexiters. Dis-unity Britain, we will never forgive or work with you.
Comment446	BBC news and channel 4 are just like fox news in America. Crap
Comment447	Wow she is a waist of air..... I did hear they will soon be rebranded as the UK Communist Party.
Comment448	And immigration??
Comment449	NO DEAL NO SURRENDER
Comment450	"turn off the sound and readthe subtitles instead around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWl1xl-7uJw&amp;t=1m54s"">1:54</a> much more interesting"
Comment451	Part 1 done...well done Boris... now when those tossers (swinton / corbyn &amp; the like ) don&#39;t agree it ... get us the *uck out of there without one. Swinton,  your completely barking !
Comment 451.1	Yep they will break the Ben act lolololol
Comment452	I just hope that all the politicians, from all the parties, can respect the vote of the British people and get this thing done, finally!
Comment453	the welthy alite fithing for the&#39;re economy.....
Comment 453.1	i Take it you skipped school on the days that spelling was on the Agenda. seriously why even degrade yourself by commenting when you cant spell ?
Comment 453.2	?
Comment454	Great Achievement of PM ,Boris Johnson , I wish all success of PM ,Boris Johnson .He is a talented man of UK.
Comment455	What is that LibDem woman rambling on about, she&#39;s not even seen the deal.
Comment 455.1	And have you seen the deal?
Comment 455.2	Matthew Morris correct
Comment456	I&#39;m still 100% WTO, he&#39;s given something up. What was it? Our military?
Comment 456.1	@TheDarkSide292 What makes you think I disagree with them? I think in the short term, 5 years at least, it will be incredibly painful for everyone, well, not the rich obviously, but especially those at the lower end of the financial spectrum. I think 5 years might be overly optimistic, didn&#39;t JRG say that we wouldn&#39;t feel the benefits for 30 years? <br /><br />So no, I don&#39;t disagree that short term is going to be painful for a lot of people, but unless those that voted to leave pick up their placards and march on Westminster demanding we re-enter the EU, we are at the mercy of democracy and the machinations of politicians.
Comment 456.2	@Aaron Giles lol. Oh so all the economists and think tanks and business leaders all don&#39;t know anything about how brexit will impact us. They&#39;re just farting in the wind, right? Jesus.
Comment 456.3	@Aaron Giles I couldn&#39;t have said it better myself. Thank you for supporting democracy.
Comment 456.4	@Kevin H Well, I voted for remain, but hopefully leavers will the exit agreement they want. Noone can see the future, odds are evens we do well if we leave or stay, so pointless doomsaying for leave/remain is just folly. Short term will be painful, beyond that everything else is just farting in the wind.
Comment 456.5	Yeah, I heard that the EU army has permission to operate air bases and naval bases all around the UK.
Comment457	Labour, Lib Dems and SNP will vote against the deal purely on the basis that it&#39;s been negotiated by the Tories.  They put party politics far ahead of the national interest.
Comment458	If she won ¬£30m on the lotto it wouldn&#39;t be good enough.
Comment459	Why is Swinson asked anything? Come on BBC show for once that we&#39;re not interested in lists and traitors. Get it together.
Comment460	Watch your local ditches
Comment461	Lib Dems are the most anti-democratic party we have ever seen
Comment 461.1	@William Peterson <br /><br />They could only achieve that IF THEY WERE DEMOCRATIC ALLY ELECTED. <br /><br />How is that any different to the Brexit Party pursuing a no-deal Brexit, because no majority voted for that either?<br /><br />But if they got elected on that manifesto they would have earned the democratic right to do so.<br /><br />It&#39;s the definition of democracy.
Comment 461.2	@Arfur Fuxxakes The liberal democrats has said that they would ignore the will of the people if brexit were voted for again. That&#39;s undemocratic.
Comment 461.3	No, they&#39;re not.<br /><br />They could only enact their Remain if they were elected to do so, democratically. <br /><br />Just like the Brexit Party would only consider Leave if ever.....<br /><br />Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha Hahaha <br />Sorry, ahem.....<br /><br />.....if ever they got......<br /><br />Hehehe hehehe hehehe hehehe hehehe hehehe hehehe hehehe hehehe hehehe <br /><br />......ELECTED.
Comment462	Omg what a disaster we are still in so still run by EU and one world government
Comment 462.1	@Sarah Andrews - what?! 1st you say it is about immigration, once you see EU immigration go down in proportion to world immigration going up, and you realise an economy needs an expanding workforce, and your policy is, let us say, a little racist. Then it wasn&#39;t about that, was it? Then it was about the money, but then you learnt a good deal will have you worse off and a no deal will have you much worse off, the poorer you are the worse it gets. But no, it wasn&#39;t about money, was it? Then it was about sovereignty, until BoJo was such a Twot he made a new law? The argument isn&#39;t if we leave the world will fall apart, it is that we will be worse off. Yet you still want it, why? Fanatical maybe? I am open to leave, if you can convince me of benefits - and get you have failed to do that in 4 years, why?
Comment 462.2	Assad runs the one world government, they&#39;ll be round for you shortly.
Comment 462.3	‚Äã@mark grant I think you&#39;ll find that&#39;s your side spouting ill informed ideology.....all I&#39;ve heard from Remainers is &quot;We&#39;rE gOinG tO sTarvE&quot;.....really now...lmao
Comment 462.4	@Darryl Weathers I don&#39;t give a single shit for your fanatical thinking. Convince me how leaving is better for me, my country and its people and I am 100% with you. Till then you are just a fanatic spouting ill informed ideology.
Comment 462.5	@mark grant If you dont think the EU isnt the prototype one world government thats your opinion but i suggest researching it.
Comment463	Well fuck them all - if they dont like it then we fuck off out with NO DEAL. Well done Boris.
Comment464	DUP- NOP!  LABOUR- NOP!  SNP- NOP!. ERG-NOP! who exactly will vote for this?
Comment 464.1	@Jacob Jorgenson nope read the small print go YouTube right now lbc radio nigel our next pm is talking about it
Comment 464.2	@Mark Shepphard wrong wrong wrong. The Boris surrender act is subject to UK parliament vote which will never be won. Benn act holds up and Boris needs to send the letter Sat.<br />And btw, The Boris surrender act leavers UK fisheries as there were and huge payments to the EU stay the same. You nothing kiddo, FUCKALL! HAHAHAHHAHA
Comment 464.3	@Jacob Jorgenson wrong the Ben act gets broken by the hands that wrote it read the full act well played borris he knows they won&#39;t vote it threw and way to late for anything else the EU won&#39;t extend so no deal it is lolololol
Comment 464.4	@duprattcarol because if above don&#39;t vote for it in parliament , it ain&#39;t happening. <br />Boris simply caved so he can go back to the UK and say &quot;I made a deal&quot; and then the simpletons, I mean brexiters can blame the duo, SNP, labour . Brexit was never about Europe, it&#39;s about inequality , suppressed anger and uneducated miserable people
Comment 464.5	What the heck is the political fight for power in the UK got to do with the EU? All because stupid, unrealistic promises were made before the referendum. Then again, we will see if the 27 members back the reajusted deal.
Comment465	Blah blah blah Jo!!!!
Comment466	DUP will get vat benefits and a millions in cash .
Comment 466.1	It&#39;s the only way to get the DUP on board with anything. A truck load of cash.
Comment467	Won&#39;t happen. Powers that be never wanted to leave EU and didn&#39;t expect us to vote to leave. This is organised chaos to make it look like are trying to leave. We won&#39;t leave!
Comment468	Lib dems just don&#39;t want to agree anything no matter what it is. Awful people. Smug little cow
Comment469	How come Jo keeps shaking her head no when she says that yes pairlaiment should vote on Saturday lol.
Comment 469.1	@Coz Kott they will then break there own Ben act making it nill and void no deals on route he nos it that&#39;s why she isn&#39;t her normal self she fucked up BIG
Comment 469.2	Because she wants the opportunity for Parliament to vote the deal down so that Boris has to ask the EU for an extension therefore giving the remainer parties a chance to revoke Article 50 through the process of a general election. It&#39;s all part of the long game.
Comment470	This video is like asking a vegetarian if they like the taste of kfc she&#39;s against the practice and made a decision even before looking at it properly
Comment 470.1	The liberal undemocrats in their delusional thinking will end up getting a no deal, <br />The frustrators and traitors party.
Comment471	How many mps do liberal democrats have ?????<br />Again BBC propaganda..........by the way , talking about threat of jobs??.....shame they never mention the de industrialisation which has been implemented/forced on this country over last 40yrs !!
Comment472	So what&#39;s the deal?
Comment 472.1	hi jaafar
Comment473	Swindon the wrecking ball!<br />Seen no text yet but ten minutes of apocalyptic doom and gloom  nonsense.<br /><br />It&#39;s simple she wants nothing other than a second referendum with two options.<br />1) Remain.<br />2) Remain.
Comment 473.1	James Sempy because some leavers want no deal and will complain about if a deal is excepted, other leavers want to remain because this is not the deal they wanted and don‚Äôt want a no deal, remainers just want a second referendum. <br /><br />This way everyone body gets a say in the outcome and direction of the country, no one can complain about the result because everyone knows what they are voting on and what the outcome will be. <br /><br />Then we can all just get on with our lives and not mention brexit again!
Comment 473.2	@Mini Mead3 <br />how about a ref to choose between:<br />1.  a deal<br />2.  a deal
Comment 473.3	Lib Dems referendum options<br />1) I ‚ù§Ô∏èkids and the planet . In!‚úîÔ∏è<br />2) I&#39;m a racist. Sell NHS. Out ‚ò†Ô∏è<br /><br />So that seems fair then.
Comment 473.4	Steven Moore how about a referendum with no deal, Boris Johnson‚Äôs deal &amp; remain, on it and if the combined total of no deal and Boris‚Äô deal is more than 50% then we do which ever has the larger share out of those two. <br /><br />That‚Äôs pretty fair right, then then the country decides what brexit we have rather than these dumb struck crooked MPs!
Comment 473.5	so does Nicola CAVIAR.
Comment474	Jcj looks as though hes shit himself
Comment475	I&#39;m greatly enjoying watching the reflections in Jo Swinson&#39;s necklace
Comment 475.1	I agree.  As I have recently taken up art again I think it would be  quite challenging to draw and certainly more interesting than listening to her drivel on.
Comment 475.2	There‚Äôs certainly more depth to those reflections that the woman wearing it
Comment476	Don&#39;t the LibDems realise we already voted? Wow they are desperate haha
Comment 476.1	@Jacob Jorgenson No I understand fully thankyou! =)
Comment 476.2	You still don&#39;t understand how all this work huh?
Comment477	what in the hell is going on in Britain lol
Comment 477.1	@Aaron Giles yup we really shook the pillars
Comment 477.2	@Mark Shepphard It&#39;s all in the reflexes.
Comment 477.3	It will get better but we could do with a very fast car and a stunning women to ride shot gun.... No anyone who&#39;s a trucker brother
Comment478	Theresa May&#39;s deal was about 90% identical to this..<br />Apparently, no one knows what they want.<br /><br />What a joke.
Comment 478.1	@Lance William Tsuji not saying I disagree.
Comment 478.2	90% is not 100%<br /><br />The real joke are those who always cry about democracy but don&#39;t want to honour a referendum result which is a democratic process
Comment 478.3	Tell us more you seem to have read it already cover to cover.  Amazing!
Comment 478.4	Abdulla Ali I agree üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØ
Comment479	What a pile of bullshit. Force us out lol we voted for it 3 years ago you idiot. Where do you find these fools üòÇ
Comment480	You voted to leave just leave you don‚Äôt need another vote if that is the case doesn‚Äôt Scotland have a say in this we want another independence vote we should have a say in brexit too
Comment481	üç∫
Comment482	Boris got a deal because of his threat to walk with no-deal....shame on all those MPs who voted against a no-deal.
Comment483	Bloody Brexit, it&#39;s never ending. I&#39;m rapidly losing the will to live. Anybody out there feeling the same?
Comment484	Swinson is a DO-NOTHING so-called &quot;Democrat&quot; willing to subvert the will of the people, knowing only how to obstruct. The name of her party is ludicrous on its face.
Comment 484.1	English Gentleman - what is great about remaining? Firstly, non-isolationist politics, you will conduct yourself better in the world without an arrogant attitude. As human beings we have advanced to this level by working in large international groups. The issue that a small man working on his own is going to be better than the collective is a farce. Massive science projects across Europe happen involving energy and space, only possible due to the EU working together. The foundation of the EU was pushed forwards by Churchill after the 2nd World War. The idea was that European countries were in a constant state of war and flux, unification and working together stopped all that, likely a very good idea. Your right to live, work and travel across a large block of similarly minded countries. Business, banking and economy has boomed within the EU, especially for the U.K. I could go on and on, small things like building safety standards, free roaming charges on mobile. Too many an advantage to list. And I do agree that the most important thing about our future is good leadership. Which has always been my strongest argument against leaving. Your own leadership, investment and advancement in tech, and social mobility are the big 3 things that will affect your future. But looking at this government acting like children while the EU have been proper and upstanding hasn‚Äôt convinced me of leaving the EU. In fact over the past 4 years your programme of misinformation has changed me from someone that wasn‚Äôt liking the EU much to someone that wants to end local politics and function under a one nation EU state. You convinced me how important that is now. I could write a whole book on this, if you let me know what your issues and gripes are then I could focus and explain how it will affect you, and why you are ill informed.
Comment 484.2	mark grant The economic  success we may or may not have is dependant on us when we leave NOT the EU deal! And besides economic matters we can decide our own policies as they suit us....that is the part of leaving you ignore and is not dependant on this deal!
Comment 484.3	mark grant Well come on then smart arse what is so great about us remaining?
Comment 484.4	@English Gentleman - because the best deal is the one we have, you don&#39;t get to be out and have a better deal, that is the policy of the non-thinking. Listen to yourselves, not one stepped up to convince me of why we need to leave. You have given up on yourselves, and yet you will still go around spouting your ideology, like a fanatic.
Comment 484.5	@Dmitrii Novikov  - bullshit, the referendum was on record as being advisory. Cameron promised to act upon it, but then quit. So anything promised by that leader is out the window. And that was two governments ago. Move on. Still wanting to be convinced, and that is the best a Russian troll bot can do - you need an upgrade.
Comment485	Are you Brits that gullible as to think Blowhard Johnson, &quot;The Liar King&quot;, is actually bringing something new to the table??<br />The EU has no intentions of giving you your cake and letting you eat it, too! Face the facts:  1. You are blowing-off the EU and quitters do not get what they want.  2. Ms. May got the best deal you will get and there&#39;s not a thing you, nor Johnson, can do about it.
Comment486	A cloud of foreign intrigues &amp; mysteries...
Comment487	Ask Johnson, what specifically will have changed on Nov. 1 . Being specific.
Comment 487.1	@Tommy Barlow i hope for the last sentence you wrote, so i can keep traveling free in the EU to the Isle of Skye with my motorcycle...  enjoying the Scotish landscape, if not, i will visit Switzerland more, there i dont have any border controls too...  and its not even in the EU....lol
Comment 487.2	In a nut shell this deal is effectively  just a continuation of the current rules and regs we are subjected to being in the EU. It&#39;s another 12 months to sort things out off the radar
Comment 487.3	@Tommy Barlow As far as I know the EU were waiting for the UK to ratify May&#39;s deal before they ratified it their end. <br /><br /><br /><br />There is a transition period, between Nov 1st and when we will have to fend for ourselves on WTO, I think it&#39;s 1 year but maybe it&#39;s longer or shorter I don&#39;t know sorry.<br /><br /><br />Scotland isn&#39;t going to quit the UK on November 1st.<br /><br /><br />As for the current dysfunctional state of WTO, if the Tories cannot navigate its bureaucracy, they better have something up their sleeves if the EU deny Article 24.
Comment 487.4	‚Äã@Aaron Giles I doubt they would go straight to WTO terms, and WTO only covers a fraction of EU rules. WTO is currently disfunctional because USA has not appointed a judge to vacant seats in it, the EU is not dysfunctional, and so it trumps WTO in court, no matter what, because the WTO court is backlogged years, and not functioning for this era. <br /><br />Parliament can&#39;t use May&#39;s deal because that&#39;s not the deal just agreed to by the EU. They won&#39;t be going back to a deal that was already binned.<br /><br />Ireland will not go back to significant violence. There will be no border, and UK will still be in the EU for years to come. <br /><br />No matter what it&#39;s called, nothing will have changed on Nov. 1, and over the years nothing much will change. Except Scotland will quit UK.
Comment 487.5	@Tommy Barlow I&#39;m not trying to predict the future here, there is no trade deal with the EU currently, if this deal passes we are on WTO terms, but there is always the chance that leaving on amicable terms with the EU may convince them to agree to Article 24, so we would have an  interim deal until a free trade deal could be agreed to on both sides. If Parliment decides to use Mays deal, then we will have to abide by the 4 freedoms, because the backstop means the free flow of goods, and the 4 freedoms are indivisible. <br /><br /><br /><br />If no withdrawal agreement is voted into law and we leave the EU on the 31st with no such agreement then every paramilitary group in Ireland are gonna be making like squirrels and trying to find where they buried their weapons.<br /><br /><br />The main difference between Boris&#39; deal and Mays deal is that May was unwilling to lose DUP support and place a border down the Irish Sea, not much else in the agreement has changed but this single change creates a significant different outcome.
Comment488	All this shitty never ending news cycle for nothing
Comment 488.1	Kevin L if your going to leave you should just leave cuz the UK will be made an example of now
Comment 488.2	Actually, for the UK, there will be a massive price to pay.
Comment489	The above is an example of someone who should not parent.<br /><br />If actions have no consequences, then negotiation is pointless. Lib dem&#39;s are idiots of the worst kind. UK will become even more of a dystopian nanny state under their guidance.
Comment490	johnson is beginning to look older than corbyn.<br />he looks very haggarrd; that&#39;s either because of him being up at the crack of dawn every day, or the crack of carrie  symonds.
Comment 490.1	i might be transgender, which means it wouldn&#39;t be a sexist comment!!
Comment 490.2	boris likes a bit of  crack before entering carrie&#39;s crack.
Comment 490.3	Stupid sexist comment.
Comment 490.4	Or crack itself
Comment 490.5	bozo is beginning to look every one of his 55 years.

Comment492	my god what a trator! she literally spit in the face of the british people. shame on her and all of her trators mp&#39;s. <br />We the people! Brexit Frexit Nexit üá¨üáßüá´üá∑üá≥üá±
Comment493	WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET OUT THE EU FFS!! Why can&#39;t the commons set out criteria which the pm has to seek with the EU, this can go on forever
Comment 493.1	Because it‚Äôs not the EU stopping brexit and it has never been - it‚Äôs the UK parliament that voted three deals down, had successive votes on ehat type of deal would work for them and voted down ALL options and then legislated against no-deal brexit.<br /><br />More importantly, no party is going to give the government a deal: that would be giving them gold in an upcoming election. Goes for all sides, so you first need to get a majority government and then ensure all your MPs vote your party‚Äôs way... this is all going to last a bit longer üôÑ
Comment494	If Jermey Coban is against this ....then that should be a FAIR deal
Comment495	remain. means saving the NHS from trump

Comment 497.1	Julie Randall did you vote NOT to have trade deals with other countries?  Isn‚Äôt this just a trade deal?  Come make a deal with a Trump.  What does your island have that the USA will want to trade?  Trump will trump Boris any day.
Comment 497.2	"@Sandra Mutch But you lost the vote hun. That&#39;s all there is to it really. Remoaners refused to accept the verdict. They have the brass neck to say the winning side is undemocratic when our own win has never been implemented!!! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23keeponwinning"">#keeponwinning</a> luv."
Comment 497.3	I never voted for no brexit
Comment498	Remain MP&#39;s will never vote for any deal because they are not democratic so that&#39;s why we need a no deal. And as for this woman she should be ashamed of herself telling lies. She should be respecting the vote of the referendum. Why is she getting all this air time by the BBC.
Comment499	This is definitely a deal manipulated by Putin!!

She obviously needs re-educating we already voted üó≥ fairly and the result was fair !!  The people already made their views clear 3 years ago !!
Comment503	hey jo swindon. 3 years is not a rush
Comment504	Think the spirit of things in Europe is to approach things with a view of stronger ties between European nations.  If you know that&#39;d be the approach, where&#39;s the stumbling block? The EU isn&#39;t going to not act like the EU in the future.  It&#39;s not Britain, a place where god knows wtf is happening.
Comment505	Hypacrite that women, the libs just want to stay in the e.u and their saying &#39;let the people decide&#39; although their insisting in their campaigns we stay in the e.u although we voted out!!!

Comment508	So treasonous May lied? She was selling out to the Eu. Maybe she will get a new job like Blair did?
Comment 508.1	Jacob Jorgenson that‚Äôs a hell of an assumption pal. I‚Äôve been a scaffolder for 20years and it‚Äôs people like u that tried to defy the will of the of the people that have caused such a divide. So much so that brits resent idiots like urself as u r no patriot and not even British. I think I speak for most people who voted leave when I say u don‚Äôt like it F off home and take ur bloody globalism and Marxism with u u prick

Comment512	This woman is a treasonous traitor. All the mps that want to stop Brexit are traitors and should be sacked.
Comment 512.1	The people that hide tjeir money off shore are traitors and rob every citizen whilst using the benefits. Rees Mogg moving to Ireland is also a traitor. Hedge fund funders of Brexit who shorted the pound should be in prison.
Comment513	Boris, just present a letter to the EU tomorrow where you ask the EU to sign and agreement that no matter what UK parlement decides saturday, their will not be an extension! Then you will have your brexit majority saturday! If the opposition only have a choice between a hard no deal brexit what they for sure dont want! Or this treaty/deal, most of them they will vote for this one..  And then the 10 votes of the DUP are not importent to get a majority in parlement! Northern Ireland will have until 31 december 2020 to change things with the EU if they are not happy with this deal, and Scotland can have the independence referendum to leave the UK what they so desperatly are talking about the last 12 months. And we in the EU can leave this foolish UK circus behind, and focus on the important things the EU faces in the future! Greetings from Amsterdam! ( Damn.. so late again? Time to go to the coffeeshop )
Comment514	Swinson&#39;s only interested in the EU because she might get caught out. Naugthy girl. She&#39; s a destructive woman that does&#39;t believe in democracy. What does she want us to do vote again, what then is it best out of three. shame on her.
Comment515	When people fear monger, you know they have nothing to offer but self interest ... get on with Brexit and carry out the will of the people or you will live in fear.
Comment516	2 questions;<br />1) what about the 39 billion? ... Still in the deal?<br />2) what time do they start next Saturday?<br />I want to get some extra popcorn and be totally ready.
Comment 516.1	the money was used to bribe EU burocrats to get the deal ...
Comment 516.2	No matter what the UK will pay
Comment517	The lib dems will never vote for anything
Comment 517.1	The liberal undemocrats are deluded in their bubble if they think they&#39;ll win many seats, they won&#39;t be able to team up with Labour, it&#39;ll be SNP and Labour coalition if it is hanged parliament. <br />But most likely because Boris appears more Farage than Farage, <br />Cons will get in just to sort out Brexit.<br /><br />The liberal undemocrats think Brexit crowd won&#39;t vote and they can just be ignored, <br />It&#39;s actually the remainers who are more divided, the loud angry Brexiteers will vote Boris.
Comment 517.2	Like you vote with the libs
Comment518	The jew is a liar. Zionist and marxist jews.
Comment519	No deal is coming
Comment520	very good news.
Comment521	Now there‚Äôs a thing Brexit deal only the government would cut a foot of the top of a blanket sew to the bottom and then tell I‚Äôm with stupid uk people now you got a longer blanket?
Comment 521.1	That makes no sense at all, have you even read what you put? Where is the punctuation? So who is stupid now?
Comment522	TRAITOR LEAVE MEANS LEAVE (WITH NO STRINGS) IF ANYONE BELIEVES IN DEMOCRACY THEY MUST BE MAD
Comment523	An almighty waste of time, money and most ironically of all, sovereignty.
Comment 523.1	Jacob Jorgenson Well EVERY country including yours has its crosses to bear Mr Perfect!
Comment 523.2	What sovereignty?
Comment 523.3	you need more democracy and freedom
Comment 523.4	@Jacob Jorgenson Of course. (Almost) everyone knows this!
Comment 523.5	In hindsight, English tyranny in Ireland was a mistake ?

Comment 525.1	@Mihai Ciubotaru no deal departure on 31st. FUCK THE EU
Comment 525.2	@The BadderMan ...the question is ....Now What?
Comment 525.3	@Mihai Ciubotaru that&#39;s ok. Parliament won&#39;t pass it and then no deal on 31st.
Comment 525.4	At last!!  Boris has reached the May deal, improving it by giving away Northern Ireland!!!
Comment526	"The guy at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWl1xl-7uJw&amp;t=7m29s"">7:29</a> is more positive than her."

Comment528	All this for nothing because Boris will not get the votes, and we go back to step 1 :D ( Need to love this shit ) Big Brother house ( Nation Edticion )
Comment529	Let the show begin.. the British hooligans changed venue...they left the stadiums and moved into the European Parliament..
Comment530	Lib Dems are pro-immigration and want to be part of the EU. So immigrate then.
Comment 530.1	A better solution : England can leave the EU but Scotland and NI will remain... <br /><br />Opps sorry, that is already happening... üòÜ
Comment531	I am tired of remainers get the deal done the Romanians are just making the streets dangerous
Comment 531.1	Muslims*
Comment532	‚ÄúTWITTER‚Äù the fact that Johnson uses it instead of the media, reinforces how much of a trump clone he is üò°ü§¨
Comment 532.1	Media are partisan propagandist hacks.
Comment533	The time for a united ireland is now üáÆüá™üáÆüá™üáÆüá™
Comment 533.1	It wasn‚Äôt very democratic to take it in the first place ;)
Comment 533.2	yeah, lets follow one anti democratic decision with another
Comment534	Dont screw it up parliament. You can see it now all these idiots just thinking about votes rather than pushing the deal through.
Comment535	Swindon is making me laugh. She‚Äôs not even seen the text, but has already, as Corbyn has, dismissed it out of hand. Any self respecting reporter would have challenged her on the validity of her statement which Proves to all in the UK that remainer MPs do not want to honour the referendum which most of them were elected on a manifesto to do.
Comment 535.1	@Jacob Jorgenson I smell a brainwashed socialist.
Comment 535.2	You haven&#39;t read the deal and you are clapping like a fool
Comment 535.3	same with farage
Comment536	AT LAST! After three long frustrating years! AT LAST! Thank you Boris Johnson! AT LAST!
Comment 536.1	@Madame Clark No, I&#39;m not American, I&#39;m British and proud! Lol
Comment 536.2	@Madame Clark I think he is only ...sarcastic..
Comment 536.3	paulmaking1980 thank Theresa May.  All Boris did was tweak her deal.  Boris isn‚Äôt stupid enough to start from scratch, especially since Theresa‚Äôs deal is already EU approved.  All he had to do was negotiate the revisions.  Are you a stupid American?
Comment 536.4	At last!!  Boris has reached the May deal, improving it by giving away Northern Ireland!!!
Comment 536.5	What are you celebrating? May had a deal too. The hard part is getting it through Commons.
Comment537	Jo Swinson is 1 horrible witch
Comment538	"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23RemainInEU"">#RemainInEU</a>"
Comment 538.1	Your name looks very British, we should listen to you. Moron.
Comment539	You wanted out? There you have it! üêç
Comment 539.1	@Elin Grome yes we do. Figgot.
Comment 539.2	No, we dont.
Comment540	Can someone get Jo a dentist please
Comment 540.1	She&#39;s paid 70k a year.<br /><br />She can afford her own bloody dentist üòÅ
Comment541	Sold down the river then.
Comment 541.1	Nope it won&#39;t pass and no extention no deal on its way he knows this there blind hate for the people was there achilles heel that&#39;s why the remainders flew to Brussels saying they would agree to the deal but the EU over played there hand watch
Comment542	bojo sold the country a lie, now he want to cut up the union, what happen to no deal clean break brexit<br />i still remember how vile and nasty toward&#39;s the last PM, and he&#39;s doing the same thing and all his gang are clapping and cheering
Comment543	Will be interesting to see which remainers do not support Michel Barnier&#39;s and the EU&#39;s deal .. will they forsake the EU&#39;s agreed course of action? They will be responsible for &#39;no deal&#39; if they do .. let&#39;s hope so !!
Comment544	Boris Donald Johnson/Trump has not agreed a deal between the EU and UK he has agreed this GREAT deal with himself and EU. Wait till weekend then ask the EU for an extension followed by throwing yourself in a ditch and die.
Comment545	how about the 39 billion? are these slags gonna get their grimy hands on it?<br />this transition period [ 2020] after that are we COMPLETELY FREE?<br />can we then make our own trade deals?<br />have we surrendered any fishing rights?
Comment 545.1	The EU gave more concession, because NI is tied only in agriculture. The rest of VAT and excise income would be bagged by UK unless the goods got transferred to ROI.
Comment546	Libdems: its too hard <br />Brexit party: its not hard enough<br />SNP: ive naw read it but its shite<br />Labour: its bad but i cant tell you why
Comment547	And now the UK parliament will block the deal. At least, hopefully so. Any deal is bad for the UK long term and No Deal is suicide.
Comment 547.1	Suicide for Ireland.
Comment 547.2	Sven Tempest the people voted already, nevermind what you think is best
Comment548	Congratulations Prime Minister. Regardless of the result of the vote on Saturday you have expertly crafted a win-win situation for democracy in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and have most certainly secured yourself a healthy majority at the next General Election. Rise, Boris the Blade.
Comment549	31 October. Party time.
Comment550	I do hope Britain will give the EU the middle finger on the 1st of November. <br />Brussels are nothing but blood sucking leechs.
Comment551	How is it different from May‚Äôs deal?
Comment 551.1	Deal has us leave on WTO terms, end of freedom of movement, power to make our own trade deals. What @Sean Lycnh said is also true, it&#39;s basically the same deal they offered May but she rejected. So ECJ would probably still have power in NI but am not sure on how ECJ works so take that with a massive grain of salt.
Comment 551.2	nothing. this deal will be rejected by WM, like May&#39;s ....
Comment 551.3	NI  are aligned to EU in customs union
Comment552	Labour will only back a deal with the EU Single Market within it as they want to keep their voters flooding in to the UK!
Comment 552.1	Actually no. They will only back a customs union agreement.
Comment 552.2	labs + DUP won&#39;t vote the deal .... means NDB.
Comment553	Thats a good boy ! America said no borders with IRA and UK listens
Comment 553.1	Elin Grome internet troll dum dum
Comment 553.2	@Lassa Complex I&#39;m comparing UK to a good dog that listens to its master
Comment 553.3	@Lassa Complex ORANGE MAN BAD
Comment 553.4	BTC 3J8faXJCDKKS6AKvt7KNKhcEsfeKpEAShX what does that even mean?
Comment554	This is May&#39;s deal with a nicer font.
Comment 554.1	@Luke Riise Decent but unremarkable, just as May&#39;s. You can&#39;t thrash one and praise the other. Brexit allows for greater control but that comes at a price. A price most people seem unwilling to pay. The dream you were sold is unattainable.
Comment 554.2	@the BOLLOCKS Actually is not Trump who makes the decision but Bibi Netanyahu..
Comment 554.3	yeah but Trump has not agreed a deal between the EU and UK
Comment 554.4	@Luke Riise<br /><br />NI will stay under the EU umbrella so it is indeed Theresa May&#39;s plan...  And Scotland will want the same.
Comment 554.5	for the Brexit Talibans is worse....you loose also NI!
Comment555	BBC news focusing only on negative reactions.

Comment558	Corbyn and his Traitor Party will prevent us leaving.HE wants to be the hero, by stopping Bojo so that HE can be the one who took us out or kept us in.
Comment559	Build our hopes up then carry on kicking the can down the road till we all get fed up and stay .
Comment 559.1	If UK doesn&#39;t&#39;t exit the EU, you&#39;ll all end up worse than France &amp; Greece
Comment 559.2	Not if Juncker is anything to go by. &#39;There will be no prolongation&#39;.
Comment560	Liberals will be triggered
Comment 560.1	By keeping Irish unity???
Comment 560.2	Bad for you commie
Comment561	94%of UK businesses don&#39;t trade with the EU but are affected by the rules.. Who is the deal for... Public don&#39;t want one
Comment 561.1	absolutely
Comment 561.2	thats a lie
Comment 561.3	How much money Putin pays you? Troll üòÇ
Comment562	Its really unfortunate that political lightwieights are allowed to lead before they have been groomed properly, she sounds like the typical snowflake mentality her ages shows her to be. Go to university for longer and let heavyweights deal with our futur
Comment 562.1	@Sven Tempest no just pay your dues like will all do experience give you wisdom no short cut to that, this is why the world is in a mess
Comment 562.2	&quot;Young People are bad because I&#39;m old&quot;<br />That line of thinking has always been and will always be bunk.
Comment563	God bless Brexit üòòüòò.
Comment564	tbh id rather stay in a leadership position in the eu rather than become its vassal state but hey that&#39;s just me
Comment 564.1	@Kevin H i mean we&#39;re gonna be influenced by it regardless (even with a total no deal just out of sheer economic prowess of the EU bloc), but until now we&#39;ve had our say at least. we&#39;re about to lose that
Comment 564.2	@Kevin H PaedoKev

Comment569	If Parliament want to further stop this after this deal has been struck then forget even trying to get another deal before 31st
Comment 569.1	North Ireland should be able to leave the UK.
Comment570	This whole thing is a joke I&#39;m beginning to think parliament don&#39;t really want to leave why drag this thing on it has been going on for three years now to be honest it is just a waste of time in my opinion a deal has been agreed but it&#39;s not a done deal in parliament smh
Comment571	He&#39;s done the best he can.if parliament can&#39;t agree it then Boris will break the law and leave with no deal. Don&#39;t worry Boris .no jury will find you guilty
Comment 571.1	I WILL LEAVE MEANS LEAVE THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY IN BRITAIN
Comment 571.2	He got a deal, he no longer needs to push back Brexit if the deal is declined by parliament. Its either this deal or no deal.
Comment 571.3	This is exactly what we&#39;ve been discussing this morning. Fingers crossed!
Comment 571.4	Referendum result was clear.. Machiavellian obfuscation not withstanding
Comment572	Funny, All those mps he refused to listen are waiting for Boris now on Saturday to show him, it is his deal not UK deal ,  all what he did to Theresa May is exactly happening to him now.
Comment 572.1	@Mark Shepphard Well, the wording of the Benn Act stipulates that parliment must agree to the deal, but as you&#39;ve mentioned elsewhere in the comments of this thread, either the EU will say no more extensions or France/Hungary will veto the extension. I&#39;m a Brit and originally a remainer but even I&#39;m sick of this crap, two thirds of those MP&#39;s voted Brexit into law and now they want to play cat at the door not sure whever it wants to come in or stay out, can&#39;t leave the countries future up to those fools. Get Brexit done, we can rejoin if it&#39;s an unmitigated disaster.
Comment 572.2	Nope he&#39;s played um because these clowns will break there own Ben act there for no deal brexit go on borris lolol played like a fiddle that&#39;s why she&#39;s not screaming and going at it clever as fuck they won&#39;t except it the Ben act becomes nill and void lololololol

Comment573	It&#39;s Theresa May&#39;s dreadful deal in disguise. Like a smelly big fat pig BUT with bright red lipstick on its lips added
Comment 573.1	@Greenpoloboy3 Neither can I, problem is, if they vote against it they are voting FOR a hard border in Ireland.
Comment 573.2	@Aaron Giles I cannot see this passing with this parliament
Comment 573.3	Video implies WTO, no Customs Union, no ECJ, this is the exit deal, trade deal will have to be sorted after.
Comment574	Bye bye workers rights
Comment575	But we were told it couldn‚Äôt be done the EU would not renegotiate...... Boris did turn in to Hulk I guess
Comment 575.1	Unknown Driller You are so naive!
Comment 575.2	Take it and move on to other issues like knife crime. Domestic abuse. Police, NHS. Schools, armed forces, upgrading some fire stations you know the real issues guys ? !
Comment 575.3	*Blob, fixed it for you OP.
Comment 575.4	@Supernova Noooooooooo! The Ulster Protestants will not be happy.
Comment576	Lib dems will always be negative no matter what&#39;s happening.
Comment 576.1	So ture thay  need to be stopped
Comment 576.2	The lib dems are snakes who can never be trusted. Jo Swinson hates Jeremy and Boris. But from all accounts hates Corbyn even more. Who will they side with after the next election. It will be a numbers game.
Comment 576.3	Because they don&#39;t want to leave the EU and will not accept any deals.
Comment 576.4	Aye
Comment577	DUP bigots will kill it yet. They know whats good for UK. Who cares about unemployment, mortgages or peace in NI.    &#39;Ulster oligarchs say NO!&#39;
Comment578	Parliament won‚Äôt want to pass it they will want a referendum on the deal v remain. No no no the deal v leave.
Comment 578.1	@joe caterman they can&#39;t other countries will Vito they no as much that&#39;s why they agrees to a deal
Comment 578.2	@joe caterman How can a referendum be a stitchup? You have been telling us for years that the result of a referendum is the will of the people. None of this &#39;deal&#39; is going to happen anyway.
Comment 578.3	@catherine duffy EU just playing political games unfortunately... EU would offer extension.. but want to force a stitchup referendum.
Comment 578.4	It looks like we will leave on wto, Eu says no to an extension, Parliament are going to say no to a deal so wto it is.
Comment 578.5	Cant trust eu for a deal how the hell can they trust us to remain best going to get still got to cooperate need to ratify it and leave.
Comment579	The EU agreed to plans before then Brits STILL couldn&#39;t manage to get it done.üòÇ

Comment580	The UK is going to regret not being part of the EU.<br />The UK politicians are like a bunch of rebellious teenagers who come from a dysfunctional family... Rebel without a real cause!
Comment 580.1	let the show begin..the British hooligans changed venue...they left the stadiums and moved into the European Parliament..
Comment 580.2	It&#39;s better to leave EU and wait for next election when all these leaders will be dwelling on roads without votes
Comment 580.3	We are still in the EU with this deal. The EU is centralising mess
Comment 580.4	A bit of a bad analogy. People from a dysfunctional family have a lot to complain about. But I agree with your sentiment.

Comment587	All the Brexit party voters in here need to understand that if you don‚Äôt vote torie you won‚Äôt get Brexit. It will split the vote because farage will never Get a majority be realistic.
Comment 587.1	@Swurvin Creations good, I want to get my hands on leftists with no government to protect them.
Comment 587.2	Voting tory is basically asking for the country to be caught under a mass austerity program again. The reason public services are so bad in the UK is because of the tories. If you vote them in then you are voting for the last 10 years of government.

Comment 589.1	@Lassa Complex Nice one.
Comment 589.2	Look at 1000 years of history including now. Ireland has always been abused by England. You have it the completely wrong way around. Don‚Äôt destroy a country inside out and expect them to lie there and take it. It is finally time for justice for Ireland . And England is getting what it deserves.

Comment 599.1	@Beatsboxdre Beats<br />Borders have always been within the UK&#39;s control. The notion that your products won&#39;t adhere to EU rules yet will still be exported to the EU is, to be blunt, stupid.
Comment 599.2	@Beatsboxdre Beats Actually no. If N.Ireland stays in alligment with the EU you are basically cutting out a part of the UK that, in time, could bring Unification with the Republic of Ireland closer. If this deal stands. The Republic of Ireland and EU will have scored a major victory and the UK over the years , will become smaller.
Comment 599.3	abugina we will control over free trade deal, our own regulations and our own borders
Comment 599.4	It‚Äôs going to VAR, that being parliament.
Comment 599.5	Its the same deal. In fact the EU got what they wanted 3 years ago. Alligment of N.Ireland  with the EU.
Comment600	Roll on 2nd ref let the people decide
Comment 600.1	@catherine duffy A lot of people forget about Cameron&#39;s pre-referendum negotiations and how the EU arrogantly said &quot;No.&quot; They all thought we&#39;d never vote &quot;leave&quot;.
Comment 600.2	Chris Mack we have to leave. End of
Comment 600.3	Chris Mack yes! Leave leave leave
Comment 600.4	Its what we call DEMOCRACY
Comment 600.5	They have already decided in the referendum. Leave. Deal or no deal.
Comment601	Parliament doesn&#39;t want the UK to leave - could be the greatest deal of all time - makes no difference! Parliament doesn&#39;t want UK to leave.
Comment 601.1	@phil mill   We&#39;re remaining.<br />No choice.<br />GFA.
Comment 601.2	@phil mill  # Elijah Cummings.<br />RIP.
Comment 601.3	Xjay1234. Don&#39;t know if your from usa? What you said is accurate because the military is tied in to europe. Something usa under appreciated but at the same time really doesn&#39;t .<br />Usa isn&#39;t really that good, sadly main Europe thinks it is also which isn&#39;t that good.<br />Trading outside the European union will be good for the uk.<br />Stay safe xjay1234.
Comment 601.4	THRICE RE-heated gammon pie. To go with the chip on the shoulder.<br />Thankyou PELOSI.<br />Johnson set to be impeached and removed.<br />Ball&#39;s in America&#39;s court now..<br />MUELLER long game in action..

Comment604	He&#39;s just Theresa May in a blond wig. FRAUD
Comment 604.1	The scumbag remainer MPs are stopping brexit.<br /><br />That&#39;s why nothing gets done.
Comment 604.2	No it really isn&#39;t. Johnson&#39;s new deal gets rid of the backstop.
Comment 604.3	Chris Wheatley shut up and stop repeating farage talking points boris has done well
Comment 604.4	Kinda like this whole world don&#39;t you think Chris?
