Comment18	Good morning CANADIANS 🙋✝️💜<br />HAPPY MONDAY 🍁🇨🇦, lol<br />Interesting much can be when we UNDERSTAND the LUDICROUS ITY of our humaniod HUMANITY. 7 BILLION MUTANT MONKEYS, SHEEP FOLLOW MINDLESSLY. <br />MY THANKS TO JUSTIN FOR LEGALIZING MARIJUANA AS A POT HEAD I AM.

Comment19	Canada is a complete joke,  so a total idiot PM is fitting.
Comment20	By far the weakest and PM in history, can’t stand that guy
Comment 20.1	Savage in the 6 - Are a Russian troll?
Comment21	Sad how Canadians will vote for someone that makes empty promises and then vote them in again based on more empty promises. Canadian voters are pathetic and stupid. They prefer familiar lies to unfamiliar truths. He never ever had any intention to balance the budget. Just tell people what they want to hear.
Comment 21.1	@aaronl19 True... time to seperate...
Comment 21.2	At least Alberta and Saskatchewan knows what a dimwit Trudeau is
Comment22	Who cares, Justin Trudeau is only a politically submissive Canadian harem boy of &quot;Caliph&quot; Donald Trump in America. Oh Canada and greetings from Northern Europe, from partly arctic EU-Finland.

Comment28	Should be in Hollywood great actor.... really missed his vocation in life....Politics well that a fuck up for all us all.
Comment29	Canadians have barely seen Justin&#39;s wife, Sophie, at all in the last year or so.   Guessing the marriage, at this point in time, is just for show.
Comment30	Hippies, refugees, welcomed terrorists and carbon taxes = more affordable? Hmmm...
Comment31	Justin Black Face Trudeau
Comment32	George Orwell&#39;s Animal Farm anybody?
Comment 32.1	"Political Correctness is Orwellian because those who enforce Political Correctness use Orwellian Newspeak and Doublespeak that is described below:<br /><br />Newspeak is the language of Oceania, a fictional totalitarian state and the setting of the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), by George Orwell. To meet the ideological requirements of English Socialism (Ingsoc) in Oceania, the ruling Party created Newspeak, a controlled language of restricted grammar and limited vocabulary, meant to limit the freedom of thought — personal identity, self-expression, free will — that threatens the ideology of the régime of Big Brother and the Party, who have criminalized such concepts into thoughtcrime, as contradictions of Ingsoc orthodoxy.<br /><br /><br />Doublespeak is language that deliberately obscures, disguises, distorts, or reverses the meaning of words. Doublespeak may take the form of euphemisms (e.g. &quot;downsizing&quot; for layoffs and &quot;servicing the target&quot; for bombing), in which case it is primarily meant to make the truth sound more palatable. It may also refer to intentional ambiguity in language or to actual inversions of meaning. In such cases, doublespeak disguises the nature of the truth. Doublespeak is most closely associated with political language.<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />When they say it will kill the Fetus they are in truth using Orwellian Doublespeak because the word Fetus is in truth Latin for child/offspring.<br /><br /><br />So in truth they are saying it will kill the child/offspring while using Orwellian Newspeak and Doublespeak in order to distort the truth in order to also force everyone to deny Christ Jesus and force them to exchange the truth for a lie that denies biology because Man cannot become Woman because the Man&#39;s DNA will always reveals him as biologically Male.<br /><br />Woman cannot become Man because the Woman&#39;s DNA will always reveals her as biologically Female."
Comment 32.2	1984 as well.    Trudeau is shutting down critical media.....wrongthink ya know!

Comment41	Justin Trudeau takes the longest steamiest piss in the faces of the Canadian citizens and they vote him in again. It&#39;s hard to respect such masochistic gimps. Canadians, I hope that you are overwhelmed by third-world immigrants, your education system is overrun with Marxist SJWs, your socialized services collapse and your economy goes down the toilet. You have no right to a country if you elect a Communist psychopath as your leader. RIP Canada.
Comment 41.1	You totally nailed it. God help us all.

Comment 75.4	@luke shaw There are no centrist parties in Canada.
Comment 75.5	&gt;&#39;cuz a centrist minority govt. w/ progressive parties (ndp /bloc) holding the balance of power gave us things such as universal healthcare

Comment84	congratulations  congrats to mr Justin Trudeau  And All Canadians we proud of you and believe unity ou all Canadians  together. we need you to work and drive our country property and wealth insha Allah
Comment 84.1	@TheDark Nite Real Canadians care about the economy and whine when the government is obviously doing a bad job. Not jobless uneducated people who spread misinformation (things like &quot;Scheer Cuts&quot; or &quot;conservatives will ban abortion and ban gays if they get elected&quot;), or people who support a leader who breaks the law in office and letting terrorists into the country
Comment 84.2	@aaronl19 WAAHXIT LOL. Real Canadians don&#39;t want to separate or whine about Ottawa&#39;s 24/7. Just entitled white men with no education.
Comment 84.3	All Canadians eh? Have you seen Alberta, or Saskatchewan? Also unity? Have you seen WEXIT. <br /><br /><br /><br />Praise Allah btw

Comment90	Canadians should not be allowed to govern themselves. Suery
Comment91	We lost our democracy in Canada since 25% of our population is foreign born, you think you have immigration problem in the UK we are being ethnically cleansed faster than any other nation.
Comment 91.1	@TheDark Nite Toronto Built by non whites lmao
Comment 91.2	@CanMan1000 Canada is built by non-whites. Go to booming Toronto and see who does the heavy lifting and go to Alberta and see who does the heavy whining!
Comment 91.3	Maybe you can return to Eastern Europe or Russia. They hate the environment and love racism. Perfect for you!
Comment 91.4	CanMan1000 <br />What does &quot;building&quot; mean?

Comment 93.2	Arnie2-D2 boot polish
Comment94	Now embarrassed to call myself a Canadian.
Comment 94.1	@TheDark Nite &quot;  Eastern Europe always lacked civilization&quot;   You have been poorly educated. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungry produced many scholars and advanced civilization. Tough neighborhood though. Muslim to the south, Asian hoards to the east. The USA saved the British/Dutch empire because the alternative was horrendous. We did make them to agree to give up their colonies. In hind sight a mistake.
Comment 94.2	@Khadr Trudeau They weren&#39;t Nazis. Doesn&#39;t matter though, Eastern Europe always lacked civilization. We saved these Europeans from Hitler. Why??????
Comment 94.3	@TheDark Nite You forget the long bleak lines. The wasted lives. Maybe they will forget in a few generations and returned to socialist hell.
Comment 94.4	@Khadr Trudeau Both are shitholes. East Europe wasn&#39;t bad until they replace Communism with racist Christian identity. Now it&#39;s Christofascism!
Comment 94.5	@TheDark Nite Have you been to Australia ?  I thought not. Hint it&#39;s wide open. Eastern Europe, give them a chance they are still recovering from Justin&#39;s Fathers dream.
Comment95	Aww he lisps😅
Comment 95.1	@Dan S You mean like when Trump slurs, and mispronounces during his lacklustre &quot;speeches&quot;?

Comment 95.4	No he doesnt
Comment96	THESE ENGLISH COLONY STATES ARE THE SAAAME ,INTACT , AS THEY WERE WHEN THE LANDS WERE OCCUPIED BY THE BRITISH <br />RACIST STATES<br />NO MORE
Comment 96.1	@Kerman Koonekerman No problem....Now crawl back to whatever 3rd world country shit you out...
Comment 96.2	@mhffc IF YOU HAD AN ANSWER TO THE FACTS I MENTIONED ,YOU WOULD PUKE TRASH HERE ,<br />GET LOST
Comment 96.3	@Kerman Koonekerman Have you ever thought of getting some medical help. You seem to have some serious mental health problems..
Comment 96.4	@mhffc excuse me ,you may  hav childhood nostalgia about the RACIST STATE OF CANADA , but i didnt know this term applies to any other , <br />if we dont point out and set clear ,I am afraid british consience rules out Chinese Hong Kong is racist
Comment97	THE FACT THAT A RACIST PERSON IS THE CHAMPION OF THIS ANGLO-CANADIAN STATE ,<br /> PROVES CANADA IS A DANGEROUS RACIST STATE
Comment98	Congratulations Mr. Trudeau. I called your office today to ensure that you understand that the gift of this second term you have been granted needs to be the time that Canada takes true action when it comes to the climate crisis. I sincerely hope that your focus will be on environmental issues over the next four years. The Liberals will not be granted another chance in the future if the effort is not put into cleaning up our atmosphere and oceans, specifically. That means no new pipelines and paying attention to your indigenous treaties as well. This was a narrow win. Prove that you deserve to represent our country on a global scale; prove you are capable of taking action. I have faith in you, Mr Prime Minister. Please, stand with the youth vote. Please, stand with and for all Canadians that are severely concerned about our changing planet.
Comment 98.1	Are you on some sort of drugs?
Comment99	GET YOUR T1Ts OUT 🍀🍀🤡🤡🍀🍀😈
Comment100	No face paint or mask?<br />Oh wait they have a few minorities up there...<br />And  ignore and abuse the indigenous people of Canada...
Comment101	RIP Canada
Comment102	With this, you probably realize world&#39;s elections are sham. Elections were designed to perpetuate the delusion of control they have with votes, politics and everything. <br /><br />I voted Trump, and now I realized.
Comment 102.1	@Will Pack <br /><br />None at all, literally. The results would same if you voted otherwise.<br /><br />Edited: I voted for Obama, Hillary and other candidates in the past, though. A waste of time. I&#39;d recommend you people to secure yourself firearms, but don&#39;t shoot yourselves in the foot. Lol.
Comment 102.2	@Will Pack Brilliant as long as it&#39;s Trump who asks him to do it.
Comment 102.3	How does it feel shooting yourself in the foot?
Comment103	Someone should turn up in black face

Comment 104.2	We do not want that @ss clown as our President.  He looks good, talks a good game just like Obama.  We are still trying to dig out from Obama&#39;s mess.
Comment 104.3	Giyan Vice <br />And fill the streets with the worlds garbage ?
Comment105	A sad day for peoplekind.
Comment 105.1	@Bryan Ouellet <br />I BET YOU DO !!!
Comment 105.2	The only time religion has ever behaved morally, is when its had to answer to secularism.
Comment 105.3	@Brian Smith The last person that should be around children is somebody like you, I have more than a dozen homosexual friends I&#39;d be thrilled to have as babysitters. Sexuality doesnt define people, their manner/behaviour/philosophy does. That&#39;s why you hate strangers, youre hateful, arrogant, and brainwashed by charlatans.
Comment106	Is Canada trying to out-do Sweden?
Comment 106.1	@Bryan Ouellet yep, thats the word i was looking for.
Comment 106.2	@Supreme Snek subtle?
Comment 106.3	@Bryan Ouellet Honestly its more Democrats, or at least Dems are more open about their raping. GOP might be a lot more suttle in their raping.
Comment 106.4	@Supreme Snek Sounds more like the GOP
Comment 106.5	@Bryan Ouellet <b>Wonderful Exciting Vibrant Diversity Of Rapes</b>

They also gave him a pass on trying to influence a criminal case, firing the attorney general. Well, at least the islamists are happy today...JT is their fave.

Comment 153.1	Your intelligence is a hoax. Xoxoxo
Comment 153.2	Meags<br />Hello sir
Comment154	Canada is not a democracy. 1. an unelected queen is the head of state. 2. Governor General is unelected. 3. Senate is unelected. 4. Prime minister is not directly elected by all the voting public 5. All the provincial premiers are not directly elected. The queen wears the pants in Canada and holds veto power over all bills proposed to become law. She is the one that dictates the laws that govern Canada, not you measly subjects. She lets you vote to make you believe you have a democracy. It makes the bowing a little easier on your knees.
Comment 154.1	@Captain America Russia is trying to destroy all liberal democracies and Christian/Right voters are helping them. Failed in Canada;)
Comment 154.2	TheDark Nite - You Dems are still looking for imaginary Russian conspiracies. Trump has been tougher on Putin than Obama was. When Ukraine asked for military aid to help fight a Russian invasion, Obama only gave them blankets and tents. Trump gave Ukraine anti tank weapons and other lethal force weapons to knock out Putin&#39;s tanks. .
Comment 154.3	@Captain America Better than Trump making our laws by letting Putin tell him what to do!
Comment 154.4	Apparently you are okay with the queen dictating your laws. You are a pathetic sheeple.
Comment 154.5	@Captain America  If it&#39;s to stop commie infiltration, then she can vetoe all she likes.

Comment 156.1	Kapten Krok equality exists in the United States. You just want to suck the governments tit for services. America is for anyone who works hard.
Comment 156.2	RedWave 2019 yeah the US is better for you if you&#39;re a straight white male. Every other person is just fucked. And the fact that Canadian children don&#39;t get massacred in schools. The wages are nothing when u have no equality.
Comment 156.3	@claronium 780 Yeah, everyone should vote for &#39;big government&#39; and just give effeminate dimwits like Trudeau as much power as possible and thereby restricting their own freedom. Your problem is; you&#39;re jealous and hateful of the wealthy, which ironically funds the left. You&#39;re a total pawn! You need a hobby.
Comment157	👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Comment158	Canadian nous battle.  Or orgy of who dislikes who more.
Comment159	The only good news about all this is that noone needs to step in to end White Supremacy; racist neolibs and right wingers are going to do the work for us by forcing everyone to adopt western capitalism until it collapses, then white people will learn all the privilege they had once it&#39;s gone, and the rich will understand why their expensive compounds and bunkers are meaningless. I really hope I live to see it.

He&#39;s fraudulent, racist, misogynist, a liar, mentally unfit for president, colludes with foreign powers for his own gains, dismantles environmental protection policies, has incited to violence. Do you want me to continue?

Comment167	Any liberals dislike Justin Trudeau?
Comment 167.1	I&#39;m not a fan, but I am confident this is the right direction.
Comment 167.2	Yes, me.
Comment168	Time to celebrate with some shoe polish on the face
Comment 168.1	@Comic Book Guy Are you asking about Canada or the US?  For my own country, it&#39;s easy.
Comment 168.2	@John Texas you&#39;re suggesting that liberals have made major social and cultural advances (in a good direction)?<br />What advances would they be? Expecting every white Canadian to feel ashamed of their existence as people who merely happen to be white while having been involuntarily born in Canada? Or, the great leap forward to liberate the sexual degenerates (e.g transvestites) FORCING normal people to take part in the sex fetish?
Comment 168.3	@Comic Book Guy I&#39;ll ask you the same question that I&#39;ve asked Americans, and they can never deliver an answer:  share with me (I&#39;m of course not Canadian so don&#39;t know the history) the major social and cultural advances in Canada since WW II that have been introduced by &#39;conservatives&#39;.  Not quibbling over economics or such, but major social and cultural advances.  Waiting--and yes, I will look up your responses.
Comment 168.4	@John Texas He told me: if, as a result of liberals&#39; mass migration/open boarders policies, Canada&#39;s streets end up full of urchins, so be it.
Comment169	And Canada sinks further.
Comment170	Why he isn&#39;t wearing his blackface??

Comment 173.1	@AWResistance - And no perverted male has the right to molest and rape a teenage girl and get her pregnant, thereby derailing her whole life.  No man has a right to get woman be it wife or girlfriend or whatever pregnant because he  wants to trap her into a life of domestic servitude or whatever.  I live in a progressive country that allows women the choice and control over their own bodies...a hard won right that no man shall take away because it threatens his masculinity or whatever.  While I would never have one myself, it is not my place, any more than it is yours or any man&#39;s to determine what another woman does with her own body.  More often than not there are economic reasons why a woman may have the need to terminate a pregnancy because to bring a child that she&#39;s not financially or emotionally equipped to raise, a grave injustice to that child.  That is why there are so many broken people, why there is so much child abuse and what have you.  Perhaps when you agree to male castration so women can be safe from likes of these perverts, and rapists then message me back.   In the mean time, don&#39;t bother me any further.  Thank you very much.
Comment 173.2	@laurajames723 Abortion isn&#39;t a right, it&#39;s a government granted privilege. You don&#39;t have the absolute right to choose, you have the right to meet the government&#39;s criteria of when, how and why an abortion can take place. For example: you don&#39;t have the right to choose an abortion after 24 weeks, and you don&#39;t have the right to have an abortion outside of a safe facility. So your &#39;choice&#39; is limited. And no i don&#39;t believe God sent Trump, in fact, i find him rather annoying.
Comment 173.3	@AWResistance - He supports a woman&#39;s right to choose and he&#39;s anything but Satanic.  Project much tRumpster?  Are one of those who believes that God sent tRump?  Well I&#39;ve got news for you, sure he did...because he was all out of locusts.
Comment 173.4	He&#39;s satanic, he&#39;s supports baby murder.
Comment 173.5	Yay mainstream
Comment174	I&#39;d like to congratulate Trudeau on becoming Canada&#39;s first black PM.
Comment 174.1	LOL
Comment175	Conservatives in Canada made the same mistake the democrats are making now. They focused too much on hating their opponent and not enough on finding a decent candidate.
Comment 175.1	and...while they were focusing....they were using their amygdala.
Comment 175.2	@Christian V-H Don´t forget he failed miserably in the greatest land deal since Alaska and the Louisiana Purchase,  not being able to make Greenland the 51st star on the American flag!
Comment 175.3	@Wonders Idi Amin, Khadaffi, Nero and Caligula were slightly worse than Hillary!!!

Comment185	Poor Canada, got to keep putting up with the guy who&#39;s obsessed with blackface and wastes taxpayer money on things like paying off former terrorists
Comment 185.1	Blackface? I don&#39;t think you understand how make up class works. Must really hate the Alt-Right Bernier hangs with then!
Comment 185.2	Exactly he&#39;s a joke, he cares more about his media image than people in Canada
Comment 185.3	While he supports giving taxpayer dollars that could go to Canadian women and children to bum immigrants that have little to no job skills but are instead given handouts.
Comment186	He is gonna get laid tonight...

Comment196	Remember that old saying:  Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.
Comment 196.1	"@operacrackers   I don&#39;t believe the carbon tax collected goes directly to the UN.   Trudeau says that it&#39;s pretty much all going back to taxpayers.  I call BS on that.  And, Trudeau does contribute a lot of our $ to the UN, so it goes there, even if indirectly.  <br /><br /><br />Here is what I just googled:<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.taxpayer.com/news-releases/b.c.-emissions-keep-going-up-despite-the-highest-carbon-tax-in-canada"">https://www.taxpayer.com/news-releases/b.c.-emissions-keep-going-up-despite-the-highest-carbon-tax-in-canada</a>"
Comment 196.2	JS doesn’t the carbon tax go to support the UN? That was my understanding.
Comment 196.3	@The Halfcast Podcast   What makes you think he is reducing carbon emissions????   He&#39;s taxing us, heavily, a carbon tax.  And all of that money from this new (and increasing) tax goes into the general coffers, so he can spend spend spend.  Not one penny is earmarked towards pollution.    Justin Trudeau is a fraud of the highest magnitude.
Comment 196.4	@The Halfcast Podcast It&#39;s the style now for cowards on the web to attack political leaders.  No effort required like the old days when these losers had to actually DO something.  We see it all the time around the world.  Just the twenty-first century dark ages--it&#39;ll pass.
Comment 196.5	Expecting what different result, he’s reducing carbon emissions
Comment197	&quot;We <i>will</i> make life more affordable&quot;<br /><br />Thank God. The recent increase in slave prices have gone through the roof. Glad someone thinks of us poor Nike investors.

Comment223	Victory my butt. There&#39;s blood in the water. He lost the popular vote in a country where it counts far more politically than in the United States and he lost the majority. He will be facing major opposition and his personality is not geared for this. Crush him!
Comment 223.1	"Kip McEwen - May YOU be crushed...for that which you wish upon another who&#39;s done you no harm, will be revisited upon you ten times over."
Comment 223.2	Christian V-H absolutely
Comment 223.3	@justcallmejoe T&#39;aime bien Bernier, toi?
Comment 223.4	@Christian V-H les conservateurs auraient gagne avec Bernier
Comment 223.5	@justcallmejoe Calme-toi un peu

Comment 226.1	@Jon Seymour That is true, and you are an amazing racist.
Comment 226.2	@Quillo Mass immigration. Lol. Any other far right stupid talking point you want to share with us ? lol
Comment 226.3	@first Impression nah, you are. He&#39;s a disgusting islamapologist.
Comment 226.4	@first Impression So you vote to get it taken away from you by mass immigration, well done
Comment227	a victory speech after losing seats? and a minority government... riiiiight. not to mention he&#39;s shady as hell. great :/
Comment 227.1	@Lord Voldemort The same thing could be said of Trump or Johnson (by the BBC)...but they didn&#39;t. They didn&#39;t mention the lack of majority in Parliament (they haven&#39;t stopped mentioning it about Johnson), and they didn&#39;t mention the...erm...rather embarrassing revelations about Trudeau in the past couple of weeks...which is exactly the opposite of what they say about Trump (in a similar position).<br /><br />BBC: Biased Broadcasting Corporation.
Comment 227.2	Kip McEwen how is he greedy?
Comment 227.3	@Lord Voldemort He is a greatly weakened PM.
Comment 227.4	He&#39;s the prime minister regardless, get over it!!
Comment 227.5	It was pretty bad that he ran up and began his speech while cutting off the conservative speech. The broadcast should have given him his time just like all  the other leaders had their time. It made CBC look biased :-/
Comment228	Progressive Agenda... I hope Canada get&#39;s what it voted for.
Comment 228.1	Marius Vorster Austerity would fuck us up like it did to the 🇬🇧 UK as a proud Canadian fuck that shit
Comment229	I have a feeling that soon Canadians will regret their decision......
Comment 229.1	Nope. We should have given another majority. Good leader!
Comment 229.2	They already are
Comment230	Best wishes Justin
Comment231	climate change 🤢🤮😫
