Comment3	Tremor map in Puget Sound shows crazy amount of tremors. Huge amount.
Comment 3.1	When does it show this?
Comment4	@ 1 hr. &quot;Dutch&quot; gives good info on how to be prepared for earthquake or EMERGENCY at home..all GOOD..I never have kept hard soled shoes by my bed (usually in closet) but excellent idea! Flashlight too!
Comment5	I have my own idea as to what caused the M2.5 in NC: ever hear of Hot Springs,  NC?  Only a few miles northeast of this quake.  Certainly way closer than any oil/gas rigs.  It&#39;s also smack on the North American Craton.
Comment6	Hey there Dutch greetings from cannon beach,oregon. Have been feeling small tremors quite alot, we have noticed them in the evening makes me wonder when the bigger ones will start. Much love
Comment7	You said Merced correctly Dutch, I used to live there!     Friant is pronounced  Fry ant.  I was just yesterday doing a very cursory look at Merced county for oil or gas wells. I never of any when I lived there 34 yrs total. I know there as been a sinking in Merced County and they are attributing it to water use. 9-12 inches in Merced Country. I will look again, I am very curious to see if it is more the draining of oil and gas rather than water.
Comment8	Every time I see more and more oil or gas wells I AM ASTONISHED!
Comment9	What do you believe to be at cause for the lava/magma to be on the increase in its slouching, to then be hitting bottom of plates?

Comment19	No reports out out in S Idaho Dutch. I wish you were here to witness what me a my husband have as well as my parents.  I could tell you so much more than I already have.  Dutch that hill was NOT cracked.  Much love -
Comment 19.1	@Mary CrandallAlso I googled and  researched about the dirt.
Comment 19.2	@Mary Crandall There is a hill where I live that had no crack.  A large crack goes almost half way up. My husband&#39;s car rocked side to side in about 3 sec near the Snake River.  My garage has fresh cracks going all the way out to my driveway and also crosses like a cross.  Never had this the other day.  My garage had no crack ever. My chair also shook a split of a sec. Hearing booms and my dog is barking.  I googled what a earthquake sounds like and it said a &quot;boom sound.&quot; I have mudclay cracked dirt starting on the ground and progressing further where it was normal dirt.  I also have slight buldges in my yard and driveway.  I don&#39;t think USGS is reporting these eq. No doubt we&#39;re having them.  I think they have it maybe programmed to be set on S Idaho to automatically not report. I could go on about the lake. I have shared with Dutch the hill. He never replied. I&#39;m sure many people send him messages, but it shows he read it. Dutch said Idaho panhandle has 11 magma chambers each the size of the Grand Canyon.  I think we feed the Caldara at Yellowstone.  According to this, Idaho is one huge Yellowstone.  I also found some hard mudclay with rock throughout it under some dead grass. My dog dug a hole and I found red hard lava rock there too. My driveway and yard also has places where it&#39;s getting pitted not from my dog. They are not holes. The cracked claymud I found to be 3&quot; deep. Eq causes it to crack. The color is from heat but now cooled. 2 ft from there I have a sand kind of dirt. Like beach sand.  Most dirt in Idaho is hard and not sand unless you&#39;re by a river or lake.  I googled this and these two different dirts are volcanic related.  Not trying to scare but I&#39;m prepared.  I think we play a big part of Yellow Stone.  Hope this helped.  Thanks
Comment 19.3	I would really like to know more. I have family near.
