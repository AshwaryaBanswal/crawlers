Comment1	spy
Comment2	BBC at work - guy definitely a spy
Comment3	What happened to M,
Comment4	Powerful group that JFK warned of. Tara Q 10520. No more until . M protest IRS.
Comment5	BBC still on the Hillarys Russiagate. BBC what a joke.
Comment 5.1	Well said!<br />They&#39;re running out of shit to spew about Russians and Putin and the made up interference during the election.. <br />BBC - bird-brained brainwashing cult. Nothing but lies, propaganda and nonsense!!<br />Mental!
Comment6	should be happy for still bein alive
Comment7	Did the British visit Moscow and Sergiev Posad?
Comment 7.1	Who ?
Comment8	... a spy!.. play the game... don&#39;t be a cry baby... or, do not play the game.
Comment9	With the level of Russiphobia in the West today the USA/UK media and governments would be screaming 24/7 about this.<br />They aren&#39;t because they know he was busted.<br />The facts will come out at the trial.
Comment 9.1	They aren&#39;t screaming about Whelan because they know there is nothing they can do about it and publicly &quot;demanding&quot; his release would only further humiliate the US and its puppet.
Comment10	SHOCKINGLY!!!!!!!!<br />   BBC Doesn&#39;t mention Whelan was not only ex-military, his career was Commercial/Corporate Security and his charges are for Commercial Espionage.<br />His best defense; &quot;Someone slipped it in my bags&quot; the same defense every heroin trafficker uses.
Comment11	He&#39;s a Spy and Maria Butina is not.
Comment12	He&#39;s a spy.<br />US/UK Govs are trying to hush it up and the MSM are barely mentioning him. <br />If he was innocent they would be using him to attack Russia/Putin 24/7.
Comment13	FYI; Maria Butina was neither charged nor convicted of espionage. She was guilty of being an &#39;unregistered foreign agent&#39; which is historically judged to be a civil offence (deportation, &amp;/or a $ fine..) Her lobbying efforts were an attempt to bridge a union between pro gun rights groups in US &amp; Russia (which is a VERY ANTI-PUTIN position to take, btw) She is the very definition of a POLITICAL PRISONER in the US.
Comment14	Deng Xiaoping said &quot;it takes two hands to clap.&quot; Hey BBC what about Sergei Skripal and his daughter? Where are they ? Why so silent about the Skripals ?
Comment15	When come to British citizen it is innocent but not Russian or Chinese.
Comment 15.1	EXACTLY !!<br />ONE set of rules for US and their puppet - UK, and another for the rest of the world.
Comment16	It&#39;s Cold War again!!!!  kkk
Comment17	He is James Bond!
Comment18	Oh this is the guy with multiple passports; of course he is a spy*.
Comment 18.1	@SISYPHUS VASILIAS lol
Comment 18.2	He&#39;s ex-military.<br />Since the military his career has been Commercial Information Security.<br />Out of nowhere he develops an interest in Russia.<br />Goes to Russia to meet a &quot;friend he met online&quot;... who&#39;s a Spy.<br />Gets caught red-handed with stolen Commercial Information Property.<br />His best excuse; Someone slipped it into my bag when I wasn&#39;t looking.
Comment19	i can look over that..know few ppl including me with more then 3 citizenship&#39;s ..but on top of that to be ex military to visit Russia very often and meet always with FSB best friend for 10 years ..having a pictures from weeding on USB ..and not share them thru other media on the internet ..come on ..thats 99% spy for me
Comment 19.1	His career since the military; Private Contractor; Corporate Information Security.
Comment20	he was definitely a spy and he will rot in Russian prison.currently western spies network in Russia has been tremendously being cracked and the abilities to collect secrets from Russia is nearly to impossible.
Comment21	This is great advertisement for why you should never visit Russia.<br />It is a bannana Republic!
Comment 21.1	Especially if your an asset of mi6 lmao
Comment22	Where are the skripals??????????
Comment23	There is only one problem here for fake news BBC. This guy was caught red-handed  receiving classified information.
Comment24	Today no more journalists and media. Only propagandists like ones of Goebbels organisation in WWII. They are soldiers. Like NATO&#39;s soldiers. But in informational war. So I don&#39;t see anything wrong if this women BBC&#39;s so called &quot;journalist&quot; will be arrested too.
Comment25	He Paul Whelan is a spy I am the Second coming of God! LOLZ!
Comment 25.1	His career was Commercial Information Security. He&#39;s not accused of being CIA. He was caught stealing commercial IP. He was a private contractor and shit at his job, thats why he got caught.
Comment26	Russians are weapons grade stupid.
Comment27	Only 4 passports, sounds kosher
Comment 27.1	@Lucky Circles well im same from EU ..and is a choice it is not a mandatory how many citizenship you want and for what reasons etc
Comment 27.2	@zoki kostadinov I see, that does make sense. I suppose it depends which countries too, whether it&#39;s necessary. I&#39;ve only lived in the EU so I don&#39;t think of it much. Yes I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he was, hope he&#39;s ok though. Hopefully they can do an exchange for someone else &amp; promise not to spy again! Best wishes to you
Comment 27.3	@Lucky Circles its not uncommon at all <br />im ethnic Bulgarian 5-th generation born and live in Serbia and my wife is Danish <br />so i got my  Serbian citizenship bcz was born here ..then took a citizenship from my mother county Bulgaria as im ethnic Bulgarian and got my Denmark citizenship  as im married to a danish citizen(she same got Serbian and Bulgarian one from my side our kids same) there are many ppl like us so aint nothing unique or special<br /><br />myself same as all healthy males we served in Military back in the day so ex military .. i do live in a small town of few thousand ppl where everybody knows everyone and all towns do have policemen and few ppl who work as secretive agents so its nothing uncommon that too(the guy who is working as agent hes 3-4 years younger then me and i know him since we were kids (same as other ppl from town) <br />but thing is secret services from any country they dont arrest nor follow randomly regular ppl nor those random ppl now days transfer &quot;pictures&quot; on USB drives
Comment 27.4	​@zoki kostadinov Why do you have more than 3 if you don&#39;t mind me asking? I&#39;ve never heard of anything like that before.
Comment 27.5	i can look over that..know few ppl including me with more then 3 citizenship&#39;s ..but on top of that to be ex military to visit Russia very often and meet always with FSB best friend for 10 years ..having a pictures from weeding on USB ..and not share them thru other media on the internet ..come on ..thats 99% spy for me
Comment28	hi to all the russian bots in the comments
Comment29	Ooo I love a good game of hostage or spy...
Comment30	He IS a spy. period.<br />out of hundred of thousands if not an MILLION of U.S citizens visit Russia yearly why this individual IN PARTICULAR was targeted ? well BECAUSE HE WAS A F***ING SPY. end of the story stop blowing our heads about him &amp; his stupid story. god dammit.
Comment31	Sound&#39;s fishy sorry but 4 passports why also why make friends with someone in the fsb it all sounds fishy.
Comment 31.1	Why would you need someone to provide photos on a flash drive for a simple day out ?
Comment32	Its really suspect when you have atleast 4 nationalities(british and american) knowing the history between russia and the west. He is a spy and he was outsmarted by the russians intelligence agency. You lose some you win some
Comment33	It&#39;d be strange if he just liked hanging around that stuff.  Interested in the FSB?  Here&#39;s 20 years in prison.  Worse than area 51 trying to fly a B 52 over millennials to bomb the crap out of them.
Comment34	Another payday for the war machine.<br />When will you people wake up?
Comment35	Another payday for the war machine.<br />When will you people wake up?
Comment36	Why it&#39;s ridiculous when russia&#39;s concern about catching british or american Spy
Comment 36.1	usually the other way around
Comment37	Russia has done this more than once. It&#39;s a ploy to gain leverage to have sanctions lifted. While I&#39;m sorry for this mans plight, It was his choice to travel to dangerous places so my empathy is limited.
Comment 37.1	My god, you have swallowed the propaganda hook line and sinker.<br />Go to Russia. I&#39;ve been twice and it&#39;s safer than ANY city in the West. I have never felt safer than in St Petersburg.<br />He&#39;s ex-military.<br />Since the military his career has been Commercial Information Security.<br />Goes to Russia to meet a &quot;friend he met online&quot;... who&#39;s a Spy.<br />Gets caught red-handed with stolen Commercial Information Property.<br />His best excuse; Someone slipped it into my bag when I wasn&#39;t looking.
Comment 37.2	Russia is not a dangerous place,  by  saying that  you show your ignorance
Comment38	RUSSIA BAD<br /><br />ORANGE MAN BAD
Comment39	It&#39;s impossible to know. If he is, it is absolutely possible his family didn&#39;t know. A nightmarish situation.
Comment 39.1	That&#39;s why there&#39;s a trial, the facts will come out then. The US/UK will call in fabricated evidence and he&#39;ll go to jail because he&#39;s a spy and possibly one of the worst in recent history. Remember he isn&#39;t a Gov spy, he was working for the private sector and just got caught stealing commercial IP.
Comment40	I love how every commenter here KNOWS this guy is a SPY. He might be!!..... Or he might be a patsy that a Russian agent used to get a promotion. We may never know for sure. But I like how sure we all are without knowing all the evidence!! Go back to watching Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy knowitalls.
Comment 40.1	@feenfader He&#39;s not. He&#39;s not accused of being a gov spy, just of stealing IP that is Nationaly important. He&#39;s a private contractor working in Corporate Security.
Comment 40.2	@SISYPHUS VASILIAS  Then he is also guilty of being an idiot. Why would a trained intelligence officer make it so obvious?
Comment 40.3	imagine thinking the later is more likely.<br />His career was commercial intelligence. <br />He&#39;s not accused of CIA, he&#39;s accused of stealing commercial IP. <br />He&#39;s a private contractor hired to steal commercial IP and he got caught.<br />If he was innocent the US media would be going beserk
Comment41	If he actually is a spy I wouldn’t expect the family to know anything.  He would operate under a cover story.
Comment 41.1	The family are claiming that they DON&#39;T know anything.<br />&quot;I went to Russia to go to a casual acquaintances wedding&quot; is a cover story.
Comment 41.2	The security services develop assets, he&#39;s probably an asset, that way they just abandon them.
Comment42	Does his American paymasters compensate his sorry ass and family in case of capture?
Comment43	he looks more like spy to me than someone like Maria Butina.
Comment 43.1	Maria Butina was neither charged nor convicted of espionage. She was guilty of being an &#39;unregistered foreign agent&#39; which is historically judged to be a civil penalty ($fine, &amp; deportation) Her lobbying efforts were an attempt to bridge a union between pro gun rights groups in US &amp; Russia (which is a VERY ANTI-PUTIN position to take, btw) She is the very definition of a POLITICAL PRISONER in the US.
Comment 43.2	Good day, I&#39;m Writing this comment with a grateful heart to testify ma boy Friends with Mama Shifah the greatest and spiritual healer who help me with ma marriage.I  will say the truth as it says in Psalms 34:8 seek refuge in God &quot;I had three boyfriends at the time I visited the temple and Mama Shifah put her hands on me. I was a confused, undecided, greedy slut and didn&#39;t know who to discuss with about my cheating ways because I needed money from each of these guys for paying my bills,buying some needs as a woman.<br />&quot;Four weeks before meeting Mama Shifah, I caught a very bad STI known as genital herpes but I didn&#39;t knew where I got it from since I was sleeping with multiple guys. I needed help and change of lifestyle that&#39;s when I started looking for help from a superior since this was now out of my control.<br />I went to the hospital for treatment and this is where I met a nurse who told me that the medics will do a physical cleansing and the disease will be cured but I needed a spiritual cleansing that i had to change my life. She suggested that i should  contact Mama Shifah[+27660362497] that she would help me solve my problem as she had done for a number of people before me in many parts of country so had to take step and i took her advice and requesting a contact for Mama Shifah.<br /> When I got her contact, I made an appointment with her and she invited me over to her temple for prayers. I returned home and didn&#39;t receive any call from any guy asking me to go and meet them.<br />This continued for all the time we said prayers with Mama Shifah and fortunately, no one calls me anymore asking for sex in return for favors and better yet Mama Shifah continued to make other prayers for me in which I succeeded in getting myself a serious job as a real estate agent and no longer needed to use my body to pay my bills yet at first at while i had a doubt when contacting her,may God bless the work of Mama Shifah in Jesus name.......]
Comment44	stupid yank
Comment45	Oh, come on! We aren&#39;t that stupid, if he&#39;s not a spy then pigs can fly! <br /><br />He was ex-military, had 4 passports and was friends with FSB agents. Their protests are almost as bad as the Russians who claimed to be visiting a church in the Skripal poisoning. <br /><br />The English are staying quiet because they know how ridiculous their protests would look!
Comment 45.1	@Anton Zheleznikov man Secret services in every country they dont waste time nor hold someone prisoner for that long if they rly dont have good reason to do that ..secret services they dont arrest nor follow  ppl randomly
Comment 45.2	@Anton Zheleznikov man i have 3 passports  and yes im an ex military too and yes i do have a friend from my town who is working as an agent in police ..so im aware that such ppl do exist ...but that guy was also cough with an USB drive with  secretive things on it ..so no matter how u  look at it he aint an average person ..second it aint that big of a secret that UK USA do spy on Russians and vice versa
Comment 45.3	@dickies docos your idea seems reasonable to me. I&#39;d ask questions, too.
Comment 45.4	@Anton Zheleznikov An FSB agent on its own is one thing. An FSB agent with all the other things, then questions should to be asked. <br /><br />If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, its probably....
Comment 45.5	@zoki kostadinov find such suspicious people can be strikingly many. now, if they had provided convincing evidence, then there would have been no discussion, right?
Comment46	Definitely a spy, thanks BBC for confirming that with your involvement just like that &quot;British&quot; woman the Iranian caught spying, apparently she was trained by the BBC.
Comment47	Good night BBC news world love to absolutely
Comment48	Actors
Comment49	Lets start a war with Russia over this🤪
Comment50	just don&#39;t understand why&#39;d russia blame him if it was thinking he&#39;s innocent. i mean which benefits for russia?
Comment51	While you’re at it BBC how about a programme on the corrupt William (Bill) browder who stole billions in the Ukraine/ russia and is for some reason loved and protected by the west
Comment 51.1	Riaz Hamdan Malik Thank you for your reply I think the people that know the bbc is nothing more than a bird brainwashing cult is growing by the day the more we can enlighten the better
Comment 51.2	GREAT SUGGESTION!! Unfortunately Bird-brained Brainwashing Cult specialise in propaganda, lies and general crap, not real news or truthful reports.<br />I don&#39;t think they&#39;d investigated prince Andrew&#39;s trips to Eppstein&#39;s private orgy island either?<br />I WONDER WHY....
Comment52	What about all the russians arrested and imprisoned in america?<br /><br /><br />Of course there will be people from cia in russia, doing who knows what? Stop trying to claim, americans are neutral.<br /><br /><br />America should look at how they arrest russians, and force russia to respond in kind.<br /><br /><br />I am sure there is plenty of americans in russia whom are watched. I am sure there is plenty of russians in america whom are watched.<br /><br /><br />America forced this guys arrest, by arresting russians in america. Russia only arrested this american, due to how americans were arresting russians in america.<br /><br /><br />America likes to bully countries
Comment53	They caught him red handed in a sting operation so yeah hes a spy.
Comment 53.1	yep<br />He&#39;s ex-military.<br />Since the military his career has been Commercial Information Security.<br />Out of nowhere he develops an interest in Russia.<br />Goes to Russia to meet a &quot;friend he met online&quot;... who&#39;s a Spy.<br />Gets caught red-handed with stolen Commercial Information Property.<br />His best excuse; Someone slipped it into my bag when I wasn&#39;t looking.

Comment 55.5	@Awesome Avenger No you say Russian regime admits it so where ? unless your a liar.
Comment56	AMEN. <br />AMEN. <br />AMEN.
Comment57	The fact that the American government are getting involved makes me think that there is perhaps a little truth to Russia&#39;s claims. It seems a little weird otherwise. I know he has US citizenship aswell, something seems off about it.
Comment 57.1	i know few ppl including me with more then 3 citizenship&#39;s ..but on top of that to be ex military to visit Russia very often and meet always with FSB best friend for 10 years ..having a pictures from weeding on USB ..and not share them thru other media on the internet ..come on ..thats 99% spy for me

Comment 62.4	@Brambl What you read are my views, I am paid 000 pounds by the  Russian  government.
Comment 62.5	What about Kashmir? BBC......
Comment63	Taiwanese often say: Do not suck lick a China Communist dog&#39;s penis.<br />This means surrendering to communism.<br />The Republic of China （ROC）was established in 1912, the Republic of China participated in the Second World War, is the United States ally. The Republic of China upholds democracy and liberalism。However, Mao Zedong hopes to promote communism and Mao will establish the Red Army. Betrayed to the Republic of China。But Mao Zedong with the help of the Soviet Union. Established in 1949 in the People&#39;s Republic of China（PRC）。The Republic of China fled to Taiwan。<br />Taiwan&#39;s sovereignty：<br />1600~1624 Belongs to the Spanish colonial<br />1624~1662 Belongs to the Holland period,<br />1662~1683 Belongs to Zheng Chenggong period, is China Ming Dynasty.<br />1683~1895 Belongs to China&#39;s Qing Dynasty. 。Manchu not Chinese。<br />1895~1952 Belongs to Japan.<br />1952~~~～ Belonging to the ROC jurisdiction<br />The Qing Dynasty in China ceded Taiwan to Japan. Japan and the Second World War surrendered in 1945. 。In 1951 Japan signed the San Francisco contract with the consent of the United Nations (renounced) its sovereignty over Taiwan. Japan did not let Taiwan return to any country.<br />The Chinese Communist Party（CCP） betrayed the Republic of China（ROC） and the United Nations also betrayed the Republic of China. 23 million people in Taiwan like democracy and liberalism. Therefore, those who read this article should not betray the Taiwanese people. It should not be said that Taiwan is part of the （CCP）.Your country surrendered to the (CCP). Follow the one-China policy of the (CCP).<br />🔴&quot;one democratic China policy&quot; can bring peace to the world 。<br />🔴《one China policy》will trigger the third world war.<br />The CCP is a cult organization.

Comment 64.1	😕
Comment65	In this case, only 1 possible scenario: double spy<br /><br /><br />:Thonk:
Comment66	This is why you don&#39;t travel to Russia. Made up charges for political leverage.
Comment 66.1	@Proselytizing Orthodox Pentecostal Trans Rabbit Says someone who has never been there
Comment 66.2	@sudipto chakraborti I  have never felt safer than when I ws in StP. I started off worried about my wallet and 3 days in I was roaming the streets after midnight looking for bars :) I had an awesome time and felt silly Id let myself get convinced that Russia was dangerous.
Comment 66.3	Yeh the 2million foreigners that visit Russian every year, all now sitting in gulags as hostages.<br />St Petersburg is the safest place Ive ever been.<br />Stop being programed by corrupt media, visit Russia, have a great time and make up your own  mind.
Comment 66.4	@Proselytizing Orthodox Pentecostal Trans Rabbit well that&#39;s your opinion. I don&#39;t agree with you obviously but I don&#39;t want to argue with you either. So bye.
Comment 66.5	@sudipto chakraborti  Nope. The thieves own Russia, and you&#39;ll never get rid of them =)
Comment67	Send him to the gulag!
Comment 67.1	well Russia doesn&#39;t operate gulags anymore. USA has CIA run prisons that fall outside US sovereignty although they are on US soil and prisoners aren&#39;t allowed any of the rights a citizen or visitor would have.
Comment68	Spys arent like jason bourne ffs😂😂😂😂
Comment69	He&#39;s a spy.
Comment 69.1	You Tube<br />&quot;I just don&#39;t know all the facts&quot;<br />Honestly? me too. I do NOT know all FACTS about this case. however, [I] know POSITIVELY that Russia would NOT target him out of hundred of thousands of Americans visit Russia yearly; MUST done some thing deemed dangerous to their security. led to him being arrested by Russian intelligence agents.<br /><br />&quot;But I will say that Russia is one of the safest countries on planet Earth.&quot;<br />True UNTIL you encounter religious communist or long-bearded person (clearest hence: Islam). These two... groups? of people ARE a threat to Americans AND to the rest of humanity.<br /><br />My friend: Peace and love. !!!
Comment 69.2	You Tube<br />&quot;There are not &quot;millions&quot; of US Citizens [..]&quot;<br />Okay. fair and just, I confess: it was an exaggerated spoken. <br /><br />&quot;to set him up&quot;<br />I do not agree. !! there was not a set up in this situation, I say. It was a spy case; collecting information on F.S.B. officers and agents. caught acting the crime. but who am I to say. let us wait to know the full story.. EVER ANY.
Comment 69.3	PrestigeGamer<br />&quot;How could you be so sure&quot;<br />Why out of MILLIONS of U.S citizens visit Russia yearly get this guy arrested well let me guess...... A f**king SPY ? maybe because HE WAS a f***ing spy ? end of the story
Comment 69.4	@Usuario Deyoutube Yeah what about it
Comment 69.5	PrestigeGamer because of this video
Comment70	If he&#39;s a spy I&#39;m Michael Jackson 😂😂😂 <br />SPYYYYY
Comment 70.1	If he&#39;s a spy you&#39;re a DONKEY 🤣
Comment 70.2	@Runcible2010 you&#39;re a hard-to-find Joker. Russia is one of the freest countries in the world.
Comment 70.3	A good spy will always make you think he isn&#39;t one. So you can&#39;t say he isn&#39;t.
Comment 70.4	@Runcible2010  i assume you are 9 years old, but you really shouldnt believe everything mummy and daddy tell you.
Comment 70.5	@Runcible2010 none of my friends and relatives escaped from Russia. But I know 1 American and 2 Germans who came to live in Russia. Russia is more secure than the US. Russia is a grand magnificent country.
