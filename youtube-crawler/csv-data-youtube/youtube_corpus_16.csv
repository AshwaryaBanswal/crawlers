Comment 14.1	It&#39;s Welsh. He&#39;s being invested as the Prince of <i>Wales.</i>
Comment15	I think Olivia Colman personally doesn&#39;t play the queen well in the clips I&#39;ve seen so far. Claire Foy played the role excellently and far better. Also the queen doesn&#39;t have rhoticism like Colman, it&#39;s a very bad casting choice I think. I think everyone would have much prefered they had just use some prosthesis to age Foy and Smith. I really hope Colman hasn&#39;t ruined the show completely.
Comment16	I hate celebrities, and I&#39;m gonna tear them all down.  It just so happens that I have a bunch of them that are crazy obsessed with me.  I&#39;m just playing around now, while they are given the opportunity to prove themselves to me, and if one wants to win, then she&#39;ll bring me dinner.  Otherwise, I&#39;m hoping to have a real  Lady furnished and adorned for me.  The Lady isn&#39;t a clown jester entertainer.  I&#39;m gonna rub it on their loser faces.

Comment18	Helena Bonham Carter played the queen mother in the kings speech and is now playing princess margaret in this series
Comment 18.1	She was great in the former, I don&#39;t really buy her as the later, though I am willing to be proved wrong
Comment 18.2	I&#39;m not at all excited about that.
Comment 18.3	She was crap in the Kings Speech and likely crap in this too.
Comment19	It took them two whole years premiere season 3. It better be good!
Comment 19.1	@Soufian 27 all i know is that if I&#39;m disappointed, I&#39;m gonna write a letter to the team informing them of my disapproval.
Comment 19.2	@Soufian 27 let&#39;s hope you&#39;re right
Comment 19.3	I believe they shot series 3 and 4 back to back, meaning the next season won‚Äôt come out before the end of 2020
Comment 19.4	I think they wanted us to get the old stars out of out sytem...
Comment20	The queen didn‚Äôt look like a Cyberman in her hat
Comment 20.1	Ceecee Booboo That was a hat?
