Comment6	love this video.. very informative
Comment7	couldnt catch u on chat :(
Comment8	Thank you Copper and Dutch! These experiments are exciting! And our Earth is always giving us surprises, isn&#39;t She? I have one of those plasma globe thingys. So, that&#39;s what our Earth has inside, basically...... WOW. This is a great time to be an earth sciences geek! The plasma ball was great to help visualize what&#39;s going on.✌😸
Comment9	You might be on to something there ie., the plasma / gravity ..
Comment10	Flat earthers crapping twinkies<br />Bwahahaha <br />I love it<br />But what a visual 😆😆😆
Comment11	Plasma can be molten or fixed in hot particles.<br />A solar minimum keeps heat inside a core. In 11 years the solar maximum will escape out into the atmospheric boundries of Earth and the solar boundries. ???
Comment12	Solar global minimum has not hit bottom on charts. Still a long way until all calms down.
Comment13	Good to hear you&#39;re now adding the beef to the soup, so much more than the energy travels. Lol Thank you Michael peace💓☀️🌏
Comment14	You&#39;re firing on all cylinders today! Scientists who are mad probably have become obsessive/compulsive. The elevator goes to the top here! Extraordinary insights, and brilliance! Thanks!
Comment15	Well now ... Looks like the force went through smoothly until Oklahoma.M2.3 Hawaii ... M2.3 Oklahoma ...Humm...
Comment16	You have a great understanding of the planet. I suggest a book and lecture tour! Einstein taught at Princeton, you should too! Thanks for going easy on the spinning and zooming today!
Comment17	One weird thing- besides my backyards level has dropped about 5 inches in the past few months-<br />I wasn&#39;t able to open my back gate today- it&#39;s on flat level ground, but I was unable to just unlatch the<br />gate like normal.  Now I have to really muscle it to open- so something shifted.

Comment 17.2	I was gonna ask same thing
Comment 17.3	What state are you in?
Comment18	Monte Carlo? Isn&#39;t that a favorite spot to sit down and play a very expense card game? They catch you counting cards, they&#39;ll throw you out.
Comment19	I&#39;m into it. I&#39;ll go and read the article on your Twitter. Thank you.
