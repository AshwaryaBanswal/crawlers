Comment 1.1	How the heck does the friggin‚Äô BBC publish a video with the interview in the left channel and the audio / b-roll in the right only.  Did we give the interview of one of the previous world leaders to an unpaid intern to piece together....?
Comment 1.2	Also don&#39;t forget to watch BrainwashingBC anti white propaganda all over UK TV and certainly don&#39;t miss our biased EU coverage and also don&#39;t forget to watch our covering up of pedophiles within the BrainwashingBC and establishment thank you
Comment 1.3	@parrotprodigy productions It has been said they&#39;re, a Greasy, Hook-Nosed Race Of Creatures, with oily black hair. Greedy¬†little monsters¬†that want to¬†grabble¬†up all the money. Allegedly the¬†Inventors of interest rates, and known to only hire their own kind, therefore taking all the jobs.
Comment 1.4	@Sterling Lee I haven&#39;t a clue what &quot;Grabblers&quot; are...
Comment 1.5	@parrotprodigy productions just here to show the other side. Veils are being lifted and the tricks and tools of the Grabblers are no longer effective.
Comment2	He&#39;s the unbecoming of USSR but, did a lot of good for the world
Comment3	He was one of the most sober and polite leaders that ever existed
Comment4	a man who cared more about the world than his party line... or even his own country. <br /><br />now we have trump and bojo the clown! sad
Comment5	Watching this video with headphones is a strange experience
Comment6	Banning anything doesnt work if one wants it bad enough. Gun are banned in China but they still have many shootings there, its just not reported by the State Run Media. Ban nukes, and Iran will just make them in secret. Ever heard of North Korea? I live in the Great USA, and would never support nuclear disarmament.
Comment7	Greta says we only have 12 more years left.
Comment8	thanks for destroying the balance of power..<br />Pffffffffffffffff<br />stupid..
Comment9	This guy sold his country out<br />He lives in exile in the U.K.<br />Geez I wonder how many dinner dates he has with thr Rothschilds
Comment10	Ah yes, when all else fails, roll out the nasty Russian card.  I think you‚Äôll find it us, the west,  that is causing the most misery in the world.  Russia are simply resisting.  <br /><br />More fear based nonsense.
Comment11	Guy seems worthy of a political position, the new breed make me sick
Comment12	He&#39;s wrong. The one thing preventing a third world war is indeed the fact that we have reached to nuclear weapons. No country would dare do such a thing. Everyone knows it would be the end
Comment13	Ya stupid ignorant blind greedy world to welcome evil china
Comment14	The traitor lives!
Comment15	BBC clickbait title.
Comment16	His mistake was giving too much freedom to USSR. He should&#39;ve took example from Spanish transition to democracy
Comment17	Wow
Comment18	Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev should have reintroduced capitalism but preserved a authoritarian system of government just like China
Comment19	Artificial intelligence is more dangerous than nuclear weapons, grandpa
Comment20	A Russian leader that Finally makes since! Put him back in office there or in the USüëçüèº
