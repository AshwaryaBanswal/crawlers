Comment9	Hi Everyone. I&#39;m trying to leave the western water&#39;s edge of northern Vancouver Island. B.C. Wild-fire population displacements have created Housing Shortages in an already difficult housing situation.  I have a bug-out bag but There&#39;s No Where To Run!!
Comment10	Thank you for reminding folks, Dutch. Yes, I remember the tsunami on the west coast. When the shelf dropped off of the Oregon coast. I live on the coast and I go to Moclips beach a few times a year. I saw where the wave came in because I drove up there to see. It came into Joe Creek. Also, I have in-laws that live on the Indian Rez. It also came into Taholah where the fish/razor clam/ crab process and sales buildings are. A lot of the tribe has moved to higher ground. The elders say they are going to stay below anyway. I became a sub in 2012. I appreciate your work and forecasts very much .May God be with you and yours. ( :
