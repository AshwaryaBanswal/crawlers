Comment1	i told everyone he was going to be impeached since 2017.
Comment 1.1	LIBERALS
Comment2	The BBC is the CNN of Britain. Both are fake news.
Comment3	The one and only reason the Democratic/Socialists party wants to Impeach president Trump is , they know that they can&#39;t beat him in the next coming elections. All the democratic candidates are misfits , with no clear plan that really benefits the USA and it&#39;s people. ¬†All of those who vote democrat should be ashamed of what their pathetic party has become. What once was a party that had their difrences with the Republicans , but the interest of the American people just the same , has become an extreme left-wing , intolerant of other parties , power hungry , corrupt organization.
Comment4	In other words;  —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –ê–º–µ—Ä–∏–∫—É –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–π —Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞! ;))
Comment5	If nothings wrong, why not comply with the proceedings? The inquest and committee proceedings are based on law--why is Trump breaking the law--it&#39;s not the wild west with him making up the laws as he goes.  Sadly, Pence will be worse.  I was around during Watergate--it all smells fishy.
Comment 5.1	D Stuart.....Definetely nothing&#39;s wrong with Trump , what&#39;s is wrong is with the Democratic/Socialist party , they want to impeach Trump because they know they don&#39;t have a chance at the next 2020 elections. ¬†Where&#39;s the &quot;Russian collusion&quot; ? The results came out from Muller himself , and stil they accuse him of this when in fact it was Hillary who bought that infamous dossier that started all of this in the first place.¬†I guess the &quot;law&quot; only applies to Trump and republicans , but not to Hillary and the Democrats , those are above the law.
Comment6	Wow. In Orwells book it was hate week. With you guys its been hate 3yrs. But if I know you, you&#39;ll make it h8 years.
Comment7	You would think youtube or google itself would be able to stop the spam in the comment section. I mean many have a similar profile pic, boiler plate spam remarks, etc. Especially on just a recap, it‚Äôs quite concerning...
Comment 7.1	Name calling and ridicule is what they like...  it shows how stupid we are.   The people they stop are those that state facts.
Comment8	BBC Proper gander fake news peddling the Deep State agenda &amp; the media lying bias scum are the enemy of the people.
Comment9	Republicans want an impeachment hearing to expose Adam Schitt&#39;s lies.
Comment 9.1	SR M.........Democrats want to impeach Trump because they know none of their pathetic , idiotic candidates is capable of beating him in the elections.
Comment10	Hey....Those polls are no more believable than the polls prior to the 2016 election. The results are what the poll takers want them to be. And we NOW have a social media that explains everything anyone wants to to know about this impeachment move....so voters DON&#39;T have to depend on the MSM and poll takers to decide how they&#39;re going to vote in the next election. The longer this Democratic impeachment move goes on.... the more the people who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 will be pushed to vote for him again in 2020. And who cares that a % of Republicans think he should be impeached. We ALL know the Republican politicians NEVER liked Trump...and many self described Republican voters never liked Trump. He has never been considered &quot;pristine&quot; enough in his &quot;conservative thought&quot;. So HOW did he get elected? He got elected by working class Democrats...especially in those forgotten, &quot;fly-over states&quot;, of Wisconsin...Michigan..Ohio and Pennsylvania. THOSE are the states that appreciate what Trump has done for them and could care less what the Democrats rant, rave and stamp their feet about...concerning what they call Trump&#39;s &quot;crimes&quot;. The &quot;popular vote&quot; does NOT determine who the next President will be. The electoral college votes decide that. And right now Trump holds and will likely continue to hold (no matter WHAT the Democrats try to do to him) those states that will give him a plurality of the electoral votes.
Comment11	When Trump had nothing to hide, they lied and stated he has something to hide over this Ukrainequidi pro quo issues .What a Lame talk,BBC.
Comment12	Democrats are scumbags
Comment13	I question the validity of these polls. If there is a loss in GOP support it is because the &quot;swamp&quot; in the GOP is realizing he isn&#39;t going away. And there are alot of butt sore GOP members losing their asses in China.
Comment14	Not a lot but the Biased BBC must keep up it&#39;s quota of anti Trump reports . Enemy of the People .
Comment15	You didn&#39;t say white house want house to vote before it cooperate. BBC is just another fake news.
Comment16	Wow. Lots of Russian Trolls on the BBC
Comment 16.1	you have a Russian prez in your little whitehouse?
Comment17	The same happened this week that has happened since President Trump got elected, NOTHING, he has not done anything wrong.
Comment18	There is no impeachment. More fake news from the BBC!
Comment19	"Here&#39;s what happened.<br />GOP vote UP 84% over last election in yesterday&#39;s Governors race. Bet the media will be very quiet about that.<br /><a href=""https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/9/gop-early-voting-up-in-louisiana-gubernatorial-ele/"">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/9/gop-early-voting-up-in-louisiana-gubernatorial-ele/</a>"
Comment20	YOU ARE A LIAR. CORRUPT DEMOCRATS WILL NEVER SUCCEED. MAY YAHUA BLKESS AND PROTECT DONALD TRUMP. AMEN.
Comment21	Are these poles done by polsters showing Hillary winning
Comment 21.1	Actually no, the VERY biased fox news network had their polls show 52% are in favor, and that speaks volumes considering the source!!!
Comment22	"IMPEACH THE SLIMEBALL LIAR ORANGE CHEETO DUMP!!!!!<br />IMPEACH THE SLIMEBALL LIAR ORANGE CHEETO DUMP!!!!!<br />IMPEACH THE SLIMEBALL LIAR ORANGE CHEETO DUMP!!!!!"
Comment23	everybody gangsta till the democrats start impeaching you
Comment24	LEAVE TRUMP ALONE
Comment25	how the fuck does any of this bullshit hep us as a country.....at the very least, it‚Äôs time to cut the government in half.<br />so much wasted tax money there we could replace all the streets in the entire country and feed the poor.<br />all they do is fight among themselves as if it‚Äôs a reality show.  this is our tax money being flushed down the toilet and they broadcast it like it‚Äôs important news.<br />it‚Äôs all shit. we need to take all their money away and put them in a trailer park to fight it out. what‚Äôs the difference anyway. they‚Äôre not helping us as the always claim they will but make things worse so the next donkey can claim to make things great again.....and so on.<br />i vote for a trailer park for former politicians.<br />and a new law that says they can never enter that line of work ever again.<br />children in a school yard get along better than they do.<br />how embarrassing it is for us as a nation in the eyes of the world.  no honor, no pride.
Comment26	This is a big waste of money for all I can not stand the corruption! The USA üá∫üá∏ can not afford this . This will cost millions of dollars üíµ . Drain the money dems . But it is my taxes that pays for your lies . Trump 2020
Comment27	?? What about epst1en and the rest of the pea dos? Why is the bbc trying to ignore the international pedo ring? Is it still all Jimmy savil round there??
Comment28	BBC is part of the deep state.  They were involved in the Russia collusion hoax. The U.K. are not friends of the U.S. they are fake friends crowing over the destruction  of the United States of America. It is a crass fake presentation.  The stats are false.  There is no way that Trump&#39;s supporters are being persuaded by these betrayal by Congress.  They have been trying to impeach the president even before the election. Hypocrite U.K. By the way, why did your security killed Scripal to benefit Ukraine&#39;s goal of compromising Russia? How much money does the Ukraine give the U.K elites?  Why did they beg Trump not to declassified the Russia Collusion hoax.
Comment 28.1	You guys are hilarious
Comment 28.2	@Doubler7 Hawkgt PBS? LOL
Comment 28.3	PBS  tool of deep state 100 percent
Comment 28.4	The Deep State?? Got any evidence of it even existing other than the lunatic ravings of a partisan right wing joker?

Comment30	The world needs to know this... <br /><br />Let&#39;s see... Democrat and Republican politicians have been unregulated criminals and openly criminalizing Americans and the world for at least the past 20 years.<br /><br />Trump ran on draining the swamp (getting rid of the criminals) and stopping war. The criminal politicians attacked him and &quot;the deplorable americans&quot;. We are god damn good and honest Americans and we want to stop these scumb bag who have been hurting people an starting wars on purpose.<br /><br />Trump won and took the corrupt Republicans out of office. So the criminals lable him unstable. Now he is investigating ONLY the CORRUPT Democrat politicians and they label him and Americans ulgy names again. He is investigating real evidence of crimes. Mean while they investigated him ILLEGALLY with no evidence of crimes, created fake documents, LIED ABOUT IT, AND DESTROYED EVIDENCE UNDER SUBPOENA. Then they say he is labels anyone criminal who runs against him... NO... He labels the damn criminals as such. These criminal politicians are people working to destroy the US for Soros and his group of elite rich communist psychopaths...<br /><br />We are trying to fix America people.... And yes, we will verbally assult these POS scumb bags who think it is their right to attack us and the world. We are sick of them pushing us and the world around.<br /><br />We don&#39;t hate the world or politicians.... We want freedom for everyone. We want wealth for everyone. But we won&#39;t loose our freedom to be fare... That is ignorant... We f-ing hate the criminal element in our governmen. Those who think controlling the world with a goal of Communism and taking all our freedom. Do you people dislike what our government has been doing? We do too, and we are trying to fix it. So choose to listen to the criminal element is controlling the US media propaganda, or look up facts and read documents for your self.<br /><br />US media is wrong and they have a agenda that everyone in the world should fear....
Comment31	FUCKEN MORONS
Comment32	Myanmar government killing Rohingya people . Myanmar government burning Rohingya houses. Myanmar government rape Rohingya women. Myanmar government genocide Rohingya people. Myanmar government play game with rahohigya. Myanmar telling lay.  I am a Rohingya. We went justice. We went back our citizens. We went back our rights. We went back our land. We not believe Myanmar government. Please help Rohingya. Please tell about Rohingya people.
Comment33	read ALL the transcript, texts, and facts and then make your educated decision. BBC did an awful job of playing down a very serious matter in this crappy news story. PS. Trump meets 9 out of 9 criteria for Narcisstic Personality Disorder in the DSM manual....he doesn&#39;t even know what he&#39;s doing is wrong because his brain can&#39;t fathom what its like to represent America instead of himself first.
Comment 33.1	Mr Trump is trying to do many of the same things that got JF K killed. If you think he is not aware of how dangerous it is exposing deep state corruption you are wrong. Thank goodness military stepped in and convinced Mr Trump to run
Comment34	There‚Äôs no way that 28% of Republicans are for an impeachment inquiry. This is another hoax. Just like the Russia probe.
Comment 34.1	yeah cause another poll said 92% of Republicans support Trump
Comment 34.2	Depends a lot on the precise question they asked. Some may be in favour of an inquiry to effectively clear his name.
Comment35	bbc animator on holiday so using paper cutting?
Comment36	This is UK‚Äôs fake news from what I‚Äôve heard..Yes you‚Äôre very biased towards Trump. The Brits will take care of the progressives turds very soon.
Comment37	The constitution says congress must vote, not Pelosi decides...this is a dangerous precedent to undo the vote of the people much like Brexit. What they can‚Äôt do democratically they will force...
Comment38	I wonder if the democrat know that they are doing treasonous act
Comment 38.1	marcwolfleach Yo, troll.  Have you read Article One of the US. Constitution? What is treasonous is for the Executive to ignore the House‚Äôs oversight powers. I know it‚Äôs hard for you to fathom while you are a slave to Putin. But we are not slaves you dog
Comment39	Bullshit Polls !
Comment40	Ummm...we&#39;re backing President Trump until our death. They&#39;ve been attempting to impeach him since BEFORE he was elected. We&#39;re not stupid. But we are battle-tested and prepared.
Comment 40.1	Bryochemical Intuition didn‚Äôt know you could get impeached when you‚Äôre not even the president holy shit who knew!!!!!
Comment41	DemonRATS are scared to bring impeachment up for a vote. Thats all you need to know üòÇ
Comment 41.1	That doesn‚Äôt mean the president isn‚Äôt a corrupt peice of shit
Comment 41.2	@R EE wait, let me get this straight. The Republicans that are for impeachment only hold that position to hopefully see Pelosi and Democrats hurt by a non impeachment? I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s just stupid and not politically expedient. For starters, Republicans know that challenging Trump publicly or privately WILL risk their bid at reelection, especially in strong red districts. So voting for impeachment while knowing it probably won&#39;t happen as a Republican is low IQ behavior if they care about their seats. Second, publicly showing other Republicans that you&#39;re defective is basically political suicide if you&#39;re tasks with working with senators that support him. I&#39;ll go ahead and use occam&#39;s razor here and assume that breaking from Trump is either a moral stance or there&#39;s a tide adjustment happening in DC. As for Pelosi, she&#39;s trying to lead Democrats to control the narrative - and according to the polls, it is working, as more moderates are beginning to side with Democrats in wanting to, at the very least, hold Trump accountable for his Ukraine conversation. Pelosi knows that the senate will most likely vote to not impeach, but it&#39;s all about the framing of their message and how they&#39;re viewed by the public. A milquetoast, apolitical moderate is suddenly galvanized by his reckless attitude and callous approach to the office. I&#39;ll just say that any Republican voting to impeach on grounds that it will hurt Pelosi more is just an idiot. If that were the case, we would have seen Trump&#39;s popularity soar through the roof after the Russia investigation. We did not see that. So what justification do you have assert that this go around will be different? Might I add that the evidence we have of Trump acting inappropriately with Ukraine far exceeds what was ever introduced in the Russia fiasco.
Comment 41.3	@G. Reid if Pelosi and shiffty are not scared of an open and fair impeachment , That ! is just dumb. it&#39;s 51% because there are republicans that want to see an impeachment trial happen because if they try and fail ..... that will hurt Pelosi , shiffty and the dem&#39;s for a very long time and we will have a republican president for a very long time and republicans wont be made to feel like second class Americans by the arrogent , self-superior , self-deluded , socially damaging fakenesss of the liftst / democrats. it&#39;s the snobs of the world (democrats) that has caused the us and them , republicans are the uneducated deplorables . thats the problem with arrogence , it makes you blind to your own faults............. edit..... Pelosi is not winning , maybe it&#39;s you that dosen&#39;t want to admit it......... but either way time will tell. ;)
Comment 41.4	If you really understand the reason(s) why they&#39;re wanting to impeach and tactics that follow thereafter, assuming they&#39;re scared is just dumb. Pelosi isn&#39;t a moron; she&#39;s fully aware the Senate will most likely vote not to impeach, however if public sentiment continues to shift around impeachment and removal (51% in favor by way of a Fox News poll), the public will view the senate as increasingly more responsible for the erosion of the rule of law and ethical standards regarding the office - quite damning for a party that lives and dies off the whole &quot;law and order&quot; thing. Moreover, there are defective Republicans that are causing a rift between them and Trump&#39;s &quot;us vs. them&quot; camp. Even more, moderates are polling in favor of impeachment now, that&#39;s why the amount of people for impeachment has continued to swell. All of this is political chess and Pelosi is winning, as much as Republicans don&#39;t want to admit that. Let&#39;s not even talk about the fact that this is all unfolding as we approach 2020.

Comment53	Give them bread and give them games and they will never question what we do to them.
Comment54	Communists and socialists got nothing better to do than try and impeach one of the greatest democratic presidents that ever lived.
Comment55	Adam Schiff went before the House and lied. he knowingly read a fake transcript and tried to pass it off as actual events.
Comment 55.1	@Sharon Joseph i read the transcript that was released shortly after and it sounded nothing like Adam Schiff&#39;s verson.
Comment 55.2	"@Sharon Joseph this is the full hearing and around mid way through he starts to read the &quot;transcript&quot;<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4CJ8MYLTY"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4CJ8MYLTY</a>"
Comment 55.3	no he didn&#39;t!  They all had the real transcript.  You really come across as pretty desperate with that ridiculous story!
Comment56	BBC News needs to look into US Law and the Impeachment process better.
Comment 56.1	@Thales of Malinda you are correct yet the BBC uses Impeachment rather than the correct terminology.
Comment 56.2	The house has sole power to impeach which first requires an inquiry to establish evidence to being to an official vote. This is not an impeachment yet it&#39;s an inquiry.
Comment 56.3	Indeed. Article 1 section 2 clause 5.
Comment57	Democrats lost the election, didn&#39;t accept democracy then went crazy and used every plot they could think of to remove a fairly elected president. The end.
Comment58	Bias Broadcasting Corporation is spreading FAKE NEWS AGAIN, the whistle blower is part of the swamp, Schiff lied on live tv, Trump asked the Ukraine President about &#39;crossfire and a server&#39; then asked about Biden&#39;s son Hunter and mention the fact that Biden got the Ukraine prosecutor fired and Biden brag about that on live tv.  President Trump&#39;s transcript it accurate he has witnesses and Ukraine President supports him.  Unlike the Democrats and MSM who do nothing but lie and the witness information is second/third hand and written by lawyers.  There is NO IMPEACHMENT yet so people do not have go before the Democrats and be interviewed behind closed door so they can make up MORE LIES.
Comment 58.1	It&#39;s a soap opera.
Comment59	Deep fake by the dems, trump is innocent and they will keep trying to falsely charge him
Comment60	BBC=British Bullshit Corporation. A mouthpiece of CIA.üëçüëç
Comment61	BBC, you are completely corrupt, and dishonest, in keeping salient facts and information from the public. What you haven&#39;t told everyone, is that this is NOT an &quot;official&quot; impeachment inquiry, it is an &quot;internal&quot; democrat only inquiry, because Schiff and Pelosi are afraid to go through the proper procedure, because this would allow the Trump administration to present their evidence to the public, and the Democrats want to keep everything behind closed doors. In other words this is a Kangaroo court. The other reason for republicans wanting a full impeachment inquiry too is because they&#39;re saying &quot;bring it on&quot;, let&#39;s have a proper &quot;official hearing&quot;, because they know that the evidence, witnesses, and sworn affidavits that Trumps lawyer has, is devastating to the Bidens and DNC. Why can&#39;t you just tell the truth instead of these constant lies?
Comment 61.1	@GinaPA222 I have to wonder about the mental state of people like you, because right and wrong, good and evil, don&#39;t mean anything to you anymore. You only care about the party agenda and retaining power at all costs. If you were a true, decent citizen you would be concerned that politicians of the highest office have been engaged in mass scale corruption for decades, and yet all you want to do is cover it up, and focus on a &quot;manufactured&quot; statement from a supposed &quot;whistleblower&quot; who has no identity, no credibility, and no evidence. Have you no morals, no ethics?
Comment 61.2	@The Watchman Hahaha...So it&#39;s &quot;like Trump says&quot;!!!! You drank so much Kool-Aid you have no mind of your own--just keep drinking and echo your master!!! I don&#39;t want to waste any more of my time on a zombie. Go peddle your altered state elsewhere.
Comment 61.3	@GinaPA222 Just cos you want to see it, don&#39;t make it so. When the house votes, then it&#39;s official, until then it&#39;s like Trump says. a &quot;damage limitation&quot; exercise run by the democrats for the Bidens.
Comment 61.4	@The Watchman You (and Trump) don&#39;t understand our government or Constitution. There IS an &quot;official inquiry&quot; and he can be impeached just for not complying. You are taking Trump&#39;s word that it&#39;s not official. Wake up! And there is NOTHING stopping him from publicly sharing his &quot;evidence&quot; at any time. We all want to see it!
Comment 61.5	@GinaPA222 Until such times as this becomes an &quot;official&quot; inquiry (whereby both sides vote on whether it merits an impeachment inquiry) there is no &quot;lawful&quot; obligation for Trump to submit anything. He &quot;wants&quot; a full public inquiry with full transparency. Surely you understand that? It&#39;s called &quot;due process&quot;
Comment62	Trump is innocent. The world is laughing at him that‚Äôs not fare at all.<br />He will find the justice soon.<br />God bless trump.
Comment63	Democrats hate the fact that Trump made our country better so they try to do ANYTHING to find something he did wrong. Guess what. They will find nothing. Actually HE SHOULD INVESTIGATE SOME OF THEM.

Comment 64.1	fotha Dan The only quid pro quo shown live on tv was Biden admitting to it, President Trump only asked about &#39;crossfire, the server and Hunter Biden&#39;.
Comment 64.2	What? lol.
Comment65	Do the BBC even bother to investigate anymore ? Do the BBC even know what Journalism is ?<br />President Trump is not being impeached. Impeachment requires a vote. President Trump has called the Democrats bluff and said impeach me. Democrats know they have nothing. All they can rely on is a Fake News Media to push their fake story ! Just as the BBC did with the Russian nonsense. <br />The Democrats whistle-blower phonecall story is dead in the water. The investigation into the Biden&#39;s Ukrainian fraud deals reopened February 2019. That&#39;s well before the Trump call. That&#39;s even before this President of Ukraine was even elected. <br />Is this just the usual pathetic BBC reporting or clear dishonesty.<br />Just a few names the Fake News BBC will not report on Deven Archer and Christopher Hinez.

Comment71	They call wolf over and over, right directly before elections they will come out with a big, terrible accusation that can not be proved right away, before elections to scare people from voting for him. Like what they did to Kavanaugh. I won&#39;t be one of those that is fooled by them. All the money they have spent to prove their non- existening wolf. Where is it?
Comment72	Wonderful news, nothing but the facts.
Comment 72.1	@David Epps your delivery betrays your statement.
Comment 72.2	@David Epps this isnt fake news this is literally as centrist as you can get at bbc or the hill everywhere else fox,cnn,msnbc,cbn,daily wire,vox are all fake news
Comment 72.3	This is for the people who have been brainwashed, but intelligent people know it is FAKE NEWS.
Comment73	What does it all mean for Donald Trump? It means that the Democrats are proving themselves to be hysterically compulsive in continuing their attack on our US president. It also means that they are absolutely not going to win the 2020 election. Instead of proclaiming to the US people how they would do things differently than the current administration, they continue to focus 100% of their energies trying to bring down the president, even before he was elected in to office. Adios Democrats!
Comment74	BBC this is disgusting. I expect more from a media house not in America. What do  you stand to gain?
Comment75	What kind of bias reporting is this, BBC? You are a disgrace. Selective reporting. Every comment from the president&#39;s side, you presented intentionally as weak. I&#39;m disappointed in BBC
Comment76	What happend this week. Absolutely nothing.
Comment 76.1	Guess thats a success then for deep state fake news dems
Comment 76.2	You better watch the news or read a dang newspaper. A LOT happened this week--and they weren&#39;t good for Trump.
Comment77	Lets be clear. BBC is owned and operated by the same entity aggressively pursuing one world government and Trump is NOT in an alliance as was Bush Sr., Jr., Clinton and Obama (which put in all those unGodly executive orders in place to transfer America into a one world government participant during the scheduled global financial collapse) Trump .....WILL NOT implement those ALL important executive orders and the entity pursuing one world government is trying as hard as possible to get Trump out of the office and replace his presidency with someone who IS in alliance.......like Hillary or the like. Vote Trump or have a total financial collapse...... period. Dont believe me...... you will.......keep what I state in mind. My knowledge is extensive.
Comment78	Trump will not be impeached, it&#39;s just another fake attack on a nationalist leader.
Comment79	Can‚Äôt beat him let‚Äôs try impeach him
Comment80	The republicans are only 24% of voting public down from 27% 2016. Dems are about 32%. All the rest are Independents 44%
Comment 80.1	TheDesert IsPatient what planet are you on?
Comment81	When caught violating the law T doubles down and commits more violations. He is running scared.
Comment 81.1	Can you name one crime and you can‚Äôt make America great again be one of them
Comment 81.2	Sharon Joseph There is no evidence that President Trump has broken any laws but there is enough evidence against non American Obama, Clintons the Democrats, some FBI, CIA etc. as people will see very soon.  It is all there available for any intelligent person to see.
Comment 81.3	@David Epps - dream on buttercup!  The orange con man is the worst criminal we have ever had in the white house, and is destroying america&#39;s good name every day!
Comment 81.4	Jeffrey Eick President is not violating any laws only the democrats otherwise they would have impeached years ago.
Comment82	Just like Russiagate this will be a big nothing burger. Which will only lead to more attempts to impeach Trump. Don&#39;t look at the polls they are irrelevant. Look at the record amounts Trump and the RNC are raising. Also don&#39;t mention Antifa attacking that rally in Minnesota, it doesn&#39;t fit the false narratives the media on both sides are projecting.
Comment83	You all forgot the betrayal of the Kurds in Syria at the behest of Putin for his good friend Erdogan.
Comment84	ignorant, illegal witchhunt. look losers. the guy Dt spoke already said there was no pressure like 100 times. but keep trying. shows how smart you are.
Comment85	The folks in congress seem to spend 1/2 their time attacking Trump and the other half fund-raising for their next campaign...   it seems obvious that they need no more than 6 months &quot;on the job&quot;, and they can spend the other 6 months doing whatever they want (without pay).    If only the U.S. had a means to call for a general election to clear out congress and start over with limited term seats (2 term max).

Comment 85.2	Sebastian Terrazas What a load of rubbish.
Comment 85.3	And the President spends his time and tax-payer money playing golf, you can&#39;t accuse Congress for their lack of work and ignore the President&#39;s.
Comment86	I don‚Äôt know what polls they are looking at because everyone we talk to is for Trump. We are tired of the investigations in impeachments. We wish the Government would just do their job and stop all of the nonsense.
Comment 86.1	&quot;I get my information by doing my own research. Everyone is braindead. &quot; <br /><br />* literally paraphrases everything Trump says. <br /><br />Whatever dude. I&#39;ll take my brain-dead over your enlightened any day of the week.
Comment 86.2	Jeffery Townsend There is no corruption by President Trump, look at the truth the facts and not what the MSM and the corrupt lying Democrats are feeding the braindead with their made up fairy tales for little children bedtime stories.  One corruption the corrupt lying Democrats did not do anything about is shown from a live tv programme and came from the mouth of the lying corrupt Joe Biden he committed quid pro quo by threatening the old Ukraine government they would not get $1 billion dollars if they did not sack the investigator who was looking into his son Hunter.
Comment 86.3	@David Epps Okay buddy. Why don&#39;t you explain the Biden corruption scandal for me?
Comment 86.4	GinaPA222 I do not use the fake MSM that work the establishment but use the web to read government literature and reports from independent reporters.

Comment101	Not one mention of Joe Biden, or his son? Or the fact that they were milking the Ukrainian gas company for $50K a month? Or the fact that Biden was boasting about getting the Ukrainian prosecutor fired at the Council on Foreign Relations? Wow!
Comment 101.1	@Letta Mego lol! You STILL believe the &quot;Russian conspiracy&quot; fairy tale created by Hillary herself?
Comment 101.2	It&#39;s a choice between the traitors that represent China vs the traitor that represent Russia.   Those that represent the American people are not allowed to be seen or hear.
Comment 101.3	The left wing media is ALREADY saying the Joe was just following an &quot;international mandate&quot; to remove that prosecutor....(and, get this)....replace him with someone MORE aggressive in pursuing corruption. Of course I&#39;m sure Creepy Joe would just JUMP at the chance to get a more aggressive prosecutor to prosecute his son&#39;s corrupt company....and possibly his SON....don&#39;t you think? The leftists ALWAYS come up with bizarre and nonsensical BS excuses, like this, to make the crimes committed by their Democrat politicians look legitimate. And the MORE they panic...the more BIZARRE there excuses become.
Comment 101.4	Cabronosidad BBC bias. The U.K. government have stated publicly they do not believe the BBC is biased in fact they go as far to say the sheer independence of the BBC sets an example to everyone else. LOL . Corruption is a strong word but corruption is corruption.  Very sad

Comment 103.2	Asa Coe.......Trump is trying to clean the Swamp , but the Swamp creatures have a lot of power , plus the support of the mainstream media which is their propaganda and lie machine.
Comment 103.3	Sorry Asa hole.. You would be 100% wrong
Comment 103.4	@Asa Coe care to explain?  All you have is childishly pathetic insults with nothing to back up what youre saying.
Comment104	The BBC is financed solely by the British Government  with money stolen under duress from the British public.
Comment 104.1	David Epps why did you bother responding.   The guys an idiot
Comment 104.2	2gointruth With Good News of The True Gospel What country are you talking about, the one where I am living or ENGLAND.
Comment 104.3	@David Epps <br />If you don&#39;t like this country, then go to where you belong. In the middle of a sea, looking for refuge and where people who are mean-spirited like you, won&#39;t give you refuge.
Comment 104.4	2gointruth With Good News of The True Gospel That is incorrect, if you want to watch an independent tv station you have to have a licence which is used mainly for the Bias Broadcasting Corporation, there is no choice.
Comment105	Trump 2020!
Comment 105.1	Aaron Stone Give it a few years and you will be grateful that President Trump had 8 years to rid the corrupt establishment.
Comment 105.2	I will not vote Democrat again. Trump 2020 all the way!
Comment 105.3	Anyone except trump 2020..
Comment 105.4	üåÇü§°üßØ
Comment106	It is amazing to me how you leave out the fact that the transcript of the phone call was released. That Adam Schit has been caught in numerous lies and met with the &quot;Democrat Blower&quot; prior to the story breaking. Also the blower worked with Biden in the past at a high level. Hmm, you forgot that Hunter Biden took huge amounts of money from a Ukraine company while knowing zero about financial investment. You also missed that Biden also took a large sum of money from that very same Ukraine Company, the same folks who shared interest in firing the prosecuter. The amazing thing is that there&#39;s damning video evidence of Biden and his collusion with the Ukraine government but apparently that doesn&#39;t exist in &quot;Democrat World&quot;. You also forgot that all Trump wants is a vote to legitimize the impeachment charges against him. The reason Adam Schit and speaker in name only, Nancy Pelosi, won&#39;t call for a vote is because contrary to your pole numbers, it wouldn&#39;t pass. Then there&#39;s the Senate which would surely vote against it. <br /><br />BBC you forgot a lot of things with this video. One thing though that you should remember is that Donald Trump is the President of the United States and will continue to be through till 2024. That is about the only truthful fact when it comes to those shifty, lying, Dems. Sound familiar.
Comment 106.1	yep, that bag of Shiff is spinning his wheels right alongside the other democrats who think they can best Trump on something.
Comment 106.2	Aaron stone yeah he‚Äôs unqualified that why us non Americans have been  trying to elect  trump like leaders
Comment 106.3	BBC don&#39;t do investigations.
Comment 106.4	@Aaron Stone Trump knows financing and would not fly crates of money into Iran in the middle of the night. Unexplained money kept disappearing during Obama&#39;s term. We needed a strong knowledge person to straighten out financing before we become a hell hole. Obama was spending so much in the east on wars and the Muslims hate us for interfering. They make up lies to make their people hate us. Then Obama brings them here. The cancer cell to start a civil war in the future of America.  I voted for Trump because he understand the danger of letting these people in our country. There was no other descent choice. Hillary is either Muslims or don&#39;t care about American. Most likely both. She would of very quickly created a hell hole out of America. I know I have not changed your mind but look up some Muslims Iman talking to Muslims people. Read the Koran. They teach their own people the Koran. When they talk to us, they lie about everything to sound peaceful. They are to be peaceful until they have a little power then all hell breaks loose.
Comment 106.5	I don&#39;t vote on polls, but I always vote at election.  I don&#39;t believe I am the only one. The polls I have seen want all your information, plus phone numbers. If they are  biased who knows what they do with you information and phone number.
Comment107	Total bull dust!
Comment108	Dream on.
Comment109	If someone said ‚Äúyou raped that woman‚Äù, but she says ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt raped‚Äù, that‚Äôs case closed.<br /><br />Ukraine President said ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt pressured‚Äù. Case closed, if we were using logic. Find something better to go after him, this is just weak.
Comment 109.1	Aaron Stone No pressure in President Trump&#39;s transcript.
Comment 109.2	eyekan spalwerds the laws are in favor of the politicians. They make the laws. It has to be spelled out specifically what is being given in exchange for something else. That‚Äôs why so many politicians get away with bribes.
Comment 109.3	@Tempe Snyder There will be no impeachment... only Democrats with egg on their face, or is it really excrement when 2020 comes around and they lose...again!
Comment 109.4	Well, just off the top of my head, the two guys that got arrested. All of the money that was being poured into trumps election from European sources. All of the people saying that they heard his phone call, that they‚Äôve heard him talking about and thinking about this Ukrainian plot ever since the beginning of the year. These are just a few, from someone who isn‚Äôt following it all that closely.
Comment 109.5	@Tempe Snyder <br /><br />What evidence? And is it really though? I thought they were investigating? I&#39;ll wait until something actually turns up and happens. Until then, seems like more nothing news.
Comment110	BBC is a liberal rag, totally FAKE news
Comment111	Meanwhile, another stabbing of peace has occurred in a Manchester shopping mall.
Comment112	Dems are solid good friends of China Communists. Keep it up ! Save China and fuck all Americans up
Comment113	Let&#39;s see...I&#39;m going to listen to BBC for information?    hahahahahahahahahahahahahah    NOT
Comment114	Did the BBC also make a video for adults?

Comment 114.2	LOL
Comment115	üòÇ
Comment116	Only 28% of republicans!!!!
Comment 116.1	that number will go up. they just require a little more time than the average human being
Comment117	Yawn!!! Another nothing burger.<br />Trump 2020
Comment118	Trump already started the war before the impeachment
Comment 118.1	Jose Dourado.......The war was started by the Democrat/Socialist since Trump got elected. They still can&#39;t believe Hillary Clinton lost.
Comment 118.2	Actually,  George Soros started this BS before the 2016 election, Hillary, and all the Dems are suck A$$ sheep stroking George Soros&#39;s Narcissist belief that he is a GOD
Comment119	The transcript of the conversation is in the public domain so this is BS. BBC fake news
Comment 119.1	@Without prejudice üëåüèº
Comment 119.2	Sorry that the facts are upsetting you. I&#39;m planning to move to the USA after Trump leaves office in 2024. I think the dems will be back in power after that election and they will be willing to give everything including a free house away to immigrants. I will be able to vote republican too when Trumps son is ready to stand for election
Comment 119.3	Love Trump?  Bet you love Tommy Robinson.. Why not piss off to the USA?
Comment120	Oh my crap ... What <b>GARBAGE PROPAGANDA</b> ‚ÄúNEWS‚Äù. BBC you‚Äôre pathetic. And guy, you‚Äôre no reporter.
Comment121	Democrats want Chinese domination of the world. That&#39;s why they can&#39;t stand Trump.
Comment122	It is not an official impeachment and it&#39;s just a charade. <br /><br />The requirements to impeach a president are found in Article II, Section IV of the Constitution. It states that the President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors<br />The impeachment process begins in the House of Representatives where the House Judiciary Committee decides whether or not to even proceed with impeachment. Provided they do, the CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE PROPOSES A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A FORMAL INQUIRY INTO THE ISSUE OF IMPEACHMENT.
Comment 122.1	@Stein-Erik Dahle Which part of quid pro quo don&#39;t you understand.
Comment 122.2	@Claire B&#39;Ahnana, Clinton was impeached basically for LYING about that blowjob.
Comment 122.3	@Ari Onassis-Sugen, you&#39;re funny! üòÑ
Comment 122.4	Didn&#39;t they try to impeach Clinton for getting a blow job? Just saying, bar is pretty low.
Comment 122.5	Trump himself has confirmed that he asked the leader of a foreign country to investigate Biden, a political opponent. This is beyond crazy and in itself enough to impeach him! And to make things worse, HE DID THE EXACT SAME THING LIVE  ON TV, asking China to investigate Biden! <br /><br />You are ok with this?

Comment 125.3	@Without prejudice - Sorry, gotta keep the suspense. All his dirty little secrets will come out at his impeachment trial and his criminal trials in New York after he&#39;s removed from office. Stay tuned.
Comment 125.4	Really? Tell us

Comment 129.5	"The whistleblower met wit his aides on the intelligence panel, not schiff. &quot;Lawyers for the whistleblower said that [claims of meetings with Schiff] wasn‚Äôt true, and that neither they nor the whistleblower ‚Äúhas ever met or spoken with Congressman Schiff about this matter.‚Äù<br /><a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/whistleblower-spoke-to-schiff-aides-before-filing-complaint"">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/whistleblower-spoke-to-schiff-aides-before-filing-complaint</a>"
Comment130	The Fox News poll on impeachment is bogus: The internals show the percentage of Democrat respondents is inflated and the percentage of Indie respondents is deflated. Dem respondents are at 48% in the poll when they are only 30-35% of the voters, and the Indie respondents in the poll was 12% when they make up 30-35%.
Comment131	This is all a distraction.
Comment132	The Democrats have scored a massive own goal here. They can&#39;t and won&#39;t, like BBC, CNN, etc, accept loosing the 2016 election. <br />Trump 2020
Comment 132.1	The 2016 polls said Hillary would win the electoral college and win almost every state. Both wrong.<br /><br />Now they are using polls to try and shape impeachment
Comment 132.2	I don&#39;t trust polls or think them accurate. You only have to look at the 2016 election and the Brexit polls to see how far out they where
Comment 132.3	The Fox News poll on impeachment is bogus: The internals show the percentage of Democrat respondents is inflated and the percentage of Indie respondents is deflated.

Comment 133.2	@DANNYBOY73 if you think those that voted leave are Trump supporters you really are clueless. Trump supporters are those who voted for Tommy Robinson. 5percentage.
Comment 133.3	@Gordon Pattison because making up numbers is easy.  60% of people believe 75% of what they&#39;re told without fact-checking 80% of it, half of the time.
