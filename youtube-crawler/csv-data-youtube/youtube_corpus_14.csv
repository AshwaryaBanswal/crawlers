Comment1	PiÃ±era The Dictator. The New Pinochet
Comment2	PiÃ±era is a poor soul!
Comment3	Stupid mr president ,
Comment4	So the government plans to raise pensions and minimum wage because they knew they were literally exploiting their own people with unfair incomes, maybe if they werenâ€™t so corrupt in the first place and actually RAISED WAGES AND PENSIONS when they could afford to and not when they were forced to, then I would actually believe him, he only cares about his people when heâ€™s leadership is on the line, seems very unethical and he should definitely step down and be replaced by someone who cares about their people
Comment5	Most tv stations in Chile are government funded.  Video after video show military people setting things on fire and provocateurs leading people to destroy public works.  What this president is saying is a new level of hypocrisy that only makes me want to puke.
Comment6	Heâ€™s hilarious and delusional.
Comment7	Stronge accent!!!
Comment8	You are disgusting, not fit to be called human.  You are a murderer.
Comment9	para que hablan en inglÃ©s en los comentarios si no hay ningÃºn gringo mirando el vÃ­deo jaja
Comment10	Such a biased journalist. The simple fact that she has seen a peaceful family being teargased has nothing to do with the fact that looting has to be stopped. Typical European bias against Latin Americans. Last time I remember, London police was not throwing flowers and teddy bears to rioters in Tottenham.
Comment11	What a biased journalist! Wow!
Comment12	BBC love chilean&#39;s dictators
Comment13	YES Listen!! The country wants you OUT!!!!
Comment14	You just have to see how aggressive he is with this lady when she says something negative about his actions. What&#39;s the bullshit he says about protecting human rights? That every person detained gets legal representation straight away ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ ..more like they get tortured, raped and killed.  He says he has been &quot;there &quot; just like the reporter...WTF? He has been seen in restaurants celebrating with his family while giving orders for the people to be killed. This guy needs to convince himself before he tries to convince the world. He doesn&#39;t want to acknowledge that Chileans want him out!!! He says a small group of people want these changes only...Is he blind? Does he not see the huge huge country protests??
Comment15	Great interview of president PiÃ±era, clear and solid. The journalist thinks that things in Chile are handle like in Venezuela or in a dictatorship. We are the very opposite of  what I just mention, we are a strong democracy and we respect the state of law. Everything that she asks is related with human rights and all that is guaranteed in Chile (the same president called all international institutions to come and investigate and everyone  who has been caught up has a trial as it should be). She only focuses into the few abuses of force agaisnt the extremist and violent people instead of the social movement (not to say that she does not put in account that so far 900 cops have been injured by the protesters ). In the rest of the interview she only tries to create controversy and  desinformation (at least she is learning at first hand that her own feelings and observations are not enough to generalized a situation in a foreign country ). People lacks rational analysis and they rapidly arrived  to wrong conclusion based on their feelings or background conditioning. Chile will stand up again as it did after the 2010 earthquake (8.8Mw), our resilience and will to overcome crisis make us stronger everytime.
Comment 15.1	Amen!
Comment16	He knows he&#39;s done.
Comment17	Bad president!!
Comment18	Criminal clown
Comment19	He is the president of Chile elected democratically the leftist have anything to obstruct his government. They invent and change the facts to their favour. He has been the victim of a strong communist movement never seen in Chile since the 70â€™s.
Comment20	The journalist must be blind. Hasnâ€™t she seen the violence in Chile? Hasnâ€™t she seen the riots? Hasnâ€™t she seen the mobs burning and looting? She should know that the Chilean people are much more afraid of the absence of the police force than its presence.
