Comment3	Omg! You are hillarious 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Comment4	Google &quot;How to put out a volcano&quot; - &quot;One of the established theories about the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa is that exactly this happened by natural accident; either the volcano&#39;s lowest vents became submerged, or faulting permitted an influx of water.&quot; Fracking injects water etc, into sides of volcanoes, are we to expect massive, multiple, long-quiet volcanoes to go off? Geez, and we thought mass shooters were the problem.
Comment5	Hahaha that&#39;s great man!!! Lmfao
Comment6	Dutch look at the USBS map of EQs starting 7/25-8/4. SLC, Utah into LV
Comment7	Either they are really mixing information up because they forgot their coffee, or their mental capacity is waning.
Comment8	Just &quot;saw&quot; a rather useless video from Japan--just over 1 min covering their large EQ--but all comments-GONE-and not translated.
Comment9	Dutch,  Hope when you gaze into your crystal ball things will be better for us all. Great work dude.😊🔮
Comment10	This presentation is laughable

Comment12	Much Love, from Sacramento, CA.
Comment13	The San Joaquin valley used to be ocean. I used to find petrified shark teeth along the Salinas river....
Comment 13.1	Wow isn&#39;t that just crazy. That had to been whole bunch of millions of years for it to become petified ? Wow that crazy weather conditions and high heats age it quicker?? Congrats to you for finding them awesome items.
Comment 13.2	If it too has not yet been scrubbed from the internet look up MUD FLOOD &amp; or Static in the Attic, CA used to be an island but then the innundation happened and &quot;the mud flood&quot; filled in the water between solid land and the island of CA. Old maps confirm this as does the terrain. Check it out we have been lied to for so long, few realize the truth &amp; most who could remember have left us now. Interesting times we are living in. God bless.
Comment14	Thanks Mrs. Copper, thanks Mr. Dutch!! 💕💜<br />Something is A-brewing, 6.6 4 days ago Vanuatu, just now today, 8-4-19, Big M6.3 Honshu and another M6.1 New Zealand! ! The Pacific plates doin the Rumba! Peace and love everyone!
Comment15	Water at the volcano. Anytime anything happens no matter what it is they say it is never a threat. It’s like a volcano erupting, earthquake going on in the background and they would say “nothing to see here, move along.” “ Its nothing, nothing at all just blah blah blah.”
Comment 15.1	Not what was said inn Hawaii.  I DID get a local weekly newsletter  from a community dealing with losing THEIR homes. Living with the threat day in day out. Lava flow through their property. Takes a bit of effort-but the news and info is out there.
Comment16	Hi guys
Comment17	❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤  Thank you so much for saving lives!<br />❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Comment18	Where’s the link to find your coffee ☕️
Comment19	What about Yellowstone?
Comment20	Oh, i forgot( been almost 40 years)  after Mount St. Helens blew, that summer was cooler -than normal and the gray -white ash covered eastern WA, a  farming area..our house and yard looked like someone dumped the fine fireplace ash all over our community.  Wonder how these volcanoes will affect these areas. It destroyed the first cutting of eastern wa. hay, and our garden was fine if we washed the ash off/ so Asian areas are plush, could it affect their crops/ roofs, etc like us...
