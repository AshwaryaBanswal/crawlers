Comment5	Democracy is dead and being replaced by United Nations traitors working <br />at a local level across our land and in all the other countries in the <br />world.<br />We won&#39;t get brexit because the globalist elite have decided we won&#39;t have it.<br />What you WILL have is forced &#39;smart cities&#39; and people being made to share or give up their cars.<br />Greening over our streets is up and running already in some city centres ( Sheffield for one example ) and they won&#39;t stop.<br />People can carry on believing the phoney left-right/Labour-Tory paradigm<br /> for as long as they want, but it won&#39;t make a jot of difference unless <br />people wake up to what is REALLY going on.
Comment6	Nigel Farage is the only brexit party to get us out of this fake boris deal NWO
Comment7	He didn&#39;t need to sign it, here in the EU we have television, we know exactly who&#39;s the piece of shit who&#39;s childish enough to pull a stunt like that.
Comment8	P.M. England please look my Situasion, pedro Marques da Costa
Comment9	bbc bullshit ALERT!
Comment10	What an embarrassment.......
Comment11	You know what they are terrified of leaving . And something else . This is all one giant conspiracy . It has been from day one . These clowns lead us right up to the day of leaving ,oh guess what another delay . It’s not meant to happen
Comment12	It’s honestly the biggest joke of all time this Brexit delay . What a bunch of total pricks . I bet they even delay going to the karzi ....cause they can’t make their mind up . We are being laughed at by the rest of the world. At least thatcher didn’t dither when she liberated the Falkland Islands . Imagine BorisJohnson and his mob being in power then . The falklands would have remained in the Argentine hands . I always said we will never leave .
Comment13	The UK  and the EU will forge very close alliance to the stability of the western alliance. We need to applaud  China for its ascendancy to capitalism and not aspiring to world&#39;s militaristic  hegemony . We need to honour universal quest for human right and how we treat  the earth for other generations to come.
Comment14	The only sensible thing to do is gold a 2nd public referendum  but this time without the misleading information and the lies, the simple fact is that in 2020 there is a a massive EU clampdown on tax evading companies and individuals...That is what Brexit is about, and don&#39;t let anyone tell you otherwise.
Comment15	Just imagine this.<br /><br />&gt;Time traveler goes into the future from the past<br />&gt;Time Traveler: &quot;Gee, I wonder what year it is... Hey! Have we left the EU yet?!&quot;<br />&gt;Random person: &quot;No not yet!&quot;<br />&gt;Time traveler: &quot;Well s**t I have no idea when I am then.&quot;

Comment18	Stay in the EU, grass is not greener somewhere across.
Comment19	Boris Johnson might be a freak, BUT he gets it to the Point.  Brexit on the 31st of October. If not...timeless and unendless discussions. In this situation hard Brexit is the best of all Solutions. You can prolongue till the 31st of January and nothing will be different
Comment20	This is a threat to George sorrows. The break up of the eu. Furthers the new world order demise.
Comment21	Kill all bbc employers
Comment22	Well done Boris. The Benn Surender Act is appalling. I can&#39;t believe Tony Benn&#39;s son is the reason why we&#39;re not leaving. Irony much. RIP Tony Benn - a great man.

Comment27	lmfao . clearly the politicians don&#39;t respect the peoples vote
Comment28	October 31st is Halloween! And he will sign Brexit then? That does not bode at all well for the future of a non-European Britain. Please, Boris, change the date, the omens are not all good.
Comment29	Hopefully the EU just kicks out the UK so we I don&#39;t have to have this on my feed anymore lol

Comment34	i hate borris jhonson
Comment35	I hate you what the hell I want to stop Brexit not create it your so annoying little rats
Comment36	I think the only way to sort this brexit crap out is a coin toss, best out of three, or maybe a game of conkers, it would suit the juveniles running the government.
Comment37	Britain has many outsiders who have made their nest and it is causing lots of trouble and this is the result.outsiders interest out vote natives
Comment38	We are back in the HOUSE OF REMOAN to CARRY ON REMOANING where everything &amp; anything gets voted down or blocked by the house of remainiacs with their sole purpose is to stop brexit and undermine democracy happening

Comment43	Johnson = Dictator and liar..also dangerous..he doesn&#39;t know the meaning of democracy.
Comment44	All part of The plan . Deliver bad pro globalist bills , get voted down , and then an election and referendum .
Comment45	How delusional on Johnson&#39;s part . He is voted down , and legislation stops him from crashing out without a deal voted on in parliament . Now he is saying he&#39;s still leaving next week , despite requesting an extension . Almost as delusional that Uk is going to be the best country in the world to live in , best weather , best roads , best schools , best wealth , best hospitals , and to lead the world in space exploration  . Last week&#39;s statements latter .

Comment47	There was no talk of a deal when I voted leave! I didn’t expect it to be easy in the short term but long term we will be fine. These idiots are driving me insane. I hope the EU doesn’t grant us an extension and I hope we get a clean break Brexit!
Comment48	When will they understand, this is not about what each political party wants or doesn&#39;t want, it&#39;s about what the 17.4 million voted for.  Their sense of self-importance, their over-inflated egos couple with their total disregard for the wishes of the majority has incensed the electorate.  This is no longer about Brexit, it&#39;s now all about democracy.  The people versus Parliament!
Comment49	I don&#39;t like the politics of Bo Jo but I feel a kind of reluctant admiration for his craftiness.
Comment50	Do any of these &quot;remain&quot; protesters actually have jobs?

Comment 55.5	thankyou for confirming the irrational fear of EU taking our sovereignty was just fake views and that it is brexit which is the biggest threat to UK sovereignty in hundreds of years.
Comment56	Caroline Flint represents the dying force of real Labour
Comment57	The BBC are so condescending when they talk about those who what a people&#39;s vote.
Comment58	&quot;A historic day for parliament&quot; Jeremy Corbyn, yes, but not as he means it, a historic day it is in the sense that it is a new major step towards its own extinction

Comment69	ordhuhhhhhhhhh
Comment70	on Saturday 90% of the protesters near the parliament are from Eastern Europe mostly polish
Comment71	Remainer MP&#39;s have once again made parliament a laughing stock with their behaviours scuppering Brexit .... We have had is 3 years of them throwing toys out of the pram ... Labour will never be forgiven for their lack of leadership and the liberals are just yellow undemocratic cowards
Comment72	Apparently this is not the first extension Boris has applied for....allegedly  the penis extension he had done in 2004 cost over £45k ....looks ridiculous on the  🏡 house,now nicknamed “Buckingham Phallus” ,<br /><br />..but says a lot about the man who would be king 🤴
Comment73	Remain block yet trying to figure out ways that UK can stay within. What happens if EU not extend as the parliament requested?  EU should end uncertainty and further push Johnson Deal ahead.
Comment74	Brexit takes a wreaking ball to our environmental and social standards? WTF are you talking about woman!! We had laws long before the fkin EU was founded and I&#39;m sure we can cope without it! See this is the problem, far left opponents that have no idea what they are talking about and acting like sheep because one of them mentioned something that will not happen. MAKE YOUR OWN MIND UP WITH FACTS, NOT LEFT WHISPERS!
Comment75	Paid online trolls pushing the immigration scare tactics sure got you to do exactly what the want. Russia must be laughing so hard.
Comment76	if they keep ignoring us bad things will happen
Comment77	Sadiq khan who is helping the pakistani community to create chaos in UK on kashmir is very shameful. Mr Boris Johnson, UK will suffer if pakistanis slowly starts riots and violence to curb their frustration

Comment79	Maybe it&#39;s time the BBC put someone who is for Brexit as a show host, instead of remoaning biased commentators
Comment80	CLASSIC!!!!<br />The Hous of Lords thinks its a funny joke!!<br />The Media say &quot;watch our for a civil war&quot; <br /><br />The entire Rebel remainers are brwaking Democratic law and are making May and Boris scapegoats like Snowball in Animal Farm<br /><br />There is ONLY 1 LAW<br /><br />LEAVE!!! BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE VOTED<br /><br />THIS IS VULGAR<br /><br />THIS IS A LABOUR GOVERNMENT TURNING PURELY FASCIST!!<br /><br />THIS IS FASCISM IN THE MAKING.<br /><br />THE PEOPLE VOTED BEFORE AND EVERYBODY IGNORED IGNORED THE PEOPLE.
Comment81	This whole thing would be funny if it were in any country that wasn&#39;t ours. I&#39;m so angry that we&#39;re even debating Brexit. Stay in the EU, it&#39;s obvious.
Comment82	This is so boring and predictable now.<br />Can&#39;t we just leave now instead of these constant delays, forcing me to listen and look at that Labour front bench longer.<br />The DUP will back the deal if it comes with a big hand shake.<br />Labour will back anything they think will stop the conservatives, even if it&#39;s the correct thing to do. They would get absolutely hammered in a general election.
Comment83	The voice of the female narrator sounds Irish, right? IMAO
Comment84	The PM might think he is above the low but the MPs who voted against the deal think that they are above the people, what an absolute joke!
Comment85	Subscribe My channal
Comment86	Remainer traitor scum.  Shame on you more like. 52% of the public will not accept this. We won we deserve our result.
Comment87	Staaaaaaaaaarp breeeeeeeexit
Comment88	Question.  Does anyone know what this deal is.  Name one mp that’s read and understood all 500 pages?  So none of them understand what they voting for or against then say to us brexiters we don’t know what we voted for. Oh the arrogance of it.
Comment89	Ashamed of those who seem to think this nation, that only a century ago had an empire to rule, this nation is now unable to stand on it&#39;s own. <br /><br />Corbyn, you are a c**t
Comment 89.1	@Zakk Zander your parents seem to have been c**ts too
Comment 89.2	Craig Bell with all due respect, the situation is very very different from a century ago, and an “little englander” empire mentality today is absolutely insane and impossible. By basic economics alone, the UK cannot stand on its own.
Comment90	Chinese people are watching this democracy joke.
Comment91	I never knew the UK was so indecisive. How many hours are they discussing about Brexit?? 🤷
Comment92	It doņt make sence, solid vote needed to be at least 2/3
Comment93	So Boris asked EU to help him dealing with UK parliament so he can get out on 31 . Is this a joke? He put Trump to shame on this one...
Comment94	Ahmmm, I do not think that the Scotland or Northern Ireland is very keen to see the consequences of the Brexit . So why doesn&#39;t England leave by itself ?

Comment 96.1	Take it to the people. Pass Brexit on Oct. 31st and immediately call an election on the issue. It&#39;s just common sense. Let the people decide which politicians should go and
Comment97	I think its time eu throws uk out
Comment98	Boris has died his hair in a ditch .....
Comment99	What kind of violence would it take to bring down the EU? Exactly what people and buildings would need to be knocked out?
Comment100	The irony is the dictatorship of the EU does get things done, if you ignore the people you can proceed, in other words fuck the people the leaders will decide, you count for nothing. Democracy is a smoke screen to make you think you have a voice that matters, it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s worth fuck all.
Comment101	Politicians like to make simple things ultra-complicated.<br />The people voted for Brexit. UK leaves the EU on Thurs 31 Oct 2019. End of story.<br />Deal or no deal is irrelevant.
Comment102	Who wants Brexit, really?  Not the people, obviously, because the Brexiters are desperately avoiding another referendum.  Putin?  Putin&#39;s puppet in the US? Big industries in the UK, who want more freedom to poison the British people, or whatever?<br />We know why Boris wants Brexit, even if it causes the UK to sink into the sea: because he has bet his future as a politician on becoming &quot;the strong man who thrust Brexit down the throat of Parliament&quot;.  But why should any other MP help him achieve that goal?
Comment 102.1	@Robertt Avro The (scant) majority of the Brits WANTED to get out in 2016, after the Two Clowns spent months telling them how wonderful it would be, carefully omitting all bad consequences and obstacles -- such as the GFA.  If even 4% of those who voted for Brexit on that occasion have now changed their mind, or just want to see a solution to those problems before the exit is consumed, then forcing Brexit now, with no such solution, would be totaly anti-democratic.  <br />Since you say that you still want Brexit, please explain what you want to happen to Northern Ireland.  Should there be a hard border between it and Ireand, or a hard border between it and the rest of the UK?  And should Scotland and Wales be forced to leave the EU against the will of their majority, just because the majority of the English wanted to leave?
Comment 102.2	@Jorge Stolfi Sorry, but I completely disagree with you. I believe the majority wants out of this union as per the national vote, and I certainly know I do. In my mind I want out of it first, then everything else can follow. It&#39;s like a bad marriage and divorce, yes it will be somewhat painful but needs to be ended. <br />Everything else is just stalling tactics.  If you really think people don&#39;t want Brexit then call a General Election with each politician clearly stating their Brexit platform (which are basically already known). A new parliament based on the issue at hand. But of course remainers don&#39;t want that because they will most likely lose. They just want to stall and stall and stall, throwing in more and more details to try and delay, extend, gum up the works so it can&#39;t get done, and they get their way. Regardless, I can see there is no further use debating with you, because nothing you can say will change my mind and you probably feel the same way. But for me, I want out.
Comment 102.3	@Robertt Avro Democracy is letting the people have a say.  The people have the right to change their mind about any subject; especially if their first decision was obtained through damn lies and sleazy marketing tricks.  &quot;Anti-democratic&quot; is a minority imposing its will on the majority.<br />Why not ask the people, &quot;are you willing to junk the GFA and put a customs border on either side of Nothern Ireland?&quot;  The previous referendum just forgot to tell people that they were voting on <b>that...</b>
Comment 102.4	@Jorge Stolfi Yeah....no thanks, by having another referendum we would be acting in an anti democratic manner since the decision has already been made by a clear majority of the electorate.  Stop trying to  overturn a democratically made decision of the whole voting populace. Why should we do that? Get it done first, then call an election. NO to yet more stalling tactics and NO to more EU control of England.  <br />We fought the largest war in human history to ensure there would be no German control of Europe and an independent Britain. And when citizens realized how controlling and dictatorial the EU was becoming we voted to get out. We want out of the damnable institution and we want it done now! Everything else is secondary to that key point.
Comment 102.5	@Robertt Avro The question is whether the public will know what Brexit means when they vote.  Boris wants the general election now because he hopes that people will still think that it means the bullshit that he and Nigel told them, and that Labour is to blame for its delay.  A new referendum on Brexit would have to come with a better explanation of what it means -- including how the North Ireland issue would be solved.  Boris does not want that, because he has no acceptable solution for that problem, and knows that there cannot be one.

Comment112	JC for PM!!
Comment113	What a child refusing to sign the letter.<br />Anyway, Boris has served his useful function in sending the letter.<br />Time for a vote of No Confidence and a general election.
Comment 113.1	Yes, let&#39;s just have a general election very soon and the people can decide one more time if they agree with Brexit or not.

Comment124	Britain in 2099: the PM has requested a delay for brexit again with the EU
Comment125	I see the remain freaks are so angry and disturbingly being visibly aggressive towards democracy! Attacking MPs whilst walking with their children is an act of child abuse Publicly aggressively invading A Childs space sickening as it is was allowed by police! <br /><br />Last year a Brexit supporter did the exact same to Anna he was arrested and charged by police for arrestment! Why is it one rule for one group and another rule for another? I say this we need to prepare ourselves for war and the war will be with Parliament and the laws in this land when I say war a war to protect democracy our freedoms and protect ourselves from oppression.
Comment 125.1	War is coming
Comment 125.2	Its time for the snow flake parliament, your grand kids will be paying so chill out.
Comment126	We now live in a dictatorship Britain. We voted to leave the EU 3 and a half years ago!! At least Boris is trying to protect democracy.<br />We did NOT vote for a deal. It was a simple in or out. Yes, try for a deal, but that is clearly not working out. Leave without a deal it has to be now. The EU might even get sick and just kick us out.
Comment127	The scale of incompetence in UK Politics is off the chart.
Comment128	When the Brexit can be done?......
Comment129	when the people start with pitchforks and tiki torches... i hope they start with the BBC
Comment130	My advise is to ban Brexit from your life. It makes people fall out with each other, and as has been demonstrated in the 2016 vote being ignored pretty much at this point, your opinion doesn&#39;t matter, so chill out.
Comment131	These so called &quot;polititions&quot; are not fit for purpose, neither is Berk-cow, they aren&#39;t doing the job they were nominated for, so they should all be fired immediately without their pensions.!
Comment132	Shut the fuck up and make weed legal
Comment133	Just leave pay nothing on WTO rules, clean break is a must .
Comment 133.1	@Fingers I own many houses, through being in the capitalist system, not nanny state, and this deal by Boris is just mays deal without the back stop. Means it will be years of debates, years the country does not have. A clean break now is a must. Although appreciated the get up and go of Boris, its a breath of fresh air, I hope he goes for the clean break now. The mess we are in has been caused by Labour, Lib Dems, and a few tory rebels, labour even want to sack the queen, they should be locked up in mental institutions, along with lib dems, greens and all other tatterdemalions
Comment 133.2	You sound like a guy who sales his house before buying a new one.
Comment134	It&#39;s D day we all know this, the arrangements the Royals have made for societies next step is happening and there&#39;s no point fighting it Boris, let Scotland free then make your deal, keep us out of whatever you&#39;re doing, we have a relationship with Saudi Arabia to get on with.
Comment135	Lol always good when Labor got crazy, not even reading the deal.. delusional Corban no law banning Boris to any correspondence, so no it&#39;s not circumventing the law, utter nonsense remoaners
Comment136	I mean, I hope we stay in the EU..

Comment139	time for the next PM lol
Comment140	Its time for the snow flake parliament, your grand kids will be paying so chill out.
Comment141	So I get an unsigned letter and I ignore it? Makes sense doesn’t it!
Comment142	He&#39;s opposed the amendment that would only delay it enough to get the ratification done. It is blatantly obvious he wants a no-deal so the hedge funds would suck up his buttocks.
Comment143	Legally he hasn&#39;t sent the letter. A copy of the act is not valid, much worse unsigned. His two letters are more valid than the copy paste of the act. Legally he is in default and will be sighted by the court. Even the speaker has the right to berate him over it. Boris won&#39;t be able to table his motion for a meaningful vote as he hasn&#39;t complied fully with parliament. Besides Boris is insolent and working to undermine his own parliament colluding with EU against British law.
Comment 143.1	Then allow him to call an election. Stop the stupid stalling and let him get on with it.
Comment144	Boris rocks
Comment145	Traitors
Comment146	Someone must be feeding Thresa May some coke, her speech is nothing like her PM speeches with sarcasm.
Comment147	Why do people waste their time doing this, the few powerful people will override the masses at the end.
Comment148	whether the deal is good or bad the opposition is a disgrace, they blocked the no-deal and now they block the vote on the deal. Day by day their plan on derailing the peoples vote is more clear.
Comment149	Johnsons beaten, he&#39;s bled to death. <br />Now, now move the old corbyn forward, then onto Brussels..

Comment163	Boris is proper Bo&#39; I tell the
Comment164	Brits would have their own continent if it was up to them since they don&#39;t consider themselves Europeans lol
Comment165	"I blame the MPs for not explaining the pros and cons of leaving the EU.Parliament is no longer democratic .They have a duty to explain processes and <a href=""http://policies.to/"">policies.to</a> their constituents.They act as little boys and girls and they should all resign  and go back to college to learn how to represent their constituents. The public did its work. They chose leave or remain as written in the statement of the Referendum."
Comment166	They can always risk brexit party  being voted in when we finally get an election.wont be forgotten. Get Shafted on so called peoples vote not going away if leave get cheated .<br />Cant wait for day corbyn standing at the election humiliated .considering london was remain city  serviced by half of europe on low wages houses packed out by exploiting landlords . not all about london .leadsom got great response outside london.
Comment167	Did you know that in Japan 68% of people do not believe Brexit is a live reality show? Apparently they believe it’s all actors! Fancy that
Comment168	Yes boris jhonson no deal eu out of uk on 31oct no deal no deal only 11 day eu out of London boris jhonson no deal
Comment169	What no one seems to mention is the MPs who have jumped ship and joined another party. It should automatically trigger a by-election. If it did they may not retain their position. Because what&#39;s happened is those that have left have reduced the Conservatives majority and increased other parties totals, which affects votes like the current amendment.
Comment170	Can wait for labour to be decimated in the next election.

Comment175	The longest ORRRDAAHHH I&#39;ve heard
Comment176	Big round of applause to all the british people writing comments on YouTube instead of protesting for having a real right of say on what is the future of their country - and don’t make any comments about how you voted 3 years ago- with a blind vote not knowing what this means<br />If you still stand for your vote then why not  confirm it based on this deal and just have this man thinking he’s some kind of martyr and hero at the same time , the ridiculousness of it all
Comment177	London isn&#39;t Britain, for the reat of us we want out.
Comment178	He&#39;s a posh Eton school boy who just wants his own way. He&#39;s looking after No.1 first and all his rich mates second, screwing the working man and the poorer of our society in the process. Like Trump, he dumps his allies, he cannot be trusted. He doesn&#39;t give a fuck about the likes of you and me. Anyone who goes along with his bullshit is as selfish as he is. CONservatives - it&#39;s all in the name. Wake up!
Comment179	Unfortunately the Brits starting soon to look dumber than the germ(an)s. Please finish the hick hack, let&#39;s fecking leave for good.
Comment180	These protests must be costing the bilderburgers a fortune in wages not to mention the flags and all other paraphernalia. They are getting so desperate they even have dog coats. But they are fast running out of fiat money and can no longer print any more because the printers have been confiscated.. So their beloved EU Superstate and globalist agenda is going down anyway. And forever may it RIP.

Comment 185.1	UQ 765 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comment 185.2	UQ 765 😅 not farfetched mate, based on what we are seeing
Comment186	The tory party want a situation where there are no environmental protections. Everybody in this country has suffered the blight of fly-tipping. This is what brexiteers voted for. They voted to allow business owners to pollute our rivers and seas. If business face the choice of making money and making the world a crap place to live in, they will choose the money every time.
Comment187	BBC always reporting with that condescending Remainiac slant...<br />Can’t wait for a government to take away their ridiculous license fee !<br />Make BBC a subscription model and see what the British public REALLY thinks about this tired old elitist organisation!

Comment196	Sad to see Parliament will not carry out the will of the people! There was a vote and the vote was to leave. In years past not fulfilling the will of the people would have been called TREASON!
Comment197	You can&#39;t say... Put it to the people&#39;s vote... Another referendum 🙄 They already did vote... To LEAVE ... STAY LOST <br />Best of 3... 5...7... So where does it end... by asking for a new vote will crumble the whole british government... = Riots on mass... noone will abide by any laws because they will be made void because another vote will create non democracy...
Comment198	This PM has given the leftie loons a nightmare to remember
Comment199	So Boris was forced to prevent a “no deal” Brexit by requesting a deal, now he has that deal but is forced to demand an extension? So they don’t actually want a deal, they just want to prevent Brexit from happening at all!
Comment 199.1	Conservatives voted against this deal.<br /><br />Some of them want a hard brexit and possibly war with Ireland.<br /><br />Its not black and white.

Comment212	The MPs don’t respect democracy, three quarters of parliament voted remain originally, there’s no chance we’re getting on with brexit anytime soon.

Comment220	A Brexit 6-part drama would be lit. A Game of Thrones-style show with multiple main characters and tonnes of backstabbing and behind closed door chats. Start it with Cameron&#39;s victory in 2015 and go from there. Maybe with some flashbacks to 1970s Britain haha

Comment222	Never seen so many loosers in 1 place
Comment223	Boris it’s time for ya to resign
Comment224	I feel that the bbc&#39;s commentary particularly Laura Kuensberg&#39;s is a little biased here with constant reference to delaying the brexit deal without any context for the oppositions reasoning. Is this appropriate commentary rather than reporting the facts?
Comment225	Just revoke article 50, what a waste of time
Comment226	This is so ridiculous. I cannot understand what the bloody hell is taking so long other than the rich don&#39;t want to stop being rich!!!!
Comment227	Following a referendum, the masses of Humpty Dumptys decided they should take a dangerous path over a mountain range where mystics said the grass was greener. After much deliberation, and despite detailed reconnaissance which had shown that landslides had swept away the path in many places, the Humptys refused to have another referendum, which was deemed undemocratic.<br />The journey was attempted, all had great falls and the queen’s men couldn’t put them back together again!
Comment228	It&#39;s a bad comedy, not so great when you can&#39;t  get it right.
Comment229	Can we PLEASE abolish parliament?!
Comment230	I don’t understand why parties supporting remaining are so inapt at selling their message. Haven’t they learned anything from Leave campaign’s win.<br /><br />Make it an easy to digest statement:<br /><br />“Back to Britain”<br /><br />Start whaling on the Conservatives and Brexit party and the like for having dragged the country into 3 years of inapt politics talking about brexit but not delivering a single thing. And particularly on having abandoned all other issues facing the British people. That by doing so they “Have left the British people in the cold”.<br /><br />Keep pounding on the fact that deal or no-deal it’s still years and decades of endless negotiations and infighting to come (paint that picture of despair).<br /><br />Then offer your great solution again:<br /><br />Back to Britain<br /><br />We’re going to focus on Britain again and solving its issues - not on the EU and creating more issues. We’re going to be talking about the British people, not the EU. We’re going to get all this madness over and done with. Back to Britain!

Comment237	The fake news BBC in action. The remoaner traitors are being outplayed. Boris sent three letters but they forgot to mention that. Stop funding the BBC. And respect the will of the people.
Comment238	Boris Johnson thwarted?  This has laid bare to all voters how much the remainer MPs have lied.  The deal met all the oppositions demands except remain.  So they have shown themselves to all be ardent remainers and nothing else.  That means that most voters now trust the conservatives far more than labour, lib Dems,  etc.  While SNP has shown how embarrassingly pathetic they are to the Scots by throwing a tantrum that Johnson did not give them the same deal as Northern Ireland.  That means that the next government is a majority conservative one.
Comment239	No surrender to the traitors in Parliament, bring on the GE. 👍 🇬🇧

Comment246	Against the Brexiteers.  Are The BBC and many of its programmes, As are most media outlets, The Judiciary , The SNP,  Nichola Sturgeon, the liberals, the greens, the labour party, some conservatives. The DUP,  Clyde cumre, add to that the speaker John Bercow,,,,,, all these groups are trying to stop a democratic election result which they are against, traitors to our precious democracy. if they succeed proberly through a second referendum all hell will let loose. remember this:  the brexiteers could afford to remain silent because they won the vote, steal that vote and you will wake a sleeping the lion

Comment249	I hate politicians
Comment250	Why just can&#39;t they pretent nothing is ever happenned and remain in the EU
Comment251	I know this comment may draw some negative response but I have 2 ask the question.....how is it so easily forgotten that the first referendum wasn&#39;t actually legally binding? Any1?
Comment252	Vote REMAIN in the 2020 referendum.........unless you are a low IQ, racist,  Sun reading bigot.
Comment253	What they want is to stay in the EU
Comment254	As required by law no as required by remainer mp  who don’t respect the vote. Time for a clear  out of-the lot of them
Comment255	"BREXIT DEAL - EU still controls UK&#39;s trade deals and has Primacy with EU law over more-or-less everything the UK wishes to do with trade et al, so what’s the point?<br /><br />The problem with BREXIT is that the people do not get the full facts from the media or from our politicians; whether that is due to ignorance I am not sure, but the people need to know the other side of the story or otherwise they too are politically ignorant. <br /><br />(1) For when you look into the text of the Brexit Treaty all other negotiated ‘free trade’ deals agreed from around the world gives the EU powers to stop any trade deal if it is disadvantageous and detrimental to the EU. Therefore we have not achieved ‘free trade’ deals at all in reality with this Treaty unless the EU allows them and where specifically the UK has no economic advantage over the EU. So I say make ready for challenge after challenge by the EU under this Treaty and where trade deal after trade deal will be totally open to prolongation and stopped if the EU sees that they are economically disadvantaged...and they will. <br /><br />(2) But added to this fact under the Treaty, primacy will be given to EU Law, tying all other trade agreements ultimately with the EU disadvantage mandate and which will be signed into EU law under the Treaty. Indeed, this fact was reinforced by the Rt Hon Ann Widdecombe the former Home Secretary on Friday 18 October 2019 when interviewed by Kirsty Wark on the BBC’s flagship political programme ‘Newsnight’. - <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0009dr7/newsnight-18102019"">https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0009dr7/newsnight-18102019</a><br /><br />And that is the crux of the whole matter, for whoever controls the law, controls everything<br /><br />Dr David Hill<br />CEO, World Innovation Foundation"
Comment 255.1	I agree with this absolutely (I am not a native speaker so I more than often miss the point) although I would like to point out that the british &quot;blame game&quot; is not helping them to solve this problem: <br />There is no rational reason why to say that their trade deal problem after they quit would be EUs fault or even a problem to EU, it is just the reality Britain should face it more sooner than later. <br /><br />It is almost like if the suicidal jumpers blame gravity for their demise.
Comment 255.2	@Janos The point is that there are no free trade deals in reality and the UK whatever is said or signed up too, is in the EU forever and all this independence is sheer hogwash or the ignorant.
Comment 255.3	You guys have the option to leave the table without a deal. Or you can negotiate for a better one if you prefer. But you have to face the reality: just as Britain cares exclusively about wellbeing of Britain, EU does the same.<br /><br />You can&#39;t have your cake and eat it. If you are out of EU you have to handle your trade deals without the power and rules of EU. If you accept the rules of EU you cannot do whatever you want. <br /><br />You have to clean up your own mess guys.
Comment256	Nationalists voted long ago to get out ... globalists demand to stay.  How much longer can the globalists hold out?  How much longer will they drag their feet, obstruct the democratic process, and deny the people their desire to be sovereign, independent, and free of Brussels&#39; rule?
Comment257	you see whats going on in Barcelona well its gona come here if they dont sort it out its gona kick off and london will get trashed then it will be a slum this is being dragged out longer and longer and the more this gose on the worse its gona get its clear they have no clear direction the peoples revolution is enebital use bitcoin the banks are going down there doors will close like in hongkong the end of the power above will collapse and come to its knees just you watch keep safe people oh and bbc has not hellped on the fake news and diss infomation good job bbc not
Comment258	Only a clown of his proportions could send a letter and forget to sign it. Who was it that said they could never back any deal that puts a border down the Irish Sea? Have a guess.
Comment259	I should like to make a comment on this very poor excuse for a man...OLIVER LETWIN....<br /><br />HE SHOULD BE MADE TO FACE A PUBLIC ENQUIRY.<br />With all his education and status,and apparent wealth he still has not one ounce of common sense, still can’t get his brown teeth fixed.<br />Still spouts crap,still defies the people that voted for him,I see that he intends to step down at the next general election,before he is deselected,still carries on drawing a substantial salary and expenses,he should be arrested for fraud and his knight hood rescinded,what on earth did he get knighted for?
Comment260	Your politics bore me! Your demeanour is that of a pouty child.<br /><br />Thanos <br /><br />This quote fits quite well for what’s going on in Parliament. They really do act like a bunch of children, it’s embarrassing!
Comment261	Well he sent a letter as requested by the surrender bill. Actually three letters were sent:<br /><br />- An unsigned letter asking for an extension.<br /><br />- A letter stating the unsigned letter was sent by Parliament, not the government.<br /><br />- A signed letter stating an extension was not wanted.<br /><br />I cannot wait for Halloween, the remoaners have been very undemocratic. Accept the result or move to your precious EU!
Comment262	The Remainers still a bunch of intolerant fascists.
Comment263	Poor PM &amp;))
Comment264	UNBELIEVABLE = Britain needs OUT urgently
Comment265	You put the uk in, uk out, in out in out you shake it all about
Comment266	Boris will do the right thing and get Great Britain out of the EU. At least he stands for principles, going against any delay which will make Britain a bigger circus then it already is. Whereas Corbyn and many like him are spineless and stand for nothing but themselves. Boris will make Britain a tech hub of the world with cutting edge innovation taking place here in the UK and exporting those ideas and products to the world. The Remainers should just back Boris now and respect democracy. And I find it treacherous how most of the Remainers walk around with the EU flag instead of showing the Union Jack. A complete lack of respect for Britain’s sovereignty.
Comment267	Labour aéré just there to delay and not find a solution
Comment268	Remoan stream media at its very best. British Bullsh** Corporation unrivaled around the flat earth.
Comment269	Why not cancel Brexit out right? They can totally do that and the EU woudn’t mind.
Comment 269.1	can&#39;t be done. A majority voted for Brexit so it must be carried out.

Comment271	Letwin is a quisling.
Comment272	UK Parliament is a disgrace.  Respect the referendum and leave.
Comment273	General Election Now . And a holiday for Laura Kuensberg and Emily Maitlis with their therapist
Comment274	Looking forward to a general election. As a former remainer I will now be voting No Deal and hopefully a clean break. Politicians from the big 3 have let us down.
Comment275	Good for Boris....
Comment276	Parliment and MPs are a total disgrace.
Comment277	I think this will run longer than the mouse trap.

Comment 283.1	How many paid actors and paid by whom?<br />How many rich middle class ponces from the home counties who are not affected by inner city immigration?<br />How many violent Marxist revolutionaries who want a bloody uprising?<br />I wonder who they all are, too.<br />The patience of the LEAVE voters has been admirable.<br />Maybe it will have to end if we are sold out?<br />If need be, so be it.
Comment284	Deals that only give concessions is not brexit.... He does not represent UK by keeping putting them forward.... Condicions of article 50 is leave and... The fraud created to prevent it is coming to light... UK on leaving will not change the trading system for years..... They fight to retain there own intrest not that of the UK... Article 50 is within law the default deal.... Been dined to keep UK tied and future government into a union
Comment285	No brexit we riot
Comment 285.1	It will be &#39;kill thy neighbour&#39; time, which will not be a nice sight.<br />Maybe that is what the elites want?<br />They would then be able to instigate martial law.<br />Operation Yellowhammer has been put into effect, though I don&#39;t think it is all to do with safeguarding food and medicines, more like the hammer to be used against anyone considered a troublemaker.

Comment289	The opposition is treasonous, we had a referendum. We want to leave. They are the ones “trying to circumvent the law”
Comment290	The EU Defence Union = the END of nation states....will the deal include commitment to the EU Defence Union....ask your MP..!
Comment291	Is an unsigned letter legally effective at all? I detest and despise this ultra-blown-up-ego-dung that does not serve us but nerves us. It just shows his state of honor. But we were good when we shoveled in the millions into the UK but this little Johnson-&quot;man&quot; can&#39;t even sign a letter. Shame!
Comment 291.1	I think it is just rude, because no need to be legally effective, you guys just &quot;asked&quot; the EU to grant a favor (enable a delay to prepare and figure out what do you want)
Comment292	I see Amber Rudd, chief flip-flopper is at it again. Hardly surprising when her brother is the millionaire Roland Rudd who funds the campaign for the people&#39;s vote (undemocratic losers&#39; vote)
Comment293	Go Boris, the people&#39;s champ!
Comment 293.1	@skill centre like we&#39;re interested in the opinion of some old fart who&#39;s a Republican army wannabe 😂😂😂

Comment 295.1	Ted Heath LIED to us back in 1973 when he tricked us into voting to join the EEC.
Comment296	Lol fuck these protesters shouting &quot;shame on you shame on you&quot; for what? Attempting to uphold the process of a democratic vote?... shame on you&#39;s for the not being able to handle losing, your whingy weeping and undemocratic views... absolute fuck tards
Comment297	British people underestimate themselves. It&#39;s a shame. This is because British people lost their self-esteem by immigration policy throughout history. Its time has come to Communist Chine not only buy the land of the UK, Europe but the soul of British people, Europeans. then a great globalism world will come with big money scandal, sex, disunity, and no spirituality.  And British people must know that  EU expects the UK&#39;s money and the EU is not a democratic community anymore but became the Evil Empire, which is no fair election to choose the president and chairman and no fair attitude ( no kind but proud)  toward poor nations in the whole of Europe.
Comment298	SURPRISE (not) Boris is another CONMAN...!
Comment299	Locate the ditch Bojo will die in please.  Need to set up a live streaming.
Comment 299.1	Buzz Lightyear College green just a stone throw from HoP, get that shouty bloke to distract police &amp; I’ll start digging a fresh one for Bozo<br /><br />BBC are always there, streaming handled, just the ditch to be dug
Comment300	It astonishes me how arrogant Boris is and how he sees his opponents. You would expect him to be humble to get what he wants but omg, he thinks he is more knowledgeable than all. What a mess he is in . This man takes himself to be above the law.
Comment301	Soap Opera of the Century
Comment302	What are these MPs expecting in the deal? Unicorns and rainbows? It’s either this deal or nothing. We’ll never leave the EU at this rate. I don’t necessarily like Brexit but for god sake just get it over and done with
Comment303	Bbc scum
Comment304	OMG sitting on a Saturday. Oh wow! Aren’t they good . Crap story and more BBC crap
Comment 304.1	everybody getting weekend compensation and double time off in lieu.
Comment305	Our devious PM’s at it again. Remainers masquerading as politicians to ruin our democracy and overturn the vote. I couldn’t respect parliament any less than I currently do.....these lot should be destroyed for many years to come at the ballot boxes to drill home that they work for the people, and not themselves!!
Comment306	Why don’t the bbc stop working for the remain camp you are supposed to be neutral
Comment 306.1	Operation STOPPAYINGYOURLICENCEFEE needs to happen ASAP.
Comment 306.2	They&#39;re all birds of a feather - vultures riding the gravy train.
Comment307	Well done Boris for sending a photocopied begging letter unsigned. I hope he used the original to wipe his backside with.
Comment308	Seems like BoJo the Bozo finally realized how hard it is to deal with Brexit. I bet Theresa May&#39;s glad not to have to deal with this shit anymore.
Comment309	I don&#39;t think the EU will allow an extension give there are mep&#39;s who are not happy with how the EU is stopping the UK from having it&#39;s sovereignty. The EU dogs are finished
Comment310	English get what they want everyone else in this so called union can off
Comment311	Remainer MPs will never allow Brexit to happen. The Letwin Act blocked a meaningful vote on the PM’s deal that would have finally brought an end to the UK’s Brexit journey.  The Benn Act forces the government to seek Brexit deadline extension in event of no deal, was drawn up in expectation of NO DEAL. But Mr Johnson produced a deal.Hence scramble to come up with Letwin amendment, which forces extension even with deal. Not sure this country has ever been more betrayed by its parliament, while blocking a General Election so the people can&#39;t do anything about it. These MPs don’t want to allow voters to leave and want to make sure there is NO mandate from the public to decide where they want their country to go in a General Election for fear they would lose.<br />Bet they will still blame Boris Johnson though. This Hilary is playing to the Remoaner crowd. If Brexit is not delivered, we no longer have a democracy, we officially become a banana republic where it&#39;s a free for all, rules and laws will no longer count.
Comment312	is it time to storm the house yet?
Comment313	&quot; The end days  off the  Labour party  soon&quot;
Comment314	English bourgeois woman always had a problem.  For these people, to be civilized means to continue life as a child in submission to authorities.  The woman emasculate and scold the men within their households while submitting to a fragmented authorities from the outside, all in some disorderly manner.  It&#39;s really an adult educated to be a child, now enforcing the code of a child.  The lower bourgeois men also do it, punishing and correcting, ignoring serious adult problems, no one becomes an adult.  The lower bourgeois classes remain as snarky children.  I had to live through this nightmare while being held captive.  I have to watch other people be treated as adults by adults, while poor grown children are preached to about the responsibilities of being a child for life.
Comment315	Whenever we see images of remainer protests it always looks like a scene from “one flew over the cuckoo&#39;s nest”
Comment316	More cowardly and undeomcratic delay from Corbyn &amp; Co. Should&#39;ve guessed it wouldn&#39;t be the season finale!
Comment317	Fuck of the whole lot of yer.
Comment318	I like all these remain fagg comments. But reality will soon hit you hard!
Comment319	We all know why Boris is pushing for a no deal ££££££ at the expense of the average joe.  Boris is a liar and cheat who is only interested in financial gain. Parasite.
Comment320	Is this ridicule chaotic political Brexit &quot;farting circus&quot; in the House of Commons going to continue forever, a production season after a production season? Her Majesty´s Prime Minister Boris Johnson´s Brexit deal with the EU is only a little improved version of the Theresa May´s Brexit deal and it´s a temporary deal that that gives time to negotiate a long term deal without trade disturbances etc. Are those modern Chevaliers and Roundheads in Westminster planning to start a new civil war in the UK?
Comment321	Is the job of parliament to increase the fuckerage?
Comment322	The never ending story. Let&#39;s get it done once and for all.
Comment323	Yes most of them Marxist uni students
Comment 323.1	Melvin Ishtar well ur that uneducated in history that u support an ideology that killed millions. Also how dare u come to this country and try and spread such poison. Go and fight for socialism in ur own country.
Comment 323.2	We marxists fucked your mother ! ;)
Comment324	Mr McDonnell says Parliament made a decision, he should abide by it. Really? Parliament isn&#39;t abiding by the decision of 17.4 million voters though is it? The MPs are acting like spoilt brats who want what they want and to hell with the voters. Pot calling kettle here I think.
Comment325	The UK Government voted overwhelmingly for a EU referendum in 2015 and the people voted overwhelmingly to leave: 52%-48% which added up to: 1.3million majority out of around a 72% turnout... And now the overwhelmingly remainer parliament have had their real agenda&#39;s exposed. They want to countermand the democratic will of the people... It&#39;s got nothing to do with leaving without a deal, or crashing out, because a deal was put before them yesterday that was agreed by the EU and would have honoured the referendum result.  Those MPs that voted for the Letwin amendment, which has torpedoed below the waterline any idea of a BREXIT deal that honours the referendum, are dishonourable anti-democratic and enemies of democracy.
Comment326	The eyes have it ? But all we’ve seen is bollocks and bullshit
Comment327	Leave with no deal I don’t trust this deal as we have not read it. <br />Also that’s what we voted for!
Comment 327.1	kim warburton and it never said leave with a deal or remain did it? So everyone was led to believe that it was either leave or remain. No deal was mentioned. So ur full of shit and an absolute disgrace to go against democracy. The lot of u r traitors in my eyes. Sack every mp who has said they want to stop brexit. I bet ur from London’s or a city too? And watch bbc news daily u bloody sheep
Comment 327.2	kim warburton omg ur trying to tell people what they voted for u fascist. Just listen instead of acting like a child. It was leave or remain, not leave with a deal but just leave now bore off u ffffin Marxist
Comment 327.3	@Paul Dunne 1 im 40<br />2 im an anarchist<br />3 i remember what i saw on the voting ballot, even if u dont
Comment 327.4	kim warburton yes we did because all u remainers would not shut up saying we would have to be in the single market and so on. We were all prepared to leave and u all said it would be an economic disaster and the scaremongering was based on what would happen should we have just left. Ur all full of sh#* I bet ur a uni student , socialist / Marxist sheep. Well guess what ur ideology is not wanted by the majority. We see through ur use of media to sway people thought and the way u attack people and try and stop them having a point of view u fascists. Also who are u to tell me why I voted? I know exactly why I voted and that’s for independence and we won’t have that with any deal. Now suck it up buttercup coz ur on the wrong side of history u Marxist.
Comment 327.5	No u didnt<br />U voted to leave<br />U didnt vote for HOW to leave<br />U didnt vote for a no deal. Those wernt in the options. So to claim u voted no deal all along n that everyone else all 17.whateva millions who voted leave were voting no deal is a blatent lie
Comment328	UK doing lot of mischief around the world, what goes around comes around, thousands of businesses gone bust, northern cities gone poorer, depression in millions, knife crime...
Comment329	Disrespectful and may i say churlish to all...apologise from the UK people...CONS out...and i am not political or wasn&#39;t...watched 6 hours for THIS embarasine outcome....
Comment330	Around 100 years later: boris might have a deal
Comment331	They are laughing at us. They should not be allowed to run our country any more.
Comment332	That&#39;s what happens when public sector militant elitists go straight to a sympathetic court, Dobbin&#39;s arse comes out and it&#39;s covered with blueberry jam.  &#39;Lick that blueberry jam&#39; it says while a buck toothed, fat barrister cringes on his wee willy willy.  Then both legs up and whipes it off on the floor, a good result for reason and a reminder about how nepotism creates an intellectual mire.

Comment334	Fuck you boris and mogg.....you to nigel <br />It&#39;s not about not wanting brexit<br />It&#39;s about the brexit that profits you and your hundred or so wealthy friends/destroys unions and fucks over the people  and industries<br />Vs<br />A brexit that takes care of the people, jobs and provides a good life for the many not the wealthy, well connected few.
Comment335	One foot in and one foot out deal !! Certainly got what they want not what the people want EU still control us after a deal, just with less confrontation
Comment336	Making up laws to protect there own desires. Just another example of their self serving attitude.
Comment337	Can’t believe he actually died in a ditch.
Comment338	BRITAIN asks for more time to sabotage the European security.
Comment339	Well still, well hopefully leave on the 31st so those remoaners cheers will end very abruptly oh dear 😆
Comment340	Order. ORDER. OOOOORDAAAAAHHHHHH
Comment341	I bet they won’t. Would you grant an extension so you could spend longer at the same impasses you’ve already spent 3 years at without a satisfactory conclusion? At this point it’s plain to all that there are those who want to leave under any circumstances and those who will stop at nothing to remain. There’s no hint of more time resulting in a more favorable resolution. They won’t grant more time in hopes the opposition will successfully overthrow the government and overturn the referendum result. Why would they wait around to be accused of conspiracy and get blamed by all for every negative consequence of a plan that may not even yield results??? They’re being used in a bid for power, and they probably don’t appreciate the abuse.
Comment342	"Only fools who dont know what brexit means want it.Those idiots been brainwashed by the <a href=""http://rich.rich/"">rich.Rich</a> people only benefits from it.and those poor idiots will suffer, more expensive food,cut benefits, no medicine,"

Comment346	We voted brexit so let us out already
Comment347	Get these treasonous elitist corrupt morons out.....
Comment348	The E.U. has no interest in a &quot;no deal&quot; Brexit. So they will grand extension after extension. First, because it&#39;s fatal for many U.K. and E.U citizens and second, it will not allow any U.K extremists to blame the E.U. for their mess this time.
Comment349	I suppose he thinks he&#39;s very smart, when in fact he&#39;s just being puerile. The UK PM is acting like a petulant school boy.
Comment350	Corbyn is the most dangerous man in the UK he needs stopping
Comment351	You dirty dirty smear merchants.  Get bent.   Oh and while I&#39;m here neoliberals sold Britain&#39;s future to European conglomerates and international banks just like the met sold the girls in the north to the predator class and radical clerics.  Get bent.  fishmongers writing filthy copy not fit as a fish wrapper.  Evil.
Comment352	The people have the right for a second referendum !<br />      We can change our mind it s been 3 years since the referendum !<br />     We have the right to demand another vote ! I understand that the brexiteers don t want one , but this time we have the majority ! So get used with it .

Comment357	What in the God damn hell is happening
Comment 357.1	I think we&#39;re on season 4 of &quot;Brexit: The Happening&quot; at the minute. Far more interesting than Game of Thrones.
Comment358	me think:<br />Bojo gave concessions to get the deal, at a condition:  EU won&#39;t grant xtension if asked.<br />Bojo is right to not sign the letter:  anything signed under duress is VOID.
Comment359	I&#39;ve come to notice that whenever there are protests from both sides behind the BBC presenters  - they will only view/ film the anti democratic  anti Brexit protesters  in the back ground with their EU flags.
Comment360	Bojo sent to the EU a copy of the Act, an unsigned letter and a signed letter stating he doesn&#39;t want an extension of time. So, for EU, there is nothing there to consider. You are heading straight to a no deal exit.
Comment361	Selfish,that’s the only word for British people,extremely selfish.
Comment 361.1	"GBOY69GAY I’m watching it in very happy mood,UK has big fire in their own country while they are still settling fire in <a href=""http://hongkong.is/"">Hongkong.Is</a> British people smart or stupid?"
Comment 361.2	Hot Chen; What did you expect? Britons are descendants of greedy and unscrupulous pirates and thieves, who had once great ambitions, wild imagination and romantic dreams. They began to pretend during the 19th century when their rising global Pirate Empire became wealthy and powerful that they are civilized, but the Empire collapsed soon after the from the UK´s point of view Pyrrhic WWII &quot;victory&quot; and is today a fading memory, a civilization gone with the wind.
Comment 361.3	I agree, Remainers are selfish.
Comment362	EU needs to inform the MPs in Parlement that EU law supersedes the Ben Act. The Ben Act is infact illegal.  According to the law article 50 states by law that the PM must not threatened, bullied, or to be told go in a Direction against his will.
Comment 362.1	@kim warburton Did you not read what I said? EU law supersedes the Ben Act. I aid nothing about how was sovereign!
Comment 362.2	Lol the pm is not sovereign, parliament is<br />U shlda learnt that about 5 weeks ago over the prorogation
Comment363	CAN YOU BRISTISH FINALLY FUCK OFF AND ROT AWAY, THANK YOU !!!!!<br />WE DON&#39;T NEED YOU IN EUROPE.
Comment364	<b>The 130,000 DEAD caused by Tory austerity (which Boris Johnson shares responsibility for) SHOULD HAVE JUSTICE..!!</b><br />Murderer of 130,000 by deliberate austerity policy and now <b>BORIS IS A BREXIT TRAITOR, TOO..!!</b><br />His efforts to defy the will of Parliament and the people are <b>UTTERLY CRIMINAL..!!</b><br /><br /><b>Confiscate all personal profits, shares and proceeds from these CON-(artist)- SERVATIVE TRAITORS, who are all STILL planning to PROFIT PERSONALLY by this ACT OF ELITIST TREACHERY..!!</b><br />Pay <b>ALL</b> monies to the 130,000 dead victims&#39; families <b>UNTIL THESE DISGUSTING TORY TRAITORS ARE LEFT WITH NOTHING..!!</b><br />Then we should pursue <b>JUSTICE FOR THE DEAD THEMSELVES..!!</b>
Comment365	the loophole:<br />send a photocopy unsigned, and a letter signed asking EU to ignore the photocopy !!!<br />then put little ber-COW in a can, and keep kicking the can down the road till Halloween.<br />well done, Bojo !!
Comment366	And therewith started the blamegame. If the EU accepts the unsigned request, it will be blamed by the torries and it will be used for political gain. If the EU doesn’t accept the request, it will be blamed for a no deal Brexit. UK, please sort out your own shit and leave us (EU) out for once.
Comment367	an unsigned letter? of course nobody trusts this person
Comment 367.1	John Doe If I say I&#39;m going to get drunk and drive down a motorway at 100mph, then get caught doing it, does that make me a trustworthy person too?
Comment 367.2	@John Doe why? because he&#39;s trying again and again to bypass the law. who is he actually representing? certainly not majority of the country. and the suggestion for a general election did not gain a majority at the time, and that&#39;s that. we live in a democracy, so if a people&#39;s vote (when a deal is agreed upon) is considered the only way forward so be it.
Comment 367.3	why? he has done exactly what he said he would do. He has sent the letter in compliance with the law &amp; made the will of parliament known. he has then sent another letter letting them know the position of the ruling party. He should not have been put in this position in the first place, it should have gone to a general election after which the will of the people would have been reaffirmed and we could have proceeded from there.
Comment368	Someone needs to investigate these corrupt politicians that are going against to will of the people who voted leave. They are probably getting kickbacks not to let you leave.
Comment369	Guy Fawkes was right.
Comment370	This corrupted network along with the traitors of Westminster it so rejoices in will be scrubbed! We the majority of British stock have witnessed alongside blairite appointees the destruction of a organisation and a parliament that was the voice of the people. Good riddance both and suffer the mediocrity, disgust and scorn you rightly deserve
Comment371	Morons supporting your narrative; shouldn&#39;t you respect The Peoples&#39; Decision and bloody LEAVE!!!
Comment372	The benn act is an absolute joke
Comment 372.1	I,&#39;m luaghing happy days
Comment373	We never voted to be so entrenched the EU.
Comment 373.1	Yes we did, multiple  times over multiple governments.<br /><br />Its called representative democracy, look it up.
Comment374	What an absolute mess. I miss the UK so much but am glad I left 😢
Comment 374.1	I&#39;m glad you left too.
Comment375	The  British are stupid;   get out of EU and ;you  will prosper
Comment376	Another 3 years of waste of taxpayers money
Comment377	BERCOW IS AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE TO THE DEMOCRACY BY BEING ILLEGALLY BIASED...HE MUST GO DOWN NOW....

Comment379	These remoaners don&#39;t represent the majority. Look at the polls BBC.
Comment380	A look into the future: June 23. 2036 Breaking News: 20th Anniversary of Brexit referendum... Tim Barrow (75): new request for a three-month delay to Brexit...<br />OMG The never-ending story cames true... A Brexit with no exit.... 🤣
Comment381	No Deal Brexit only.The sun never sets on the british empire.... and now a you people are slaves a few decades later??? How did that happen...your Politicians &quot;Sold You Out&quot;... they demand your Slavery!!! No Civil War...instead ...No Deal Brexit.   Flush the EU...Flush your Politicians...take back your Freedom and Thrive!!!
Comment382	Damned House of Commons doesn&#39;t represent the people
Comment 382.1	@fidel castro You mean by opposing the people&#39;s decision. Yes, congratulations to them on that. Very well done.
Comment 382.2	@fidel castro You seem to have misunderstood my comment. Of course the Commons are supposed to represent the people, they are definitely the ones who are responsible for doing that job. I&#39;m saying that they are currently failing at that.
Comment383	EU Flag waving traitors
Comment384	No deal it is then 👍🏻
Comment385	Never before has a TV company arranged interviews where they can be constantly interrupted by public shouting. Studios are soundproofed for obvious reasons.<br />More ludicrous BBC propaganda I&#39;d say.
Comment386	God this is ridiculous. People bloody voted to leave. How can the MP’s keep ignoring that fact. British politics have been dominated by this matter, at this rate we’ll be leaving longer then we were officially in.
Comment387	This pathetic, execrable, dismal, shameful, repugnant, surreal, ridiculous, tiresome, pitiful farce continues.... In other news the Earth is flat and socks disappear in washing machines.
Comment388	The BBC, Bercow Corbyn and a whole host of other &quot;establishment&#39; members are very clearly Anti-English and Anti-white.  Self-loathers who are putting the finishing touches to giving our country away.  Whether this is to the EU or a army of 3rd world  rapist and welfare ponces, they dont mind.  Fortunately there remains a rump of England that enthusiastically rejects these marxists.
Comment389	DRAIN THE SWAMP
Comment390	Sooo, BoJo , who have been raging about the E.U in the last 3 years. Who claims , that the U.K needs to wrestle back &quot;control&quot; from E.U just asked the E.U to convice parlament to sort out this mess. You know what the E.U will answer? &quot; No, we don&#39;t get involved in domestic politics.&quot; Go figure, U.K has full control of the steering wheel but has no clue how to use it.
Comment391	Perhaps the UK should rule a general election to stop this ridicule political Brexit &quot;farting circus&quot; in the House of Commons? Perhaps &quot;Princess Snow White&quot; Jeremy Corbyn should finally take that &quot;Wicked Queen&quot; Boris Johnson´s possibly &quot;poisoned&quot; general election &quot;apple&quot;, what Corbyn before wanted and desired, taste it and begin to wait with his loyal Dwarfs for a young handsome Prince, who will kissing wake him to a new morning of Socialism or possibly rising and growing &quot;solar spectrum&quot; of Nationalism and National Romanticism in the sky of the UK and the &quot;Fourth Reich&quot; EU?
Comment392	The double standed of &quot;the left&quot; leaves me completely dumbfounded. People were prosecuted heckling and abusing Anna Soubry. Then they do the absolute same in larger numbers. Its partly the reason why people just think they&#39;re insane.
Comment393	This just showed one part cant make a difference.
Comment394	Parliament betrays democracy yet again and Corbyn talks of Jonson blackmailing Parliament. The almost Leader of the Opposition has cognitive problems. I was relieved to hear the &#39;deal&#39; had been rejected, that clears the way for a WTO terms exit.
Comment395	British Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked the EU to postpone Brexit until the end of the day on January 31, 2020, according to a letter from the head of the Cabinet of Ministers to the head of the European Council Donald Tusk.
Comment396	The Act only states he must request an extension, doesn&#39;t mean he has to agree with it or can&#39;t state his opinion
Comment 396.1	The parliament agrees to it, not Boris. Boris kicked out his majority, so he will continue to lose every vote.
Comment 396.2	Chris A checkmate Remoaners!
Comment397	Why Respect the politicians vote,  if they are not going to respect the people Vote ?
Comment 397.1	@Blue Sky it&#39;s a representative democracy, that is how our democratic system works.
Comment 397.2	@Richard + That is not how democracy work.
Comment 397.3	Because one of them is legally binding
Comment398	In every divorce the kids suffer.......us.
Comment399	I think wales and Scotland will cause some trauma because of the deal Ireland has gotten. But I did say so many times, I&#39;ve said Northern Ireland has become a geo-graphical area that is used in a similar fashion as Indian call centres are so it has a special case for economic flexibility. But I wonder, do people feel they got the Brexit they desired?
Comment400	If an extension is granted it will be seen as a hostile act by a foreign power.<br />Britain drifts towards civil war
Comment 400.1	I wasn&#39;t talking tough, I was making an observation.<br />By the way, when actually was it that the left won anything?<br />2nd ww it was the right in control<br />Falklands again the right<br />Oh yes I remember the left won an illegal war didn&#39;t they Mr. Blair.
Comment 400.2	Majority of the country is on the right side of the political spectrum so I think your the ones who are outnumbered. The differing delusional lefties you have no chance.
Comment401	The liberal media and remainers in the house are untrustworthy vipers. I can’t wait for an election to get rid of the scum of proud self serving labour, liberal mps. Go on Boris keep representing the majority of English people.
Comment402	This just means that we will leave without a deal
Comment 402.1	@fidel castro I don&#39;t think that - it was a rhetorical question for you.
Comment 402.2	@fidel castro And the EU wants to lose that trade?
Comment403	Britrix
Comment404	These mps are bunch of sell outs 🤦🏻‍♂️
Comment405	Johnson &amp; his gang do not respect the peoples vote which is very clear. After the referendum May organized an election and the British people voted for the people who will represent them the best in the parliament.<br />Everybody who calls the parliament members who voted against the proposals of Johnson &quot;traitors who do not what the people have voted for&quot; they are incredible bad or incredible stupid. After the result the voters started to think about the Brexit...was it what they wanted? Did they want the Tories to represent them? Well May lost the majority which should tell enough about what the British voters want: they voted for the people to represent them and anybody who do not respect the results of the votes in the parliaments do not respect what the British people voted for. <br />Johnson is not only a liar and a cheater, he has no respect for what the British people voted for. He wasn&#39;t chosen by the British people.
Comment406	They don’t want to do it simple as that.
Comment407	Can’t stop laughing. This story is hilarious 😂😂😂. You wanna leave then please go.
Comment 407.1	Thomas Schiller bye bye 👋
Comment408	All these scum traitors are like terminators they never stop. See the BBC let Alistair Cambell blame the far right for causing trouble  without any proof, shit weasels
Comment409	Every one off them should be sacked   they only think about them and them only
Comment410	God knows why this Brexit is not happening yet.We need to pray for the right decision 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Comment411	He lied and said the mps deferred the vote but it was boris because he didnt like the law that got passed on it.
Comment412	15 And he (the prophet) said, Hearken ye, all (BREXIT) Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great (REMOANER) multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.
Comment413	The letter was ghost written
Comment414	No deal
Comment415	Bravo no deal  delay brexit
Comment416	Sick of the them all. Boris has sold us out too, his Treaty is not Brexit. VOTE BREXIT PARTY AT NEXT OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR REFERENDUM VOTE TO MATTER.
Comment417	No deal/crash out/clean break brexit first week;<br /><br /> Day one: The leave lot celebrate, the value of the sterling drops dramatically.<br /><br />Day two: Government raise taxes, the leave lot realise there is no going back to talks with the EU as they are a competitor now and blame the remain people.<br /><br />Day three: Without access to EU trade routes and no trade deals finalized with anyone else food, medicine and other supplies begin to run low, stockpiling occurs.<br /><br />Day four: businesses finalize their relocation resulting in high unemployment and homelessness.<br /><br />Day five: recession in full swing, a mass emigration occurs increasing taxes resulting in an extremely top heavy population.<br /><br />Day six: civil unrest as the leavers become violent like rabid dogs biting at anyone or anything. November 6th the PM goes to court gets off on fabricated technicalities.<br /><br />Day seven: the dup are kicked out of ignored northern Ireland, the mistreated Scotland makes for independence. Britain falls apart but most importantly humbled and everyone is better off.(apart the people now dead or homeless)
Comment 417.1	utter nonsense, but funny nonetheless.
Comment418	Historical day for PARLIAMENT, exactly Corbyn....... More than half of the population voted leave, 70% of that parliament voted remain...... I hope even the remoaners realize how important it is for us to honor the vote and not let parliament win. Future votes won&#39;t matter if parliament know they can worm their way out of it. Boris improved the deal in weeks, just imagine what could have been done in THREE YEARS if they accepted the vote and worked together for a good deal!!! Instead they scheme and work against each other to stop it. They have embarrassed us in front of the world!
Comment419	Babylon Broadca-sting🐝 Corporation 😠
Comment420	Once again Ireland has said the rest of the U.K. Doesn&#39;t matter ,, only Irish issues matter and have voted to keep us all in the E.U ? The U.K. Will break up altogether with this lot in parliament ,,
Comment421	How childish.
Comment422	What an arse Boris is
Comment423	Don’t pay the TV licence fee. Don’t fund propaganda
Comment424	Boris Johnson has behaved so badly, I’m sure many MPS (incl Teresa May) must be secretly very pleased that Boris has to send a letter. He has caused this problem.....he definitely could have got Brexit through if he had worked with parliament.....
Comment425	Is there a word in the OED that describes the present members of the House of Commons? I’m looking for a word that adequately describes a band of ignorant traitors to democracy and that incorporates flavours of debauchery, idiocy, ignorance, pomposity, self opinionated blithering imbeciles, troglodytes, political prostitutes, hypocrites, deceivers, liars and fools. At present, the OED fails me. I’m sure Churchill would have had the word....sigh.
Comment426	Nigel Farage doesn’t want this deal! He wants a delay and an election. Brexit is impossible... that’s the truth... banging on about democracy is all leavers can do..... that’s not an argument... Brexit is not going to work for the UK, uk will break up....  many leavers have changed their minds....
Comment 426.1	So you asked all 17.4 million people then? Well done.
Comment427	remainers in parliament should be ashamed of themselves,we voted out you clowns!
Comment428	BBC continues to sow the seeds for a second referendum.
Comment429	We all know who&#39;s to blame for this  , the Speaker  J.B . He once again he let  Oliver Letwing blow the whole thing out of the window. ...what&#39;s the difference between the Speaker J. B.and God ......God does not think he is the Speaker. .
Comment430	I&#39;m sick of this drama
Comment431	Can I suggest paper ballots? At least Russia won&#39;t eff with you all in England...best of luck...don&#39;t leave!
Comment432	Since referendum, These politicians doing nothing for the working class people i. e. Standard of living getting worse for British people... Vote Brexit party.
Comment433	Who was daft enough to believe that the eu was going to give up a £12 billion a year cash cow easily ?<br />Not to worry I am kept fully up to date with unbias news from the BBC.🤣🤣🤣
Comment434	Awww ffs we british are being made to look like clowns to the world because of these clowns supposedly running the country. Delay delay delay delay democracy don’t make me laugh this is just holding a country to ransom. Clearly the opposition doesn’t want brexit so they keep voting against everything dirty politics 100%. The public voted for it why don’t you listen I’ll tell you because the U.K. has become corrupt 😔<br />Democracy what’s happened to our democracy it’s turned into a dictatorship 😔<br />We need to get rid of the conservatives now!!! they’ve stitched the british people right up. Vote Lib Dem’s vote brexit party vote independent vote anyone if you don’t want labour. But don’t vote conservatives they’ve betrayed the whole country and made decisions that have destroyed lives. Come on U.K. wake up<br />Are all the remainders Liverpool fans loooool ??? Never walk alone 🤦‍♂️
Comment435	Don&#39;t you just love the British socialist broadcasting service , eeerm I mean the bbc
Comment436	Good man Boris never mind the grovelling remoaners.
Comment437	Corbyn has just shown that he will vote against the brexit deal no matter what the government does. Corbyn has proved to the people that he is against them and he did not agree with the 17.4 million people and he wonts to stay in the European Parliament
Comment438	GBP went up 2% in a week, whats going on? ORDAAAAAa
Comment439	A stay in the EU is in England financial intrests! Don&#39;t be stupid and leave...it will destroy the country and bring a strong boarder to Ireland!
Comment 439.1	If you watched the parliamentary debate you would know that neither of those things is true. 1) The bank of England has said the new deal will cause a net profit for the UK as businesses have been hoarding money to deal with the transition and it is the uncertainty that is making the UK poorer. 2) the new deal removes the Irish backstop( the hard boarder)which has been causing so many problems and continues with a soft boarder that only 1% of goods need to be checked
Comment440	Peoples vote.....funded by EU. <br />London. <br /><br />What more needs to be said
Comment441	Irony is most of them, being London are EU migrants. <br /><br />Business never sleeps, so why are they not working
Comment442	Selfish MP’s
Comment443	The e.u protect paedophiles and sack people who complain about their paedophiles... fact
Comment444	Fuck off BBC and die.
Comment445	Tony Benn would have taken us out.
Comment446	BBC =  Anti Democracy + Remaind
Comment447	The remainers are acting like a spoiled child that doesn&#39;t get its way changing the rules again and again untill they win,,,, That is the end of democracy and the end of Great Britain. Shame on the SNP, Lib dems and Corbyn.
Comment448	It shows how low the UK has sunk thanks to successive government&#39;s policies over the years when we have to grovel to a foreign political project. Leave now on WTO terms to extricate ourselves fully whilst we still can.
Comment449	Mr.Blackford<br /> u and the SNP are &quot; SHAFTING &quot; the Scots 😡
Comment 449.1	BS
Comment450	Donald Trump openly asking China for help in breaking American laws, and Boris Johnson openly asking the European Union for help in breaking British laws. Entitled aristocrats that never had to work and worry in their lives, and only represent their moneyed friends. If the situation in their countries deteriorates, the majority will live in misery, but the rich will still live in privilege. <br /><br />But we all get the government we vote for, unless and until we slide back into dictatorships and absolute monarchies. We are not too far from that.<br />More properly, every country gets the government we deserve.
Comment 450.1	I don&#39;t get the exact details but how could american law have legal force to EU (EU is souvereign to US)?<br /><br />This argument has no meaning.
Comment451	We see how the media is demonizing the government for trying to support democracy yet it doesn&#39;t report on the millions of people who want Brexit done, this also includes the EU countries. BBC =Biased Broadcasting Company
Comment452	I hope the general election is soon labour need to be voted out of their seats. We can’t  have this delay at £250m a week it’s killing our economy, reputation and ripping the UK apart.  The worst parliament in Morden history.
Comment453	the prime minister thinks he&#39;s above the law but all of the MPs in there think they are above the people and that they can just  make decisions on whatever they want
Comment454	<b>UNDERWORLD PART XXX</b><br />Victor wakes up after a century of hibernation<br />Finds out UK is still seeking BREXIT delay<br />Victor:I ain&#39;t shit sucking these morons blood, don&#39;t wake me up again Salena dear.<br /><br /><b>The end</b>
Comment455	We need to leave the EU because if we look at are history for the 1600’s senior. The uk had a empire and if Parliament won’t stand out so the Government Adan get Breckit done. And we need to now how many people in Parliament was born in the EU so we can find why they won’t let us leave. And Parliament broke the law and the court broke the law as they are betraying the Country and did they ask the Queen if she thinks what the Government was lawful?
Comment456	Leave that&#39;s what we voted for and won fuckin leave don&#39;t need the EU lets run our own country not dick heads from the EU fuckin leave
Comment457	You did not see any &quot;Please dont leave the EU&quot; protests on the EU side.<br />No country wants or needs UK in the EU. And the EU people clearly reflect that...
Comment 457.1	@Jon Seymour my man. UK got no money. Not sure where your misinformation comes from. You got a queen qnd a cheap Trump knock off as your masters...the fuck you talk &#39;bout dictator ship? Fuck the common wealth grip you still got on nations...
Comment 457.2	But the EU needs our money for its failing would-be superstate. We need to leave ASAP and get away from this poisonous dictatorship.
Comment458	As Usual, BBC Left wing Bias, Remainers being aggressive, WE VOTED LEAVE, Which bit of LEAVE don&#39;t you traitors understand?
Comment459	ORRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEEERRRRR!!!!!!!!&#39;<br /><br />I bet that guy will tell us all the ways order can be said…<br /><br />See it soon on netflix
Comment 459.1	For Whatever kinda annoying he is
Comment460	This crisis can be resolved only if you vote labour out
Comment461	This is b*<b>****</b> the EU have always done this too<br /> countries making them vote again and again on democratic decisions
Comment 461.1	If you&#39;re referring to the self harmer/leaver tired horse that was the lisbon treaty it was amended and then put to the people again as the change in the deal as with any minute alteration to exactly what the people voted for should be.
Comment462	Is Boris now going to die in a ditch?
Comment 462.1	Hopefully all the remainers will.
Comment463	Bolsheviks are winning..
Comment464	Johnson believes he is above the law! Why is anyone suprised given  his Bullingdon boys days  and the women and children he&#39;s screwed over
Comment465	Maybe they will refuse to give an extension because Boris didn&#39;t sign the letter..thus Bojo tricks us into his beloved no deal.
Comment466	Better to stay in the e.u ..these clowns have no idea what ia goin on
Comment467	They should start heating up the prison cell Boris Johnson visited some weeks ago. Because it will be his new home soon. Well, that&#39;s the better case. The more unpleasant case is that he is hanging at some tree, when it became true, that he broke the law and forced the UK in a catastrophic no deal Brexit which was excluded by parliament. And you, down there in the comments, screaming for no deal Brexit hiding behind your anonymity, some of you earning money for their traitorship, some of you just incredible stupid, your grandchilds will ask you: &quot;How the heck it was possible you all were so stupid to let these things happen?&quot; You can start to work on your answer already, because you have to create some sweet lies about you. Happy Brexit, happy sinking!
Comment 467.1	@Eternal Goof you&#39;re sick and evil.   And a typical hateful remainer.
Comment 467.2	@Jon Seymour Do you still torture your wife?
Comment 467.3	Why do you think a dictatorship like the Eu is good?
Comment468	Boris is a petulant child.
Comment469	Corbin trying too wreck this country with a no deal
Comment470	get out !
Comment471	EU grant a an extension,  lol, they only make 39 billion a year on it, why bother ?? FFS, britian is not allowed to say or do anything except pay, so why wouldn&#39;t they grant an extension, oh yes they are really nice people that except democracy, NOT
Comment472	Laura Kuntberg and the rest of the Biased Broadcasting Corporation
Comment473	Boris Johnson will resign before brexit ends
Comment474	This is the reason I don&#39;t pay my licence fee with utterly bias reports like this.
Comment475	Bahaha remoaner tears, it&#39;s raining tears <br /><br />NO DEAL HERE WE COME..
Comment476	What kind of world are we living in when we allow these posh boys who act like spoiled children at an aunties  garden party in the house of commons, idiots decide what future our children and grandchildren will have. Its time to do another referendum on this and let it stand now the people of this country are better informed, stop calling it Brexit at least use the proper context it sounds like a cereal bar!!
Comment477	What knobs, would anyone have ever heard of Laura Kuntsberg without Brexit
Comment 477.1	She&#39;s been around for years.
Comment478	Why are you looking at this from a pro remain angle ? You should be looking at the way Labour are using  plots and subterfuge dressed up as &quot;concern for workers rights&quot;  to stop the enactment of the referendum result . It is a coup against democracy. Time for the BBC to fund themselves this bias is just wrong . The Brexit Party are coming and this coup will only push more people towards them.
Comment479	what&#39;s the UK doing in the past three years?  out of Eu or not? nothing but delay?
Comment480	Brexshit 😆😆😆😆
Comment481	No deal 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳👌
Comment482	More rancid remainers with their uk hating actions.
Comment 482.1	@Jon Seymour thats not true, i don&#39;t hate democracy, im not a traitor, and im certainly not anti-British. where do you get these ideas from?
Comment 482.2	@Daniel Watson I agree. Remaining makes no sense. Only a democracy-hating anti-British traitor would want to remain.
Comment 482.3	@Jon Seymour a bad idea leaving!! it makes no sense!
Comment 482.4	@Daniel Watson bad idea remaining? I agree.
Comment 482.5	@Jon Seymour Mass Immigration? cleaver you for repeating phases you hear. Everyone is moving all over the world these days - im living in Switzerland for a year, I have friends who live in Nepal, that struggle to come visit, my last girlfriend was Bulgarian, who are you to stop people living free.  How does this ruin our country??
Comment483	They should stop complaining he did what they commanded and sent the letter!😂
Comment484	Deliberating for years to device roadmap to Brexit, but the British divided India in 4 months, done by a Lawyer who never visited India.
Comment485	No deal and out! We need to free ourselves. No matter what happens there will be protests and riots
Comment 485.1	@Plo Koon we want to leave, no strings attached. That&#39;s what we voted for but our politicians dont want that
Comment 485.2	What you mean free? The EU has left the door wide open! They are sick of these gestures by Parliament and the prime minister. It&#39;s you brits who can&#39;t decide what to do.
Comment486	Bojo sends an unsigned letter to save the country and another letter to please the party. Go figure where his priorities lie!
Comment487	The public wants Brexit and we will deliver. I don&#39;t see 1 million people after for Boris&#39;s deal outside parliament. Why are they so reluctant to give the people what they actually want.
Comment488	I have sent a letter to kick Britain out without a deal. Just cold turkey. Take your suitcase and go!
Comment 488.1	Fantastic! Can you not get some more Europeans to do the same? We could use the help to get around the treasonous remainers.
Comment489	"Who the f*<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kis"">#kis</a> that yelling dude, shouting out when ever theres a report or interview outside Wstmntr. He sounds like the voice of the end of the world or some fuckn alien caller - so nightmarish- dont let ya kids hear that shit- hes depressing, he is so iritating. Is that what u guys call the town cryer? What a pain in the ass. Pay him to fuck off while yr filming!"
Comment490	Wow. The bias of the bbc knows no bounds.
Comment491	Beeb kissing the arse of the worst people in the country. Surprised you didn’t get Farage on again.
Comment492	We vote leave and PMs want to remain. We never voted for an extension. they did. couldn&#39;t make it up. what a joke the UK looks now.
Comment 492.1	Labor party is a shame now. Just like some philosophers proclaimed thousands of years ago, democracy will lead to weakness and corruption and useless, then dictatorship show up.
Comment 492.2	@Maria Bianchi it&#39;s not going to be good if the EU 27 members don&#39;t agree with the extension
Comment 492.3	Of course they voted for an extension. They’re trying to get a deal for the country, to follow along with their vote they can’t just leave without a deal. For the love of Christ that’s illegal! All these people going on like ‘deal or no deal let’s leave’ and you can’t do that.
Comment 492.4	@Tom Ripley politicians will be to blame if we leave with no deal  they are all as bad as one another
Comment 492.5	Nicholas Walker it’s looked a joke for some time now. Government are a sham
Comment493	Excellent, don&#39;t back the deal. Out on wto. Parliament is slowly cutting its throat. Hey ho!
Comment494	Lol Forget leaving because it ain’t gonna happen not in a million years

Comment 494.2	max macdonald The joke is on you because I voted Leave mate 🤣🤣😂
Comment 494.3	You lost, get over it. No one likes a remoaner! Ha ha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comment495	See how abusive the remaniacs are...  they are the problem of this country
Comment496	Previously on Brexit...<br /><br />One of the best drama, ever.
Comment 496.1	And it’s confirmed it will have more seasons
Comment497	Its not about the country in Parliament its all about political voting. They should all be fired.
Comment498	Does BJ think if he deosn&#39;t sign the letter for the extension it counts as him not asking for an extension? 😅
Comment 498.1	I believe he&#39;s trying to sabotage.
Comment499	Good on you Boris for not signing the letter. These MPs make me sick. Get Brexit done and dusted so we can move on with taking our country forward
Comment500	I voted to remain, now I just want to leave and I would never vote labour again
Comment501	&quot;DEAD IN A DITCH&quot; it is then Boris.
Comment 501.1	Come on Johny, since when do you expect Boris to keep his word?
Comment 501.2	One could only hope
Comment 501.3	He should just refleck on how he got there.Johnson the ditch has a certain ring to it
Comment502	Brexit must go through!  Even with a NO DEAL!
Comment 502.1	@Maria Bianchi not if the EU deny an extension
Comment 502.2	Dedalus69 yeah but that’s illegal
Comment503	Like it or not, the people have put the country in this position and the people are the ones that can unlock the situation. A second referendum is the only way to get a closure.
Comment 503.1	@Jon Seymour Very smart reply. It&#39;s not what I want, rather it is what will resolve the situation. You will win anyway, so it is a win win situation for Brexiteers.
Comment 503.2	We already had a referendum, why do you want a losers vote?
Comment504	Boris &#39;dead in a ditch&#39; Johnson
Comment 504.1	Alexander Boris De&#39;Ditch Johnson
Comment505	The UK parliament is a joke. The UK will never be &quot;Great&quot; again.
Comment 505.1	@Pendle Eldnep I agree.
Comment 505.2	@Jon Seymour perhaps because despite a referendum it appears the political classes refuse to obey their masters.
Comment 505.3	@BasterMater5000 thank you.
Comment 505.4	... Damn you think they wanted &#39;Fabulous Britain&#39; before they decided to on Great Britain? <br /><br />It&#39;s called great Britain because it refers to the &#39;Greater&#39; geographical areas of Britain.
Comment 505.5	@Pendle Eldnep explain why you hate democracy and the UK so much.
Comment506	Fuck Northern Ireland
Comment507	BBC, PARLIAMENT, MEDIA... SCUM!!!!!!!!!!!
Comment508	No deal is closer now
Comment509	Of course a delay will be a mistake, Boris. Your ditch awaits.
Comment510	This is a fake news broadcaster<br />Do not believe anything that it spews our<br />It is biased against the British <br />People<br /><br />Get the genuine news from social media

Comment515	Finally a leader for the people. Well done Boris!!
Comment516	Corbyn slams Johnson for defying a law passed with a majority of 16 whilst trying to overturn a vote by the majority of the country to leave the EU. Go figure. We need to clear the swamp.
Comment 516.1	Yet only one was legally binding..
Comment517	Only way is force no deal , boris call nigel for help you will not get liked by this country if you use that treaty
Comment518	People are stupid if they actually believe parliament will back any deal <br />Why would they? At least 70 percent of them are remainers
Comment 518.1	I don&#39;t think Boris expected to get it across the line, but every time the remainers are showing themselves to be undemocratic and hypocritical. Their defiance is not for the people but for themselves.
Comment519	JO SWINSON IS THE BIGGEST SCUMBAG IN THE HOC!!

Comment524	I voted remain but this is going on for too long. What&#39;s wrong with those people protesting don&#39;t they work? So they want to hear about this non stop still when we got better things to think about? Get a life
Comment525	unfortunately, Brexit will take place since the Queen pronounced it a few weeks ago, so we&#39;re all looking at an illusion, a farce
Comment 525.1	I think you mean, fortunately.
Comment526	Just leave for the love of god
Comment527	Children Please...and to think we pay all these kids wages. its all a joke
Comment528	But I thought &quot;it will take 5 minutes to get a new deal...&quot; if &quot;leave&quot; won in the referendum. Brexit is a bad deal for everyone no matter what. STOP BREXIT
Comment529	What was the point of the referendum when the MPs clearly don&#39;t want what the general population do want. A lot of people voted leave. 3 years later  still no further on. Parliament has been conning the general population for centuries. Forever promising &quot;We won&#39;t do xyz&quot; and then they do. &quot;We will do xyz&quot; and then they don&#39;t. It&#39;s the same with welfare reform &quot; Work pays&quot; not on a zero hours contract. Universal Credit will help people back into work and people will be better off financially. Not when you&#39;re disabled and keep getting sanctioned or have v a terminal illness and get sanctioned. I won&#39;t ever be voting again because it doesn&#39;t count for shit anymore.
Comment530	Boris playing games with people&#39;s livelihoods.
Comment531	Perhaps Ministers feel they are overworked by voting on a Saturday. Please give these guys a break so they can get their minds set. Get Brexit Done HASHTAG. Enough of this waste, let&#39;s move on !
Comment532	We are leaving on the 31st of October <br />Oh no we are not <br />Oh yes we are <br />Oh no we are not <br />Oh yes we are <br />Oh no we can’t <br />Oh yes we can <br />Oh no we can’t <br />Oh yes we can <br />Oh yes we will <br />Oh no we won’t <br />Oh yes we will <br />Oh no we won’t <br />We are the laughing stock of the world <br />These lot couldn’t run a bath<br />We have more pressing issues to deal with in the UK and these lot carry on with the Brexit pantomime
Comment533	Can we the people do what guy folkes tried do an blow these away in British style fuck them   <br /><br />He was for the people <br /><br />Think we celebrate 5th of november <br /><br />Celebrate nothing the govt have done <br /><br />We morn our dead while our govt gear up for another
Comment534	What the hell is wrong with labour they don&#39;t want election they dont want Brexit, if there is a second referendum it might keep your corporate business happy corbyn but the people will be out in streets and there will be so much problems. For god sake get it done once you come out of EU if there is anything you need from EU make another seperate agreement for each issue
Comment535	That ditch he said he rather be dead in would it be the English Channel?
Comment536	The city against Luxembourg: let&#39;s have a NETFLIX SEASON
Comment 536.1	City, sorry THE WAR OF THE ROSES
Comment537	No deal is the only way
Comment538	Fuck brexit and fuck this country
Comment539	I think mr. Johnson will be held in contempt of parliament now by the Scottish high court. He did not sign the letter, and he wrote accompanying letters to weaken the Benn act letter. That is forbidden by the British Supreme court. It would be very strange to see a PM arrested for contempt of court (and parliament) without parliament being able to fire him. I think the Brexit is an impossible project that overstretches what a modern democratic administration can do in peacetime. I have said that all along. The whole referendum was impossible. I hope you guys on that islad keep it peaceful.
Comment540	Sad to see EU flags fly... <br />What happened to:  🇬🇧  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🇮🇪 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿...?
Comment 540.1	@Rumblefish Ummm.... No? We are the constituent nations of the U.K, nothing shameful about us, if anything the EU flag flying in London would offend every non-remoaner in the country...
Comment 540.2	Our flags offend certain people ?
Comment541	We had a vote to leave, those who lost that vote should grow up and accept it! Pick your toys up and put them back in your pram! If they want a public vote to decide on the terms, then do it, however Remain should NOT be on the ballot paper! Just two options: with a deal or without. Simple.
Comment542	BBC go to hell!
Comment543	Wiping their feet on the UK people?
Comment544	😸😸😸😸😸😸😸🤝👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻<br />When where how <br />Come on yes or no finish it<br />People in uk are so tired 😓 <br />Finish all this mess<br />This is Cold War <br />People try to leave uk as is getting coldest and colder every day 🤒💀<br />I learn to don’t stress my self for life because is short and fun is all human need
Comment545	If Boris can send two letters in violation of the law, then surely we can legally have two national opinion polls aka referenda.
Comment 545.1	A law invented a few weeks ago - a law which inhibits the action of a referendum ?
Comment546	If a government wants a second referendum.. Isn&#39;t that illegal because its not what was voted for?!
Comment547	We want out we democratically voted democratically to leave Europe those that oppose are the traitors to Britain and will not be forgotten
Comment548	Wot MPs working Saturday, no doubt Corbyn want double time and a dinner money <br /><br />Of course the EU will be.breathing a sigh of relief.<br />They are hoping that Britain wlil tire  out and just give up..<br />The next election will be interesting.
Comment549	It is disgusting! Parliament have totally ignored the democracy of the people who won the vote to LEAVE the EU.....be careful Parliament there are thousands more who have had enough and want to LEAVE!
Comment550	Heforgot to sign it 🤭🤣🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣🤣 ge fukin played them 🤣🤣🤣
Comment551	Tusk negotiation..Take it or leave it.
Comment552	By sending an official letter saying the extension is not the PMs or the Government’s wishes put the EU in a very awkward position as they will in yer face has to override the wishes of the sovereign government with whom they have to negotiate.  All out in the midday sun. I sadly expect the unelected political courts to declare his letter illegal and request it be withdrawn obeying the SNP scorched earth policy.
Comment553	Boris should have sent one more letter to the EU. A copy of his resignation.
Comment 553.1	@David Brisbane Who do you think could fill the post of PM?  Our government is disfunctional and not fit for purpose.  Too many splinter parties who can&#39;t agree on anything.
Comment 553.2	@English Rose <br />To shown them a serious person will be dealing with them very soon.
Comment 553.3	Why would he do that?  The EU do not employ Johnson.
Comment554	&quot;bad for our European Union&quot;? Sorry, who&#39;s European Union? Ours? Ours!? You can&#39;t call it ours when you want out!
Comment555	😂
Comment556	Can we get on with BREXIT? The more we delay, the longer it will take us to get back in to the EU.
Comment557	Time to get rid of these remaining MPs
Comment558	PM is παληκαρι.it is a good deal but  Britain will try to be European people.
Comment559	Revocation and the death of UK democracy and a Federal European Empire as Verhofstat called it recently<br />Appauling. .
Comment560	I’m sick off it!!!! We voted to leave years ago and some MPs are trying there hardest to stop Brexit all together!? I say treason!!
Comment561	They are just a bunch of puppets ! The globalist elite are in charge !BREXIT NOW NO DEAL !! Just leave it&#39;s been over 3 years where is the democracy !!! What a joke !
Comment562	Maybe the UK can just sit on the wall like Humpty Dumpty. What can go wrong?
Comment563	Here is a copy of a comment flouting around in public - &quot;The year is 2187. The British Prime Minister visits Brussels to beg for an extension of the Brexit deadline. Nobody remembers where this tradition came from, but every year it attracts many tourists&quot;
Comment 563.1	Best comment ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is why I look in the comments section!
Comment 563.2	🏅🏅🏅
Comment564	Im not much for politicians anywhere in the world, but you in the uk must have the worst of them. Is it a bunch of homeless guys that you have gathered up?<br />They seem totally incapable of making a single decision.<br />Where watching the uk implode, people divided, arguing...<br />Just leave, please. Everybody is tired of this madness.
Comment565	Joe swinson and corbin only care about them selves dossers
Comment566	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xhny-VF4-Y&amp;t=6m17s"">6:17</a> We now switch to our BBC stagey-cam in the specially built staging-reaction area. Please do no feed the cucks."
Comment567	7.12 Boris has been at the sauce ? Who can blame him arrr it&#39;s the pressure

Comment572	Bad losers filling the streets outside Parliament
Comment573	How many of the protestors have uk passports?
Comment 573.1	as opposed to EU ones?
Comment574	Time for a new government the Tories are the ones to blame for this tremendous shit show we call Brexit sick to death of hearing the word. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of the EU but to stop freedom of movement to leave without no real thought or planning is bloody stupid not gonna vote for anything that&#39;s gonna cost jobs and workers rights or the standard of our healthcare or the quality of our food. The poorest in this country have been suffering for almost a decade and that ain&#39;t the EUs fault it&#39;s the fault of the tories, seriously does anyone with half a brain cell think that standard of living will improve under their leadership?? Wake up!!! They&#39;ve cut deals with their rich wealthy mates to drag this country into another recession and by up Britain on the cheap.
Comment575	Its parliament that have put the country in this shit hole if they told the truth to start with we would not be in this shit hole shame on parliament
Comment576	Even this can not deliver a Brexit and does not help us. Where is plan b or did not read Boris the Schlieffen-plan?
Comment577	Just revoke the bloody thing and move on!
Comment 577.1	Why do you hate democracy so much?
Comment578	Scaremongering from some at it&#39;s finest. Scared to take risks are we?
Comment579	Talk about Corbyn calling the kettle black. How could we ever trust him when he said he would support the result of the referendum. He is a massive liar!!!
Comment580	Boris Johnson borrowed Trump&#39;s sharpie to sign off on the letter - then it magically and mysteriously washed right off
Comment581	If Boris can send two letters, then surely there can be two referenda.
Comment582	"😂😂😂😂 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xhny-VF4-Y&amp;t=4m29s"">4:29</a>  is May on heroin or has she got  Junkers drink flask in her handbag ?"
Comment583	Liz Saville Roberts bit of a GILF
Comment584	Its their MPs whos gonna destroy UK itself. Not the PM
Comment 584.1	PM is as much a liar as Donald trump.... And can not be trusted.... He is two faced as his back stabbing of his leader before him demonstrated, a failed foreign secretary who supported blatant lies plastered on the side of a big red bus in the original referendum!!!!
Comment585	Only 16 votes.  Demand a 2nd vote!!
Comment586	Childish nonsense (two contradictory letters!) from a public schoolboy joke of a prime minister.
Comment587	An estimate indicates that more a million leave voters has passed away due to age and bad health since 2016....a further delay absolutely make sence.
Comment 587.1	@Mary Sackfield No,I have no such needs.
Comment 587.2	You need to read the “Great Deception” by Christopher Booker.
Comment 587.3	@Mary Sackfield Its statistically a established fact.
Comment 587.4	So you are presuming all young people have voted to remain? This is not the case,    and regarding the healthy lifestyle, your wrong there as well.
Comment 587.5	@Mary Sackfield A few....Remainers are relatively younger and have healthier lifestyle.....education,being more aware and updated. Remain also get &quot;refilled&quot; from the young ones coming eligble to vote.
Comment588	HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE CAPTIONS, BBC?? Your content is so inaccessible in so many ways, the very least you could do is accommodate viewers who need it by providing a basic function or feature YouTube practically offers automatically... Geez
Comment589	Agree with a people vote - hang on, we have had one.   Shouldn&#39;t their banners say - Another peoples vote because we didn&#39;t get the answer we wanted last time -disgusting ! - Lets just get it done, we have a country to run
Comment590	British Parliament is Jeremy Kyle on steroids
Comment591	Rude man ...completely unacceptable.what sort of savage doesn’t sign a letter?
Comment 591.1	Martin Baldwin-Edwards yes I,m afraid you are right...no manners...lies ,cheats thinks he’s above all.
Comment 591.2	An Etonian public schoolboy who thinks he is smarter than he really is.
Comment592	If the opposition has a better idea, why don&#39;t they come out with it.
Comment 592.1	@Derek Scanlan the difference is the polls in the US were before the election, and were wrong about the outcome. They don&#39;t rerun an election just because the losers don&#39;t like the result. The polls in the UK predicted a remain win. Finally polls are just predictions, the results are the real deal.
Comment 592.2	@Michael like the polls that said hillary would be president? the people seem to want their say once again!
Comment 592.3	@Peter Fysh saying people lied isn&#39;t enough, you have to veritably prove that it affected the way they voted. Then you have to make sure the other side isn&#39;t guilty of the same thing. Like remainers saying there will be world war 3, a recession etc. Then you have to base that on current polling which shows leave has increased 2% from 52% to 54%. So if after 3 years you believe more information has become available which changes things in favour of remain we would see that change in the polling data.
Comment 592.4	My Space.....Second Referendum with whole truth...
Comment593	Bring it to the people. Parliament can&#39;t take decision. Kindergarten.
Comment 593.1	All ready done. They don&#39;t want to do it. It&#39;s doing what people said, but they don&#39;t want to do it.
Comment 593.2	No that already happend
Comment594	Life...every choice deserve a second look. especially upon further consideration.
Comment 594.1	Would love to relook our choice of defeating isis man.
Comment595	Now we are going to crash out because of the muppets  that are ment to serve the winning  democratic vote of the people,  shameful
Comment596	He did not sign the letter. Thereby invalidating the content ?
Comment 596.1	Hardly - he sent another letter with it saying he sent it. That;s ok as far as the EU goes.
Comment597	The PM sends a letter to the EU asking for an extension, a letter which he was compelled to by law if politicians did not support any deal he put forward on the 19th October 2019 and he deliberately does not sign it which basically makes the letter invalid. WHAT KIND OF A FOOL DO WE HAVE FOR A PM? DOES HE REALLY THINK THE COURTS WILL LET HIM GET AWAY WITH THIS CHILDISH STUNT, UNBELIEVABLE!!! 🤦
Comment 597.1	@MAX POWER So make a law making it legal to leave the EU - or are you a deliberate moron?
Comment 597.2	@Pendle Eldnep Your argument is irrelevant according to the judicial system of the UK IT IS LEGAL so regardless of how valid or invalid your arguments against it are it doesn&#39;t make it any less so. Anyway it&#39;s all a moot point since it seems the extension letter doesn&#39;t require the PM signature to be  valid which means I was wrong about BJ being a fool, at least for this.
Comment 597.3	@MAX POWER How can a law made by the UK override article 50 of an EU treaty if we haven&#39;t left the EU?<br /><br /><br />For the Benn Act to be legal we need to leave the EU first!!<br /><br /><br />or are we free to override EU law already?
Comment 597.4	@Pendle Eldnep It&#39;s still a law regardless of whether you like it or not.
Comment 597.5	What?! a childish stunt like passing a law which makes leaving the EU illegal?
Comment598	I see Corbin is jumping in with his odd uptake on the present progress.This man is noted for his fence sitting until he can find a morsel that might make him look loke he is on the ball.
Comment599	The letter is as legal as a piece of shit paper,not signed,not legal
Comment600	What cluster fuck up
Comment601	Hope to see the man child in court  happy days
Comment 601.1	@Martin Baldwin-Edwards Better still, happier days
Comment 601.2	I would like to see him (and his cohort of crooks) behind bars.
Comment602	These people are traitors to Britain.  They need to leave just like the people voted. Shame the history will show how these parliament has betrayed the people.
Comment 602.1	Those people in Parliament were voted in by the people in 2017 dickhead.
Comment603	STOP! Let us see what is happening here . The people voted for Brexit . The people appoint SERVANTS to serve the public . These servants have disobeyed the wishes of the Public who they SERVE . What madness ! Get rid of these disobedient servants !
Comment 603.1	The people voted for them in 2017 dickhead.
Comment604	BBC is biased, it did not show the speeches of Nigel Farage and Anne Widdecombe.
Comment 604.1	John Doe They are indeed the reflection of some people’s opinion. And to be fair, Farage and Tice , despite not actually having any influence over what is happening they are never off the air.
Comment 604.2	@Stevie H perhaps not, but since parliament refuses to allow a general election, they are the most recent reflection of the people&#39;s will.
Comment 604.3	Neither of which holds a seat in Parliament.
Comment605	People’s Vote = 💩💩💩
Comment606	I feel so warm and forgiving towards the mps , lol
Comment607	Another sell out like may hang um all for treason boris is just another rothchild puppit
Comment 607.1	i know many g o v workers who have changed over the years, very selfish, greedy and not worth knowing. i hear them complain about their jobs but sit it out for pension and paycheck.<br />my 8 year old grandchild hit the nail on the head, &quot;stop giving them money and they will stop doing bad things&quot;- made me think, that can only mean taxes right? can you imagine...lol
Comment608	It is against the law for politicians to upend the referendum. Jail them.
Comment609	DUDE you’ve shown at least 17.4 million people who voted OUT that you too are a TRAITOR to the democratic vote the people gave, OUT OUT OUT.
Comment 609.1	@skill centre Yep, you are.
Comment 609.2	Thick thick thick
Comment610	No Deal is the only genuine Brexit. Johnson has joined the traitors in trying to impose his version of May’s awful deal, which is a legal nightmare.
Comment 610.1	@Repulse theMonkey - you are a grooming victim.
Comment 610.2	skill centre You are either very badly informed or wilfully ignorant.
Comment 610.3	Dude - you&#39;re the traitor
Comment611	Steptoe, you and your party will never be trusted in charge of this great country, Dude you and your party are going to have the biggest fight on your hands come the General election, 17.4 million and now many more will definitely be voting for the Brexit party, NIGEL WE THE PEOPLE ARE READY.
Comment 611.1	@skill centre How is wanting to leave the dictatorship of the EU &quot;racist&quot;?
Comment 611.2	The thick racist people.
Comment612	The Peoples  Vote is really the Rothschilds Vote....sponsored by their agent George Soros.
Comment 612.1	Murdoch puppet?
Comment 612.2	Boring racist.
Comment613	Boris is a real hero. He needs support from leave voter. Those undemocratic mps are disgraceful. Both are looser only winner is all the way EU.
Comment 613.1	He&#39;s a real fool.
Comment 613.2	He&#39;s in court Monday!
Comment614	Honestly getting tired of the House of Commons. All self serving elitists of the left, making way for the far right.
Comment 614.1	There is plenty of room - in prison.
Comment615	What a total shambles of a Parliament. General election is the answer, so that we can sack these self seeking no traitors.
Comment616	BBC - British Biased Broadcasting at its best. TAKEAWAY THEIR FUNDING!!!
Comment617	Remoaning tossers.
Comment 617.1	@skill centre Try to learn what &quot;racist&quot; actually means, ya thicko.
Comment 617.2	Thick racist.
Comment618	Second referendum ,LETS GO !
Comment 618.1	@Jon Seymour are you sure we don&#39;t need one ? Because right now our policies are a mess
Comment 618.2	We already had one. We don&#39;t need another one.
Comment619	BBC is controlled by its globalist masters
Comment 619.1	And you are controlled by that hamster working the controls in your head.
Comment620	If UK fail to BREXIT; the computer controlled reality will emerge.<br />People unknowingly and covertly will be run by Beast Transhumanism Artifacial Intelligence operated computers via satellite or via 5G grids. <br />See the reply section for details how American Deepstate apply technology to control our Government and mass people by Artifacial Intelligence via satellite and make people their proxy fighters.
Comment621	THE BIASED BROADCASTING CORPORATION.
Comment622	What a childish stunt from an unfit PM who holds himself above the law.
Comment623	"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23brexit"">#brexit</a> what&#39;s the point of having a second referendum if it can simply be swept under the rug.<br />Please let the rule of law take hold and let brexit take its course."
Comment624	Now...this is really childish...stupid..What a tosser!
Comment625	You seen the tweets from remoaners to the eu pull your pants down eu kiss kiss kiss kiss lets have 4th referendum option 1 we kiss your ass eu option 2 we suck your cock
Comment 625.1	I can smell Farage&#39;s dick - is that coming from you?
Comment626	I wonder what the British would say if the EU sent such a letter. And all this for imaginary banana&#39;s
Comment627	Brexit is happening on the 31st of October. It&#39;s happening. The crooks in the way of the constitutional majority of the UK electorate are defeated and in denial. They have a final chance to vote for the deal or be faced with a no deal. Conservatives = deal.<br />Labour = reject the deal, forcing no deal.
Comment628	I despise the bbc. Homosexuals and jews
Comment 628.1	Racist loon
Comment629	Boris is simply brilliant...<br />An unsigned letter, would you believe it. An absolute blinder out of nowhere.
Comment 629.1	@skill centre Not really any grounds for Remainers to take him to court, it said for a letter to be sent, he sent one, it didn&#39;t state that it had to be signed, didn&#39;t state that more than 1 couldn&#39;t be sent to practically make the first irrelevant
Comment 629.2	Johnson is in court Monday -  An absolute blinder out of nowhere.
Comment630	It’s what they teach at Eaton when one doesn’t get ones way.........you have a school boy huff, throw your teddy bear in the corner, run to your bedroom and wait for nursie to send hot milk and biscuits
Comment 630.1	These Old Etonians are all weird freemason trannies
Comment631	Macron will not agree to another meaningless extension. The majority want out and the EU knows it. These ultra-remain extremist MPs are hated in the heartlands.
Comment632	BBC = complete propaganda
Comment 632.1	BBC reported the collapse of World Trade Centre Building 7 20 minutes before it happened.

Comment 636.1	He&#39;s in court Monday - how did it go last time?
Comment637	Why does he keep calling them friends across the water,   they are the enemy of the UNITED KINGDOM

Comment639	Oliver letwin has wrecked great Britain the EU won&#39;t give them an extention because EU law has more power because a country can veto this decision get this around your thick heads!!
Comment 639.1	@skill centre did I call you a dickhead? Was I referring to you? Can&#39;t you form a contrary position without abusing someone who hasn&#39;t said one word against you? Did I call you a dickhead when?
Comment 639.2	Says the dickhead who does not know how to use a full stop.

Comment641	People who lose  definitely do not want to honor democracy in any civil respectable way. That left with the only other option remaining, where democracy fail the result will not be pretty at all. Now pray.
Comment642	I think the people voted to leave? Why some politicians seem disrespectful to that decision?
Comment 642.1	@Jon Seymour &quot;We send the EU £350 million a week - Let&#39;s fund our NHS instead&quot; - where is the could dickhead?
Comment 642.2	@skill centre I think you don&#39;t know the difference between &quot;could&quot; and &quot;will&quot;.
Comment 642.3	Because they all bow down to their Rothschild family masters
Comment 642.4	Because the referendum was corrupt. Have you heard any mention of £350 million a week for the NHS?
Comment643	It just goes to show, laws made in undue haste and no scrutiny are generally not worth the paper they are written on. Well done Boris, stuff the remoaners. <br />Meanwhile in other news there is a severe flood warning in Westminster for today from the snoflake tears.
Comment 643.1	Johnny Rad the cultist also advertises for a political private company funded by millionaires posing as a political party.
Comment 643.2	Yaw! the &quot;snowflake&quot; insult, the call of he uneducated moron with shit for brains.
Comment644	It is the British people who decided to leave the EU. The government is only trying to deliver what the people want.
Comment 644.1	The British people were lied to and are still being lied to by Tory politicians.
Comment645	Bunch of idiots the lot of them just get on with it!!!!
Comment 645.1	@skill centre It might do. I have kids, they might see it happen before they die...or maybe not.
Comment 645.2	@skill centre don&#39;t worry from today I&#39;m not.. stay or leave I don&#39;t care as long as I don&#39;t have to listen to this B&#39;s anymore.
Comment 645.3	Forget Brexit - it&#39;s never happening,
Comment646	The Labour criminals in Parliament have hamstrung a serving Prime Minister but if hes really a leader he will deliver BREXIT on 30th October, if not hes a stooge placed by the conservatives to take the fall for their lies. It looks as though democracy has died in UK its been replaced by an elitist schoolboy club controlling the people at all costs
Comment 646.1	Watch your mouth shit head.
Comment647	Hahaha, why dont you guys cancel this Brexit stuff? 🤔🤔👀👀😁😁😁🙄🙄🙄💃💃💃💃💃
Comment 647.1	Good idea
Comment648	If we don&#39;t leave we should take the government to court for lying to the people in 2016  the people  thinking  they was leaving when they won the referendum
Comment 648.1	A similar type of referendum scam happened in Romania where over 50% of the voters voted against the president but nothing changed and he still remained in charge a couple years ago. Protests did almost nothing sadly in our case
Comment 648.2	123ldudley it was recently decided by court that politicians are allowed to lie to the voters.
Comment649	Lmfao I kneeeeeew he was gona do it. I can’t wait to see the melt down of the elites. And BBC, you’re horrible.
Comment 649.1	BBC is a disgusting satanist organisation
Comment650	Remoaners are ridiculous.  Thousands of middle class Londoners, all intent on sticking up two fingers to the rest of the country.
Comment 650.1	How many was on the last Leave march in London fella?
Comment651	Lol main problem of the UK is very CLEARLY NOW that parliament just flat out DON&#39;T WANT to leave the EU! Ahhahaha
Comment 651.1	And all those people don&#39;t forget.
Comment652	UK and US politics are so entertaining! In other countries it&#39;s just boring.
Comment 652.1	@Chris Mahoney What about Italy, France, Spain, Canada?
Comment653	Kick them out and refuse accepting pound currency at the ECB and fed and IMF. That will teach them. Then buy up London at 90% discount. Just like they did to continental dollars.
Comment654	It&#39;s not Boris Johnson how&#39;s holding this  country to ransom it&#39;s  Labour and Lib Dems and the courts we voted to come out and all they&#39;re doing is trying to stop it
Comment655	Not the end for this drama yet.  Looking forward for another 100 seasons
Comment656	Thank you for a clear and concise report Katja.
Comment657	The way BBC reports is a clear evidence that they only want to side with the remainers. No wonder why people is starting to distrust mainstream media.
Comment 657.1	@Jon Seymour should be easy to point out one lie then dickhead - over to you.
Comment 657.2	@skill centre In all of it you muppet.
Comment 657.3	Some people only like media when it&#39;s controlled by the Murdoch family ...
Comment 657.4	@skill centre just shut up ignoramus 😏😏
Comment 657.5	BBC is controlled by its Rothschild family masters.
Comment658	Typical BBC Shit. One sided slant pro Remoaner
Comment659	Soros money can be very dangerous to sovereign nations &amp; true democracy
Comment 659.1	He is only an agent of the Rothschild family
Comment660	Those losers want another public vote.... but when the result be against them for the second time, they will whine again and call for another public vote. Tsk tsk
Comment 660.1	@Maria Bianchi We can&#39;t simply vote on something again. Democracy doesn&#39;t work like that. You can&#39;t just ask for another vote simply because you lost the first one.
Comment 660.2	Ok so what if the result is the same? Why are the Brexit supporters so afraid of another referendum? If you won once <b>surely</b> the result will be the same. After all  it’s not like parliament is in shambles and because of that some previous supporters are changing their minds. Are you scared that Brexit might lose? If you’re so confident in Brexit why would you mind if we were to have another vote?
Comment661	A few thousand  remainer Londoners marching in the street conflating their show with real strength and representation of the real vast majority of the British people. Wait when the real British people have had it and do their own march. Not even the police will be able to manage them. A clean Brexit will happen so quickly.
Comment 661.1	@marc muwanga I have seen Leave cretins on Facebook - there is no restraint there! They simply don&#39;t give a damn enough. Nobody should fear half a dozen muppets losing their shit.
Comment 661.2	@skill centre yeah. Keep running your mouth. Society is still civil for now. So it gives you a false sense of strength and being untouchable. You conflate people&#39;s patience and civility in the face of the injustice you put them through for weakness and impotence. Many an uprising have stemmed off that kind of arrogance.
Comment 661.3	@marc muwanga your Brexit has been stolen three times now - and what have your &#39;people&#39; done? NOTHING! They are impotent and weak.
Comment 661.4	@skill centre doesn&#39;t matter where you come from. My point is there is an even bigger number of people who are getting fed up with elites taking them for granted and looking down on them. Those people won&#39;t be so civil in their methods when they have had it.
Comment 661.5	@marc muwanga I&#39;m from Stoke you thick idiot.
Comment662	Well Britain ever leave the EU? My GOD!!!!
Comment 662.1	Hotel California.
Comment 662.2	NO
Comment663	Insane Clown in positiins of power can be successfully resisted... unfortunately our insane clown is more boorish, loutish and criminal than yours insane clown
Comment664	it&#39;s a good thing it was voted down, but the labour party now must also be voted down. OPEN YOUR EYES BORIS!!! YOU MUST WORK WITH NIGEL FARAGE NOW.
Comment665	The remainers that don&#39;t respect referendum just because the result is not for them rejoice. Economic uncertainty will be brought by the remainers and those selfish politicians
Comment666	“POOR ‘Mop head’ NO Margaret Thatcher here folks!!!” 🔥🇬🇧🔥🇬🇧🔥🇬🇧🔥
Comment667	What a group of losers.  Defying democracy...  Corbyn is a scumbag...
Comment668	EU, give parliament no answer until the last possible hour on Oct 31.  You are not obligated to get a quick response to them especially if your members can’t come to a unanimous decision.  Parliament will be forced to vote “deal or no deal” in the final hours.....they will go for the deal.  They  are too chicken to go for no deal.  Parliament fell into BoJos trap.  The EU gains nothing with an extension.  They may even be forced to secede more than they already have.
Comment 668.1	Lol, a Brit still wants to tell the EU what they shall do? That&#39;s cute ...
Comment669	Citizen vote to out and MP vote to stay! Who actually is not democracy?
Comment 669.1	Piss off comrade.
Comment670	Let’s the ppl vote : majority votes to leave <br /><br />MPs : we don’t like this outcome so let’s act like it never happened n ask for another vote until we like the outcome <br /><br />Ppl: <b>cries in failed democracy</b>
Comment671	Brexit has become like an unendingly laborious version of Tantric Sex;  minus intimate connection and no ultimate orgasm in sight.
Comment672	Brexit supporters have jobs.
Comment 672.1	For now
Comment673	🙈I Will Not,,, Negotiate The Delay~🎃✨😬😂😂😂😂🙏🌎🐸💕🙊😘✌...
Comment674	So Boris asked EU to help him dealing with UK parliament so he can get out on 31  .  Is this a joke? He put Trump to shame on this one...
Comment 674.1	I mean its actually the opposition and the people who brought in the benn act that are betraying the country largest brexit poll to date indicates 54% of people want to leave with or without a deal. It was on jeremy vine
Comment 674.2	@Bacon Crusader he shld shut his mouth cos you dont like the truth?<br />Yup sounds like the stereotypical no deal person
Comment 674.3	Shut your mouth remainer commie!!
Comment675	Wtf is going on? Why are there protestors with &quot;hashtag PeoplesVote&quot; saying &quot;STOP BREXIT&quot;.<br />The heck? I thought the public voted to LEAVE? I&#39;m so confused. Just flippin do something.
Comment676	Worst government of dumbest of countries
Comment677	More seasons to broadcast!
Comment678	Seem&#39;s to me it is passed time the People make a stand against their oppressive government and force the government to honor the peoples vote. anyone who tries to block should be arrested for treason.plain and simple the people voted to LEAVE
Comment679	The crowds is like a world cup final
Comment680	Just incase any other European are watching this we don’t hate you but European Union is bullshit
Comment681	THANKS CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA
Comment682	<b>The reality...</b><br /><br />People voted leave for reasons that were bigoted and/or grossly uninformed.<br /><br />Now that the reality of leaving has become apparent, there is a perfectly democratic case for going back to the public, presenting the reality of leaving and the damage it will do to the union and the economy, and asking if we still want this.<br /><br />There&#39;s only one reason to be against this exercise in democracy, which is people afraid of the result.
Comment 682.1	@Yoruichi The Extra Terrestrial and what I&#39;m saying is if you have a second referendum the majority will be remain not because the will of the people has changed but because the people who choose leave before have given up on democracy and will not vote, why put your time in a system that has done everything it can to weasel its way out of a majority decision. Of course the lefties will spin it with some kind of bs like people have become &#39;enlightened&#39;  and now love the EU ignoring the huge difference between the large  number of people that voted before and the few that voted now. Then weak labour MPs will go on their hands and knees to the EU saying please can we revoke article 50. EU will say yes as long as you become full members ie give up the pound and any other independence you currently have oh and you won&#39;t be one of the top three anymore get down there with Greece so you can have even less say in the ruling of your country. Labour will jump at this not even putting it to a vote saying the second referendum justify this, even though their will be rioting in the streets. Loving the fact that the MPs can go back to being paid over £100,000 a year but not having to run a country, just copy and paste from the EU. The economy will suffer because the UK will be either be viewed as weak or unreliable so businesses will move away from trading here. Que a large depression in which another large EU country will lend the UK money same as Germany did to Greece forever keeping the UK in debt and chaining them to the Eu, then you will have a National socialist party come along which will gather momentum as people have lost faith in the current forms of government for &#39;selling us out&#39; and &#39;ignoring the peoples vote&#39;  rise to power leading to heavy censorship of the news and propaganda to brainwash the youth blaming a group for all the countries problems. This is how you get Nazi&#39;s and it all starts from the contradiction of ignoring a vote in the name of democracy
Comment 682.2	@b minus <b>1.</b> The current leader was elected, just not by people like you.<br /><br /><b>2.</b> It should be obvious that I&#39;m not referring to the small majority that voted to leave, but to the fact that many of those people have changed their minds. It&#39;s reasonable to say that since there&#39;s at the very least, that&#39;s a question over whether the will of the majority has changed now that people are now finding out what leaving means, it&#39;s entirely democratic to say &#39;this is what leaving with a deal means, this is what leaving without a deal means. Do you want either of those or would you prefer to stay&#39;?<br /><br />So far as I can see, the only reason to be against putting it back to the people is if you&#39;re scared of the result.
Comment 682.3	@Yoruichi The Extra Terrestrial 1) the last general election was June 2017 our current leadership was not elected 2) as you just said it&#39;s undemocratic not to listen to the will of the people, and the 17.4 million people voted to leave, but you are suggesting to ignore that and have another vote in hopes of having a result more suited to your opinion That would be a sham democracy that is used dictators, I stand by my choice of words
Comment 682.4	@b minus If it&#39;s clear that the will of people has changed and it is still possible to reverse the decision, it&#39;s undemocratic to ignore the will of the people.<br /><br />Either way, it is certainly not dictatorship. I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re throwing that word around since it would mean only one person or one very small group of people decide what happens and they&#39;re wouldn&#39;t have been a referendum in the first place or elected representatives debating whether the decision should stand or whether the final decision should be made by the people.<br /><br />Dictatorship is nowhere to be found in the current situation.
Comment 682.5	If you don&#39;t enact the results of the first vote, you don&#39;t have a democracy. You have a dictatorship that picks and chooses    what is best for the leadership thinly veiled as the &#39;will of the people&#39;
Comment683	I’m so relieved he’s not signing it. We really can’t afford for another extension now.
Comment684	"almost unbiased but not quite BBC <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bias"">#Bias</a> Broadcasting Corporation"
Comment685	STOP - The EU have 3 deals on the table. Boris deal, Teresa deal and No deal. I urge EU to respond to Parliament with a simple -  make your mind up - there will be no more deals,  no more extensions, vote on the 3 deals and leave on 31st October. We have more important things to do.
Comment 685.1	4 deals actually - we are going to keep the one we have now thanks.
Comment686	Lol I love how he sidestepped the law 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Comment 686.1	@cheeky monkey <br />Actually no-one typed the letter at all. Boris just sent a photocopy of the letter that had been included in the Benn Act. So I doubt it was on government stationery. Quite funny really.
Comment 686.2	He didn&#39;t sidestep it. It would have been on UK government stationary. In other words &quot;from Her Majesty&#39;s government&quot; of which Boris is the Prime Minister. So he has, by representation, signed it.
Comment687	Remainers totally blaming Boris and totally disregarding the referendum result ...
Comment 687.1	Because lies and lawbreaking.
Comment688	Isn&#39;t Boris wonderful ?      After all he got away with breaking Electoral Law in 2016 .   He is our saviour ???
Comment 688.1	@California Dreamin&#39; unfortunately, the UK has brought shame on itself. Out there we have fellow cirizens who voted these people in. It makes me ashamed to be part of it. If I could leave, I think I would.
Comment 688.2	Wendy Follett              The letter to the EU business  has brought SHAME on the United Kingdom.   It also yet again raises the issue of his, Boris, trustworthiness......and his government propose to negotiate fantastic new deals throughout the world !!    Their policy is lunacy and the country will pay for it....again.
Comment 688.3	I believe this is now his third attempt to break the law. Illegal referendum shenanigans. Unlawful prorogueing. Attempting to frustrate the will of parliament.
Comment689	I predict that the EU will refuse to give an extension thereby forcing the UK parliament to vote for the deal.
Comment 689.1	@skill centre - interesting. I guess they could have a vote to do so - not sure if it would pass.
Comment 689.2	@Wendy Follett I guess we will see...
Comment 689.3	@James Neilson Graham Yes - and the only way out is...?
Comment 689.4	@James Neilson Graham More willy than nilly
Comment 689.5	Steven Austin,  Boris&#39;s actions (not signing the letter) put the EU in a fix. Do they, as you suggest, side with Boris or do they side with parliament? They have been dragged, willy nilly, into British politics . . .
Comment690	Finally parliament is showing its true colors. Having betrayed its &#39;leave&#39; voters they are now openly support their true supporters-the economic elite that want to stay. The same elite that funds their re-elections. They then vote their own laws into effect technically making Brexit illegal. This is based on their preferences rather than the people referendums results. There will be a civil war in Britain if this is allowed.
Comment691	Brexit bas to be stopped,
Comment 691.1	Nope, the majority voted to leave. Only traitors would ever try to go against the will of the people.
Comment692	So, a second referendum is undemocratic in the opinion of the Brexteers. I suspect that General Elections, which are repeated every four years, are also undemocratic, right?<br />Or does it depend on the length of time between two elections, whether an election is democratic?
Comment 692.1	We had a referendum, why do you want a losers vote?
Comment693	Just do another bloody referendum and get it over with. Heck I&#39;ll even write the question for you.<br /><br />&quot;Should the United Kingdom leave the European Union with the current deal or remain in the European Union?&quot;<br />a. Leave the European Union with the current deal<br />b. Remain in the European Union
Comment694	Look how aggressive these “ peaceful remainers“ protests are !! If this was Brexit protest doing this the police brutality would be horrendous and the bbc news would be reporting about it. Bout time us brexiteers caused carnage and let them know with force we mean buisness
Comment 694.1	@skill centre I was on that March.  There were at least 100,000 people but it was reported as 5,000 by the Rothschild media.  None of the marchers were arrested.
Comment 694.2	There were no arrests today. The last Leaver march there were only 5,000 Leavers and 17 arrests.
Comment695	I think they should play comedial music at the start of every parliamentary session. I propose the intro from the 1981 comedy SOAP. Perfect music for these jesters and clowns... What say you? The aye&#39;s have it? Order!.... Order!... I said f#@$ing Order!!!
Comment 695.1	Yakity Sax (Benny Hill theme tune)
Comment696	BORIS UNELECTED JOHNSON IS NOW A LAW BREAKER. LOCK HIM UP!
Comment 696.1	@Peregrine Slim <br /><br />He sent the letter as he was advised to do but there wasn&#39;t a stipulation in the Benn Act that states that he should sign it.<br />Unless you can point out to me where it is?<br />As for the referendum being advisory, yes it was but article 50 was invoked by a majority in the house. If it&#39;s so easy why don&#39;t you petition your MP to revoke article 50? It probably wouldn&#39;t be a good idea though because even the staunch remainers know they haven&#39;t got the numbers to push that one through.<br />Boris is elected because he&#39;s an MP and as I said earlier if you have problems with Boris being an unelected Prime Minister then again I&#39;d advise you to petition your MP to push for a general election.<br />And remind me again who was the Prime Minister who allowed the referendum in the first place, it wasn&#39;t Johnson and you&#39;ll find that that Prime Minister was elected.
Comment 696.2	@Ford Torino There was nothing &#39;related&#39; about it, and the fact he is unelected means also that a quasi-referendum is also simply advisory.
Comment 696.3	What law has he broken?<br />The Benn Bill stated that the Prime Minister had to send the letter relating to the extension if a deal hadn&#39;t been passed by 19/10/19 which he has done.<br />As for him being unelected?<br />That also applies to Major, Brown and May who all assumed office without an election.<br />Also, it might have slipped your mind but Johnson asked parliament twice for an election but was turned down by Labour, the LibDems and the SNP amongst others.
Comment697	1 million people marching thats laughable, more like 25 thousand and thats being kind.
Comment 697.1	Diane Abbott was on counting duty today.
Comment 697.2	Mart Wheat<br />Who or what the fuck are you?<br />A bullshitter.<br /><br />Oh.<br /><br /><br />OK.
Comment698	Shit!.. workin on a Saturday! Hard day for the elites. Hope they dont have to do that too often.
Comment699	Better cut Prince Andrew loose if England to retain any monetary exchange respect. The Sterling Pound about to turn into cheap tin pretending Royals are above The Law and common decency (pals of Trump &amp; Epstein will always be those to slough off and cut out).
Comment700	The blackmailing treasonous remainer MP&#39;s calling the PM a blackmailer???? The pot calling the kettle black!
Comment701	General election = crushing defeat for labour Lib Dem traitors who go against those who you represent this election is gonna be the end of labour
Comment702	shit stay or go  you voted to go then go shit
Comment703	Traitors - out by October 31st NO DELAYS
Comment704	I wish I could keep delaying my homework submission date
Comment705	This is the problem with democracy, it allows uneducated people an opinion on issues, they haven’t got clue about... should never have had a referendum. All those crying for a Brexit, are the ones that will suffer the most...  but hey just like Trump supporters it’s a cult following..
Comment 705.1	The reasons why many of the leavers voted in favour of Brexit have nothing to do with the EU. And if you followed the documentaries about Brexit you certainly may have noticed that many of these people admitted that their main goal was simply to annoy the &quot;elite&quot; and all others whom they held accountable for their miserable life.<br />These Brexiteers have the mindset of suicide bombers. They don&#39;t care if the harm themselves as long as they can harm the ones they hate.
Comment706	If he didn&#39;t sign the letter does that mean technically he&#39;s stuck 2 fingers up at the EU
Comment 706.1	James Neilson Graham you mean lawmakers.
Comment 706.2	I think it means he&#39;s stuck two fingers up at parliament . . .
Comment 706.3	Dave Thomas more like sticking those fingers to british law.
Comment707	So Brexit is being renewed for a new season? Ditto.
Comment708	The remoaners  aren’t so smart as they think, they requested a letter to be sent not signed .well done Boris you didn’t break the law .Tge traitors day is coming
Comment 708.1	@Wendy Follett The Benn law is illegal. So your argument is moot.
Comment 708.2	@Hamish Somerville actually by not signing and sending his childish cover notes, he has broken the law! But whether anyone will bother attempting to do anything about that depends on how serious the consequences of his childish behaviour are.
Comment 708.3	"Take it your a remoaner that didn’t get off you ass to vote in the <a href=""http://referendum.no/"">referendum.No</a> law was broken as I said he was asked to send a letter not sign a signed letter .Suck it up"
Comment 708.4	Hamish Somerville<br />So you don&#39;t respect the law of the land, including The Benn Law.<br />Off with your head!<br />It&#39;s not doing much for you as it is.
Comment709	Only immigrants were protesting to stay in the EU
Comment 709.1	Eugene Spicer<br />At this stage why  the fuck would anyone want to come  to a little shit hole country like Britain to do the jobs that English are too lazy and too full of themselves to do?<br />Guess in future you&#39;ll have to go outside the EU to get wage slaves to pick your fruit and veg and man whatever is left of your factories.
Comment710	What a farce
Comment711	Right, so johnson has broken the law.  There is a legal precedent (Padfield) that makes it illegal for any minister of the crown to frustrate the intention of an act of parliament.
Comment712	What a bunch of clowns!  First they don’t want a no deal...then with a deal..they can’t make up their minds..... how many more years will these clowns keep democracy down. The people chose 3 years ago! It’s like the democrats here in America who cant believe a non Politician won the presidency by the voters and have been on a witch hunt since and getting nothing done in Congress. The labor and democratic parties are fraud...democracy is fading..
Comment713	As goes Trump so goes Boris.
Comment714	"The reports are saying that the PM sent an unsigned letter in the form required by Parliament. BBC NEWS: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xhny-VF4-Y"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xhny-VF4-Y</a><br />Then the PM sent a second letter explaining the first letter was from Parliament. He then sent a third letter stating that the government was not requesting an extension. In international law, only the third letter has legal force under the EU Treaty.<br />The EU Treaty, like all treaties, is governed by the Vienna Convention, the treaty on treaties. Under the Vienna Convention, the government, not Parliament, is the authorized representative of the UK. Thus, the UK Supreme Court may state next week that the PM must comply with UK law, but that will have no effect in international law. The third letter from the PM determines the UK&#39;s legal position on Brexit: the UK does not request an extension beyond October 31. The Vienna Convention also provides that, if the UK&#39;s representative is forced by threats, any agreement under a treaty is null and void.<br />The International Court of Justice has jurisdiction, not the EU courts."
Comment715	He actually sent the extension letter WITHOUT an signature?! LMAOOOO...you gotta love it. This is crazy
Comment 715.1	@Daniel Cowell How do you get that it was un-democratic? it was voted on by the representatives of the people of the UK. It was VERY democratic, although not direct democracy...Johnson does not want direct democracy or he would allow a second referendum now that he has a deal, and the people are more educated on the subject!
Comment 715.2	He can&#39;t do joined-up writing, and he thought that if he used his favourite blue crayon and capitals everyone would know
Comment 715.3	Yes coz only Boris is allowed to call people nazi, fascist, marxist , chlorinated chicken, letterboxes , etc
Comment 715.4	@Skylie Skye Boris is in no way similar to Hitler, you people should be ashamed of yourselves, you are trivializing the true horrors of fascism by comparing everything you disagree with as Fascist or Nazi. Just Fuck off with that rhetoric, we are sick of you people labeling everything and trying to shut down all conversation with this crap. When you need to resort to insults and call into question people&#39;s character you have lost the argument, you should be able to argue your point in a coherent and sensible manner the reason you can&#39;t is because you know that you are wrong and cannot organise your thoughts in a manner that makes sense of what you think is true. If you think Boris &amp; Trump are bad then you have no idea what is coming, if the left within the western world does not come back to the centre you may very well end up creating the new Hitler, or the new Stalin if they aren&#39;t pulled back to the middle. you are already seeing the beginning of the people&#39;s discontent in the form of Brexit and the populist governments springing up all over the western world and it&#39;s only going to get worse.
Comment 715.5	@Skylie Skye I think you shouldn&#39;t compare boris with a person that murdered and committed genocide on the highest order plus i think 17.4 million should be honoured and were  going out with out a deal and it will be the remainers fault for not voting for a deal which is what people want
Comment716	FUCK OFF GANGSTALKERS THAILAND
Comment717	I&#39;m from Australia and I can&#39;t believe that the UK parliament is actively working against the wishes of its citizens  ... they should be hung for treason ... maybe that day is closer than we think.
Comment 717.1	@John Smith you don&#39;t know f*ck all about me me dickhead.
Comment 717.2	@skill centre I can tell from your language and attitude that you don&#39;t mind bending over for UNELECTED bureaucrats from another country  ... a referendum is at least carried out for and by citizens. <br /><br />Just because you don&#39;t like the democratic outcome doesn&#39;t make it a lie ... it just means you didn&#39;t get your way and your response is like a child throwing your toys out of the cot and a big dummy spit.<br /><br />Hope mum changed your diapers, because I can smell you from here.
Comment 717.3	Keep your gob shut Aussie - the referendum was full off lies and lawbreaking and even then it was close. Being British means playing fair - so the vote is meaningless.
Comment 717.4	@John Smith I agree dear cousin ,  but just a New election won&#39;t change anything , the corrupt system Will Always be the same , I would say the system started around 1980&#39;s . But i fear only a violent revolution could change things
Comment 717.5	@d drid Lobbyists should be banned in all democracies  ... corruption can only follow.
Comment718	ourderrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Comment719	EU flags on the streets of London is an uncomfortable site
Comment 719.1	Jim Rogers Ok...... spelling police 👍 it’s a quick written message to numpty s that STILL,  three years later can’t get over that they lost. I’ve been brought up, that then when you have a disappointments in life, what you do is...... “PICK YOUR SELF UP” ....... “ DUST YOUR SELF DOWN” ....... “ AND START AGAIN “ .....NOT CRY FOR THREE YEARS LIKE YPU LEFTIES DO” 😂 my mother and father ran a successful business for 30 years 😁,  I have a job that I love and my wife of eleven years is a school teacher 😁 so I’m just doing just dddddddaaaaaammmmmm fine thank you 😁👍
Comment 719.2	Ex Essex.... that’s so funny, there my middle names 😂😂  after my mother’s two brothers, 🤔 so you don’t know my first name or my surname....... however 🤔... a couple of names springs to mind with you...... a  numpty losing lefty 👍
Comment 719.3	Flags and jingoism serve no one well. However leaving the EU will not improve you education and you will continue to misspell. Do you seriously believe that little Britain can go it alone in the world . It will be sad to see the UK slowly decline further into the sewer. The harm that this silly idea of Brexit will do to  Scotland, and to her other neighbour, Ireland,  only be surpassed by the internal economic decline of GB.
Comment 719.4	@Mark James  You must be some sad loser Latin-Hebrew mongrel with a name like that. Pretending to be a pure bred Anglo-Saxon/Aryan are you? Wikipedia: JAMES is a masculine given name, a modern descendant of Iacobus, the Latin form of the Hebrew name Jacob. MARK is a common male given name and is derived from old Latin &quot;Mart-kos&quot;.
Comment 719.5	Finn MickCool..... and you must be a sad losing paddy, with a name like that, also I’d LOVE it if the EU said no to extension and we ended going out on no deal..... now that would be funny 😁
Comment720	The protests in Hong Kong are not “Pro-Democracy”, they are violent rioters that will beat up ordinary residents of different views from them. Free HongKong from these violent rioters and return Hong Kong to pre-June-2019 where everywhere are peaceful！
Comment721	orderrrrrrrrrrrrr orderrrrrrrrrrrrr
Comment722	Good old delusional BBC giving consequence to these room temperature IQ protesters that don`t know how referendums work!
Comment 722.1	@Deano Carden so we should abide by referendum result of the 1970s?
Comment 722.2	@Jon Seymour hahahahaha! I work in care of the elderly. I&#39;ve been run over by them many times. What&#39;s up? Got no sense of humour??
Comment 722.3	@Wendy Follett Nasty ignorant bigoted comment.
Comment 722.4	Fortunately you cant have another referendum(as you cant just change the result as the losers couldnt take defeat 🤣)so we should all be safe 😀 phew 😆
Comment 722.5	@Deano Carden yeah! All those old folk on their scooters are bloody dangerous!
Comment723	BREXIT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!💪💪🙏
Comment 723.1	@Abi Extocapan Agreed - 980 years is a bit too soon now you mention it.
Comment 723.2	That is pretty soon@skill centre !!!
Comment 723.3	How about 2999
Comment724	I&#39;m sick to fuckin death of extensions,all the MP s who voted against Brexit should not get re elected at the next general election,time for riots if we don&#39;t get out on the 31st
Comment 724.1	STFU you loon - no prizes for guessing you voted for Brexit
Comment725	Watching on in embarrassment from the US.<br /><br />Further to this, most of these remain folks who couldn’t be bothered to get out of bed to vote in the first place , have no idea what they are actually marching for.
Comment 725.1	In a democracy they should get a second referendum....in twenty years
Comment 725.2	Yvonne McLay Take it you are  on their side then? British people are hypocrites and can be swayed with the wind. These protesters represent 1% of the population. England is still a very racist and prejudiced country also.
Comment 725.3	Tyrone Power bullshit, they’re more politically aware than all the buffoons in the USA
Comment726	Labour are done now talk about sell outs is so laughable its all a charade in parliament against the 17.4 m who voted to leave im not a tory either democracy has died in britain mp s are self serving and have interests in europe  a lot through there own business interests  they dont realise the 17.4 million will rise
Comment727	EU: get rid of Britain now!
Comment728	The best way right now is to hope for EU to expel UK. Both sides will be happy
Comment729	The REMAIN snakes aka NAZIS hate DEMOCRACY and have betrayed the British people. 23/06/16.
Comment 729.1	Calvary Crusader<br />Did they bite you on the ass without puking or dying? <br />And yet you&#39;re still here spewing venom or bile.<br />This must be called a difference of opinion.
Comment730	bless those people for marching for what they believe in. &lt;3
Comment731	Never vote for a deal that has yet to be confirmed,why did the erg vote for it,to scupper it before the 31 October making leaving without a deal, anybody that believes boris and any word he says Is silly
Comment732	This whole fiasco is sooooo 2019
Comment 732.1	Jack Frost still watching in 2027🤣
Comment733	Partition England. It’s the only solution.
Comment 733.1	Declare  Marshall law.
Comment 733.2	I agree
Comment734	All that screaming in the background of the house parliament, it sounds like HELL
Comment 734.1	ybbok - as the moronic tusk said &quot; there is a special place in hell.......&quot; was he referring to the hell in our house of commons or the house of lords! Frankly if you ask me the latter should be disbanded &amp; the former needs a thorough sanitising, march out the germanic nazi collaborators to Tower of london to be executed. All future candidates who are going to represent the British people should be scrutinised &amp; undergo an extensive police screening &amp; and a MI6 Intelligence clearance. These measures will reduce or cut out all the dead wood, bad apples, double agents, self serving political profiteers. After we have left the germanic eu bable juggernaut. They should introduce a bill to bring the death penalty only for treason, collaboration &amp; collution  with a foreign nation. His is to be called &quot; Hanging by Big Ben&quot;
Comment 734.2	@Martin Baldwin-Edwards Not wrong!
Comment 734.3	That&#39;s because the UK is a modern Hell, these days.
Comment735	But the question everyone still wants answered is: When is Parliament being sacked and when are more powers being restored to the Monarchy ?
Comment 735.1	Would probably have more respect for the public.
Comment 735.2	I was being sarcastic , monarchy must be abolished
Comment 735.3	The monarchy is as usefull as a chicken in a vegan store 😂😂😂
Comment 735.4	@Finn MickCool How about we put this to a vote instead you soap-dodger?
Comment736	Brexit delay tell the EU stick it in their ass.
Comment737	Eu can go and jump in the lake and so can labour
Comment 737.1	EU isn&#39;t going anywhere. UK want&#39;s to go, but bolted itself to the ground. Great strategie.
Comment738	Britan has been an important player in the EU and her place is definitely in the EU. I hope things work out for the British.
Comment739	please, the situation it&#39;s complicated in Chile, help us, our government is getting us in a situation that we can not tolerate anymore, make the difference and help us spreading this information, our future is in your hands.
Comment740	Leave with a no deal ffs and get it done can’t leave with a deal can’t leave with so stand up for democracy and leave on wto terms
Comment 740.1	dale chapman        This country is so lucky you only get one vote.
Comment 740.2	Or don&#39;t leave at all = what most of the country wants.
Comment741	EU rules us due to the traitors johnson sold us out
Comment742	We aspect a peaceful election.
Comment743	May&#39;s deal was so much better. Boris is like a person writing exam copying from someone and somehow wanting more marks than the one he&#39;s copying from
Comment 743.1	And he got only defeated by 16 so he even got better marks. How?
Comment744	Jeremy Corbyn can be the next PM. Are you guys agree??? If conservative lost in general election??
Comment 744.1	Someone who is that incompetent in leading the opposition should not lead the government. Can&#39;t you get rid of both and find someone usefull for once?
Comment745	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xhny-VF4-Y&amp;t=7m00s"">7:00</a><br />That&#39;s disgusting reporting. Implying that Ministers required police escort because they forced a delay while full well knowing that it was a pro EU protest is just blatant lying.<br />BBC, you have me choking on bile. You have completely abandoned your responsibility to accurately and honestly inform the public."
Comment 745.1	Don&#39;t pay your license, you shouldn&#39;t be forced to pay for propaganda and lies.
Comment 745.2	Then stop paying the damn licence fee then dip shit
Comment 745.3	Did you not see the dude harassing Diane Abbot?
Comment746	Can Boris makes it happen or not? It&#39;s a big deal.
Comment747	STOP 🛑 BREXIT!
Comment 747.1	So BREXTOP then?
Comment748	Must the deal happen before leaving the EU is it not possible to leave the EU like the majority of people wanted and then start devising a deal? Leave the EU now, have a general election then the new majority government can work on a deal for however long they want to   without damaging the countries undemocratic reputation
Comment749	EU should grant an extension of &quot;one second&quot;
Comment 749.1	Best comment in 2019..
Comment 749.2	@dgr8oneme It will change your outlook if you do. It really surprised me and was unsettling as well...<br /><br />Also<br />Google: dr William pierce archive
Comment 749.3	@Oscar Burner sure, will do
Comment 749.4	Google: Europa the last battle archive<br /><br />Time to wake up. Watch the 12 hour documentary
Comment750	Just end this brexit and remain
Comment 750.1	Just end the losers and Leave.
Comment751	People. It is time to wake up and learn the truth of the modern world and ts multiple messes.<br />Google: Europa the last battle archive<br /><br /><br />Good luck!
Comment752	100 years later: Are we out of the EU yet?
Comment 752.1	100yrs since Liberals won no.10.<br />I think we can relax.<br />A lidl.
Comment 752.2	Johnson can show empathy..
Comment 752.3	@looes74 looes74   When&#39;s the kosha   Queen&#39;s Speech?.<br />  Corbyn needs to put on a tie. Trim his beard.<br />Oh; he has.
Comment 752.4	@MR WENDEL   Scotland is pretty nice actually.<br />And us Scots.<br />Need a Scotch.<br />Expensive.
Comment753	Do I need to pay for this?
Comment754	For goodness sake don&#39;t give them an extension. The UK was always the pooch of the US, let it leave, it was destined to be a tax avoider&#39;s paradise.<br /><br /><br />Let.<br />Them.<br />Go.
Comment755	The silent majority still have to roar and when they do the walls of Jericho will definitely come down.
Comment756	Corbyn said they won&#39;t be blackmailed, seriously? It is the mps who are blackmailing government and the 17.4million people.
Comment757	Tories have once again successfully managed to conn the British people by pretending they can deliver a Nigel Farage brexit
Comment758	They went through this in Canada for 33  years over Quebec separatism until they pasted the Clarity Act which provided for a long consultative process and ruled out this idea of a fudged half in half out sovereignty-association as being what &quot;leave&quot; means.  It also reserves to parliament the decision as to whether a thin majority is enough to support such a profound change.
Comment759	By far the biggest con trick this corrupt tory shambles has played on the UK.!!
Comment760	Well done Boris.
Comment761	Trumps Mother is Scottish
Comment762	A minister may not, under UK law intentionally seek a result that goes against the express intent of a law passed by Parliament. Sending a second letter to undermine the one required by the Ben Act does exactly that and is therefore illegal
Comment763	27 member states have to agree an extension. 1 adverse vote means no extension, And its corbyns fault if a no deal election occurs. Looking forward to him been pummelled at the ballot box
Comment 763.1	@Nobby Headsthats right fella I am actually British and have contributed since 1982 until 2017 to my UK pension fund i.e. paid my taxes, NHS and the like..... I have a United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland passport......I had a dark blue one aswell before these purple ones! I was born in Kingston Upon Thames London.... so you can not say that  I am foreign fella? The thing that makes me laugh is everyone is mixed like a good cocktail no one is pure we all have different type of heritage, i.e. I have Norman blood hence the surname Squire..... I have Jewish, Spanish, North African, Irish, Welsh and Scots blood in my life line, so when people start harping on about foreign, that is pure rubbish, if you are pure that means you have disabilities the same gene pool.... look at the British Royal family, they have had to go and get new genes into their systems....<br /><br /><br />Regarding your business you will not have an option than to open a European subsidary likeiwse the EU companies will have to do the same to carry on trading with the UK, FULL STOP......<br /><br /><br />Thanks for comment and great to chat with you Nobby, good luck and all the best, if you dont evolve you will not grow, thats my advice for the day...
Comment 763.2	Freddy Squire Naranjo People aren&#39;t jealous of you for being foreign.. They are jealous because you have money!<br />I used to live on a council estate and started a business, started making money and the people around me thought it was only fair I shared and helped them get out of situations of their own making (drug debts mainly..). They soon turned against me when I told them to &quot;get a job&quot;. <br />They are now on Facebook sharing &#39;patriot&#39; memes and talking about how they are kept poor by people like me..<br />The biggest problem for me is I have European exclusivity on a couple of products atm. I won&#39;t soon, unless I move... I love England.. It&#39;s my motherland but it&#39;s turning into the sort of mother who deserves her kids taking off her. :/
Comment 763.3	"@Freddy Squire Naranjo cool story fella. Seems like you got a fuck load of time on your hands. <br /><br />You debate was want ?? You don&#39;t like an OPPOSITION leader. Your Spanish and English so none of it matters to you. But you have the option of applying for a passport you clever boy. I assumed nothing other than what you had put in your essay. You own property and are Spanish so why wouldn&#39;t you have <a href=""http://or.be/"">or.be</a> able to get a passport. <br /><br />If we leave with no deal I lose my right <a href=""http://to.living/"">to.living</a> in Europe which I do. And I&#39;ll.have you know I&#39;m actually very interesting and lead a very exciting life. <br /><br />But there you go assuming shit Miguel"
Comment 763.4	@Caméron Jàmes  what a very polite person that you are, a typical brute that has no debating experience the only way is by insulting people, what a sad individual you are! <br />Regarding Spain and UK I can come and go as I PLEASE! It is called freedom of movement! There we go JEALOUSY as per normal!!! Its our devine right to go and get want you want out of life, I actually have a UK limited company at the moment and I CAN WORK WHEN, WHERE I LIKE...... I am so glad that you enjoyed my story, I bet it is more stimulating than the one you have currently!!!! <br /><br /><br />Oh by the way I do not hold a Spanish passport, only a British one, so once again you are assuming! Do not ASSUME, it makes an ASS and of U and Me......Especially U....... LOL.... <br /><br /><br />Another insecure person that thinks its their God Given Right, to insult and be rude to their fellow human beings.... Yes we do get sun in Spain and we also get the rain and the wind and the snow..... would you believe...... <br /><br /><br />I am currently in London and its cloudy and 11c..... I work all over Euope and again its my choice, that is what life is all about, its about choices you make throughout you life!! <br /><br /><br />No one is going to tell me how I live my life..... especially someone like you fella.... ROFL
Comment 763.5	Tristan Cowen You might want to go back and actually read what happened, since it was the hardcore Conservative party leavers that demanded the backstop be removed. Had they not done so, Mays deal would have passed due to her agreement with the DUP. Amazing what you can figure out when you have skills like understanding basic maths, isn&#39;t it?
Comment764	What a rude, ignorant and law breaking PM who wouldn&#39;t even sign the extension request.
Comment765	Parliament is not fit for purpose. It stops democracy and progress.
Comment 765.1	Did the nasty parliament do something you disagree with? Diddums.
Comment766	l&#39;Europe s&#39;amuse : on y entre et on en sort. Pour faire quoi, utiliser son drapeau à une fin électorale ? Le Tout ne sortez pas du Commonwealth. Europe is having fun: we go in and out. To do what, use his flag for an electoral purpose? The Whole does not leave the Commonwealth.
Comment767	We had the peoples vote. We voted to leave. There will never be an agreement on any deal so no deal is the only option.
Comment 767.1	Doug Rutter<br />Whine, whine, whine.<br />You may be waving the forlorn little cross of St. George in the wind.<br />Go piss into it as well,it needs all the help it can get.
Comment 767.2	You&#39;d have no choice, if you don&#39;t solve this, the WTO countries raise a stink about it. And if you want to do trade deals with them they don&#39;t want to see you getting unfair advantages via the backdoor
Comment768	The &quot;billionaires Brexit&quot; well said for the few not the many
Comment769	Once upon a time, if you voted against someone like Obama or Tony Blair in Britain, you simply accepted your loss and moved on. <br />Those days are indeed properly for story books which begin – “Once Upon a Time.” <br /><br />This is not something which is unique to Britain. <br />We are beginning to see the collapse of civilization which will only end in separatist movements and violence.<br />People are no longer willing to accept democracy. <br />If they lose, they are turning much more violent demanding their way or no way. <br /><br />Pro-BREXIT British MPs had to be escorted from Parliament by police to protect them from violence. Despite the fact that the people voted for BREXIT, the opposition REFUSES to accept that decision.<br /><br />We are witnessing plain intolerance rising on a massive scale. <br /><br />Democracy is dead.<br /><br />We have protests rising around the globe against the status quo. It is both sides of the political issues. <br />In Maryland, USA there was a sign posted that said:<br /> “Hey Liberals Better get your guns if you try to impeach President Trump.” <br /><br />There is simply a real hatred that is brewing and like the genie in a bottle, there is no way to put it all back. <br />This simply has to play itself out and it will NOT END WELL!!! <br /><br />Neither side is going to convince the other that their way of thinking should prevail.<br /><br />The very purpose of civilization is when everyone comes together to produce a society that is greater than the sum of the individuals. <br />We have lost that very purpose. <br /><br />I honestly do not know what the future will bring but there will have to be a lot of blood spilled before there will ever be any resolution. <br />The hatred is far too great to overcome.
Comment 769.1	Nothing like a civil war to help you through years of depression, lovely something to look forward to.
Comment 769.2	You should watch The Great Hack on netflix
Comment770	Brexiteers, we need to give up. Democracy is all but dead. Time to move on I&#39;m afraid and let the minority get their way. I will never vote again.
Comment771	We want a extension and a referendum
Comment772	Go Boris, Go Boris!   Let the GE wipe Labour out of the map.  These anti-authority and unlawful subversives are undermining the UK.  Follow the lawX Boris and use it to legally Brexit
Comment773	Steve the shouter  will b out of  a job thats why he wants an extension  total joke by lefties
Comment774	Now ENTIRE WORLD   is interested in TRADE TALKS between UK &amp; EU♒♒♒♒♒♒<br /><br />WORLD&#39;S TOP  AGENDA  is to understand  UNITED KINGDOM BUSINESS OPPORTUNIETIES &amp; ENTIRE EUROPEAN UNION BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES  from GERMANY to FRANCE to ITALY to many many countries block of 29 countries to understand POPULATION &amp; INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES  FOR ENTIRE WORLD  AVAILABLE  IN THIS PART OF  EARTH  with more WELL RDUCATED &amp; SENSITIVE  POLITIANS/BURESUCRATS/SPACE AGENCIES/MILITARY BUREAUCRATS &amp; TROOPS/INDUSTRIALISTS &amp; BUSINESS WORLD &amp; HOSPITALITY &amp; PHARMACEUTICAL HEALTH CARE to AUTOMOBILES to WELL DEVELOPED  STOCK MARKET REGULATIONS(REGULATED GUIDELINES) towards EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN +with CASH CURRENCY MARKETS  for entire WORLD.<br /><br />NO SPORTS EVENT  or  MUSIC FESTIVAL  has ever  generated so much in-depth  BUSINESS  INTEREST  IN EUROPE  &amp; UK  in Past.
Comment775	A bunch of politicians with a plan what they don’t know what to do !   Hahhahaa.  As the British song say so : “show must go on “(-Queen )
Comment776	Maybe we will get the No Deal on 31st? It&#39;s OK I&#39;m only dreaming.
Comment 776.1	PHIL MITCHELL<br />It&#39;s ok Sally.<br />Wake up.<br />It&#39;s only a nightmare.<br />C&#39;mere.I&#39;ll give you a hug.
Comment777	Still  A Crap deal but its better than Treason May&#39;s.
Comment 777.1	@Joe shmoe Well maybe i&#39;m mistaken, but how i understand it, it keeps Northern Ireland more aligned with the EU. That&#39;s why you need checks in the irish sea to make sure nothing can cross over to mainland britain from the eu or the other way arround.<br />So it is better in the question of the good friday agreement, since there is no boarder in Ireland.<br />It is worse if you wanted a clean cut from the EU, since this deal ties NI to the EU while seperating it from the rest of britain.
Comment 777.2	@Gnarlf I&#39;m not aware it did mate. If it does ignore what I said,I heard everybody say Boris&#39;s deal was a little better.
Comment 777.3	@Joe shmoe Ok i can respect that.<br />I just don&#39;t understand how a break that leaves the Uk even more connected than Mays deal, can then be in any way considered &quot;better&quot;
Comment 777.4	@Gnarlf I want a clean break pal.<br />Its what I believed I was voting for.When they said &#39;try and get a deal&#39; I didnt think they meant &#39;stay in all but name&#39;.<br /> Never gat anywhere unless we clean break then talk. Thats just business.
Comment 777.5	It is the same deal, with the exception that NI kind of stays in the EUs market.<br />(which is probably a great way to fasten the reunification of ireland, and fules the fire under another Scottish indipendence referendum)<br /><br />If it is better to stay, then would would someone want the rest of the UK to leave at all?<br />Or are you against all Unions not just the european ones and want to break up the UK?<br />In that case this deal is just great.
Comment778	Fight for freedom! Stand with Scotland!
Comment779	Daddy, please tell mommy to reconsider.
Comment780	Parliament is a joke! Corbyn and labour are a joke, SNP is a joke, Swinson and the anti democrats are a joke, BBC is a joke and a large part of the Tory party are a joke! Sadly not at all funny, they herald an act which goes against the democratic will of the people whilst condemning the priminister for not wanting to kick the can down the road. They oppose the PM because they want to overturn democracy and make us vote again. The only option that demonstrates any form of democracy is no deal as none of the proposed deals actually mean leaving the EU which we voted to do fair and square! The BBC has never been impartial and should stop pretending, that idiot in background shouting stop Brexit is totally unacceptable, as the main license demanding organisation done through legality they need to be more fair and less subliminal and propogandist! My only hope is that this causes such a backlash that people in a general election are like me swayed to the Brexit party and the Tories are forced to do a deal and we leave properly otherwise it&#39;ll be the biggest sellout of democracy in history.
Comment781	Is the Opposition opposing for opposing&#39;s sake?
Comment 781.1	Today an amendment was passed that said:<br />&quot;We can take that deal, if we are able to pass the neccessary legislation first&quot; right?<br />It is like:<br />&quot;You can have this super fancy sports car, if you promise to use the seatbelt and abide traffic rules&quot;<br />HOW DARE THEY, trying to make sure the goverment keeps its promises.
Comment782	Disgraceful actions of the pro EU London middle classes: threatening and intimidating.
Comment 782.1	I&#39;m sure the quitlings conduct themselves in far better manner.
Comment783	What will the Brexit wreckers do if the EU refuse a further  extension? I bet they&#39;ll be begging Boris to bring his deal back then.
Comment784	Let the meltdown begin 😜
Comment785	This &quot;news&quot; video is biased and anti Brexit, even more so than BBC&#39;s usual awful standards.  We&#39;re leaving at the end of the month, everyone can see that.
Comment786	A prime minister with balls. I think Boris should put the exit/approval of the deal to a referendum and forget about the MPs. Let the people vote.
Comment787	Trump is getting twitchy, that&#39;s for sure!
Comment788	When as an honest and equitable but ultimately failing leader will Johnson have the good grace to resign? Question mark, question mark.<br />Perhaps more pertinently when will the world, its mother and Jezzer realize that the Labour Party deserves far better?
Comment 788.1	Gnarlf<br />You obviously understand sarcasm, the lowest form of wit.<br />Well done, you are counted as a doyen amongst the electorates of the Earth. <br />Which gives us an insight into the informed vote of the British people in mid 2016.
Comment 788.2	&quot;honest and equitable&quot; sure, if you say so.<br />Don&#39;t wait for his resignation. He can&#39;t write one while dead in a ditch and he promised that, so it must be true.
Comment789	BOTH UNITED KINGDOM &amp; EUROPEAN UNION  get extra-valuable time for more discussions. Experience of Past Show that every time Parliament get more time they have Worked upon few More Un-agreed TRADE NEGOTIATIONS  in a better Frame then just Having TUSSLE(Dis-agreement).<br />20--10(OCTOBER)--2019 S U N D A Y
Comment790	I hope the EU just kicks them out. This is laughable.
Comment 790.1	Diogo F<br />The EU needs to give them space to realise that they are dealing with democracy.<br />Both the EU and the British need to realise this.
Comment 790.2	Google this Diogo, if you want to awaken yourself to the political mess started so many years ago.<br />Google: Europa the last battle archive<br /><br /><br />Watch the documentary in the first link.. Good luck!
Comment791	Guess what would sort out the issue on the Irish border..... A united Ireland
Comment 791.1	Colin Anderson<br />No it wouldn&#39;t
Comment792	Yay, another Brexit episode next week. lol
Comment793	Labours already turned its back on there traditional voters.
Comment794	Да чтоб вы все передохли мрази
Comment795	It is not unsigned<br />with ultraviolet light you can actually see BoJo‘s signature on the letter
Comment 795.1	G Rou you are right my friend
Comment 795.2	In natural light, with at least one functional eye in your head, it is possible to see it was written by the UK parliament, not government. Boris wrote another letter urging for no further delay. 😜😜😜
Comment796	I didn’t sign a letter when I was 11.
Comment 796.1	Yes you are gullibleAnd probably too late to develop wisdom or common sense
Comment 796.2	Gullible
Comment 796.3	You are still &quot;spitting your spoilt kid dummy out&quot;Boris is a smart guy - You may need to read slowly and think really really hard to keep up with himOr you could just have a temper tantrum like the other Remoaners
Comment 796.4	I was very childish in those days. I’ve since learnt that spitting my ‘spoilt kid dummy out’ doesn’t impress parents looking out for their children’s future.
Comment 796.5	Someone forced you to send a letter at 11?
Comment797	Boris is a Hero.
Comment798	Well, at least if Brexit is postponed the Labour Party will no longer have a pretext to postpone a general election.  An election before January will essentially become a referendum on Brexit.  In that case, only the Johnson faction of the Conservatives and the Lib-Dems among major parties have any clear position,  Labour is rather wishy-washy on the question of Brexit, and I&#39;m not sure the British people are in the mood for wishy-washy positions.  So far Corbyn&#39;s parliamentary maneuvers to embarrass the government have been successful, but in a general election, these parliamentary victories could prove to be Pyrrhic
Comment799	The bbc yet agen propaganda fuck me  listen to them fuck um  all ruining the United kingdom
Comment 799.1	Your definition of propaganda = Anything you don&#39;t agree with . Your definition of real news =Anything that feeds into your narrow biased views .<br /><br /><br />By law the BBC has to be impartial unlike the newspapers you probably read . That is where the real propaganda is  in the likes of the Daily Mail , Daily Express , the Daily Mirror and the Sun .
Comment800	Unlike the European loving anti democrats shown on this March, most of us welcome the stance Boris is taking for Britain. I suppose these same people would have protested against Churchill when he stood up to and beat the last European who wanted to dominate us. Bring on a General Election so that we can have a British Government of the people and spend the billions of pounds that London gets each year outside of the London Bubble, in the North, East, South and West of Britain where they deserve it far more than those in London who think it’s their right to have it. <br />We need to purge our schools and universities of the left, we need to purge the publicly funded BBC and Channel four of their left wing commentators and directors and we need to get rid of those in the civil service who leak State business to the media for profit.
Comment 800.1	Funny how history can be forgotten so fast.<br />Sure Churchill stood up to face the foe,  but last time i checked, the allied forces won that war not the britsh alone.<br />Which should remind people, that we are stronger together.<br />Or do you realy think britain could have stood on it&#39;s own without help back then?<br /><br /><br />Oh and just one fun fact:<br />The last idiot who tried to dominate Britain, was the one who abandoned the treaties his nation had with other european countries and made his people believe they are strong enough to stand on their own against the world and should do so.
Comment 800.2	⚠️8.4m struggling to eat <br />⚠️1.9m OAPs in poverty <br />⚠️1m waiting for social housing <br />⚠️4.1m children in poverty <br />⚠️1m+ Foodbank users <br />⚠️8m work-age adults in poverty<br />⚠️165% rough sleeping hike  <br />Like the Tories on the right are working for the benefit of the people. <br />🤔🤔🤔
Comment801	If Boris voted for May deal. We would be out. Boris wanted PM and undermined former prime minister.
Comment 801.1	@drew woods okay thats news to me.
Comment 801.2	He did vote for Mays deal on the second reading .
Comment802	Democracy without majority is chaos, democracy with a majority is dictatorship - sad to see how democracy has deteriorated.
Comment 802.1	There is no democracy.
Comment 802.2	If those remainers just accept the result of the referendum, nothing like this will happen. Even third world countries will accept the result of any public vote..
Comment803	OMG get out at last, get back to your splendid isolation and do NOT forget to leave Northern Ireland, Scotland, Gibraltar and the Falklands at the exit, thank you very much and goodbye!
Comment 803.1	@Ford Torino No, because the Falklands doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the EU, which is the subject of the video.
Comment 803.2	@Jock Duff <br /><br />You&#39;re joking, right?
Comment 803.3	I&#39;d be rather curious what the Falklands has to do with any of things? Sounds like you&#39;re just listing off a bunch of random places.
Comment 803.4	In democratic countries they have the right to choose what their destiny is.<br />No one in the UK has stopped any of those countries leaving.<br />Unless you have evidence to the contrary?
Comment804	this is what a protest should look like regardless of what you are protesting about. Hong Kong should learn from this.
Comment 804.1	Eihctir Beelat<br />The Scots or the effete and fairly hopeless Welsh or the intransigent nutters of NI are allowed some ability to protest against inequality.<br />Hong Kong should also be afforded this facility, but of course Chinese totalitarianism is contra.
Comment805	Jo swinson needs sacked. Stands up saying millions of people are outside and want a peoples vote. But she has already said &quot;i&#39;m stopping brexit&quot; so why have a peoples vote if you are deciding for them. we may as well be livining in China.
Comment806	Halal stands for Hello Andy Lewisham, At Longheaton
Comment807	Fat Boris ‘Rat’ Johnson can’t fulfill his own promises, can’t even do his own job. Pathetic.
Comment808	We know the establishment, British judicial system and MSM is corrupt, we need a leader like President Trump to put things right and to remove socialism once and for all.  ENGLAND should have its own government like all the countries in Europe.

Comment 810.2	@Peter Barton The fight for freedom knows no borders
Comment 810.3	Is Canada having a Brexit vote of some sort?
Comment 810.4	BREXIT AND DEATH !!!
Comment 810.5	superzentredi that’s quite an extreme choice.
Comment811	What a joke. Weather your left. Right. Leave. Stay. This is a joke. The UK voted leave. So until that is done this is not democracy.
Comment 811.1	@Martin Baldwin-Edwards <br /><br />You&#39;re right, it&#39;s not about badly managed referenda.<br />It&#39;s also not about rushed and badly written Bills that appear to have more holes in them than a dartboard.
Comment 811.2	Kindly stop posting your simple-minded nonsense. The real world is complex; and democracy is not about stupid badly-managed referenda anyway.
Comment 811.3	@Ford Torino The UK left the driveway 3 years ago.<br />An analogie can bring you only part of the way. In the end they have to fall flat, since they are simmilar but not the same. I recognice that.<br /><br /><br />So to be honest. I would rather have the UK leave sooner than later, but i want the UK to have a safe ride along the way.<br />The referendum was held, the decision was made and then began a process.<br />All i&#39;m saying is:<br />As long es Brexit is not stoped, the result of the referendum is still honored. So it is still democracy. Slow and painful, but democracy.<br />And to be clear about this. I believe that not leaving the EU after the referendum was held, would be one of Britains greatest mistakes since... well since the referendum itself i guess.
Comment 811.4	@Gnarlf <br /><br />If we get back to politics using your analogy.<br />In the case of the LibDems under Cable and more recently Swinson.<br />They have no intention of going to Disneyland and wish to basically stay at home and keep the status quo negating any promises that parliament made about seeing Mickey and Minnie.<br />Others like Dominic Grieve and Anna Sourbry represent constituents that voted to leave and stood on mandates to uphold the referendum. So they promised that they&#39;d agree to go and see Pluto and Goofy but have now said that they are not going because they also prefer to stay at home.<br />So the conclusion would be that they promised Disneyland but decided to stay at home, the car couldn&#39;t get stuck in a traffic jam because they had no intention of letting it leave the driveway.
Comment 811.5	@Ford Torino If these obstackles are:<br />- go pack your luggage<br />- fasten your seatbelt<br />- no don&#39;t stcik your head out of the car or we will stop<br />- let&#39;s stop for a bathroom break<br />- we have to refuel<br />Then yes, it sounds very reasonable, just not for the child.
Comment812	Fuck sake the finale of this series has been postponed due to this amendment 😤

Comment815	and another extension, after that another extension, after that another extension, after that another extension, after that another extension, after that another extension, after that another extension, .......if the EU let&#39;s the UK get away with this nonsense years from now we&#39;ll still be at te same point as we are now and asking for another extension,
Comment 815.1	Stefan laluna<br />Democracy is tricky.<br />For instance if I were the President of Hungary I would most likely shoot you for raising your hand.
Comment816	extension on second vote only.. or fo. .
Comment817	Unsigned letter. Isn&#39;t it unlawful?
Comment 817.1	There is no law now...it is like the Wild West.
Comment 817.2	Second letter with the purpouse to negate the first, isn&#39;t that unlawful too?<br />Maybe his &quot;ditch&quot; is going to have barred windows.
Comment818	Get on with it
Comment819	This is not against Europe    IT is against  the EU .
Comment 819.1	Yup
Comment 819.2	Precisely, and since the UK is not in Europe and is not european it has therefore nothing to do in the EU.
Comment820	I thought it said he sent the letter without singing... mind you nothing would surprise me these days!
Comment 820.1	Mike Butcher<br />Thanks for that.<br />I can now only see Boor-ees as a boy soprano.
Comment821	Man so annoyed at seeing this still going on. If it’s taken y’all this long and still can’t agree on a deal then you👏🏽don’t 👏🏽deserve 👏🏽a 👏🏽deal 👏🏽. <br />Like I don’t get why you think the EU should give you an amazing deal for leaving them - like ofc theyre not. Then all this stuff with Northern Ireland and how under this deal they’ll be under different rules or whatever... well it’s hard when you’re legit separated by water. Like what kind of deal are you after???? You can’t have your cake and eat it. Deal has been rejected, just accept the no deal already and get it over with. No do-overs, no new referendum, just accept no deal and move on - idk why it’s so difficult 🤦🏻‍♂️
Comment822	Wow🌐all eyes on uk....brixet

Comment825	Well done Boris. As a remain voter who respects our democracy over our membership of the EU, I for one am proud of his stance.<br />Perhaps the next Parliament ought to be held in the North, so than not a few hundred thousands but million of people can show their support for him and his resilience. Let’s see how many Bubble dwellers will dare go North to wave their European banners in the face of the real British people. Again, well done Boris.
Comment 825.1	Agreed
Comment826	Boris Johnson will face contempt of court proceedings next week after sending not one, but two letters to the European Union tonight following yet another parliamentary defeat over the ‘Letwin amendment’.<br /><br />The Letwin motion required him to do so in order to allow all legislation relating to his deal to be passed before the deal is formalised.<br /><br />Johnson sent an unsigned letter to the EU via a diplomat to ask for an extension – while sending a signed letter telling the EU that to grant one would be ‘deeply corrosive’:
Comment 826.1	&quot;The Letwin motion required him to do so in order to allow all legislation relating to his deal to be passed before the deal is formalised.&quot;<br />And everybody cries they voted against that deal.<br />I wonder where they get their information from. Probably a reliable venerable source without bias that states all the facts clearly so everybody can make up their own mind.<br /><b>cough</b> sorry wishful thinking.<br />probably the Sun
Comment827	The Germans will never give the UK a good deal ever.
Comment 827.1	Its not the Germans, it&#39;s the EU, and it&#39;s not the UK, its little Engerland.

Comment835	This Parliament was elected before Referendum, clearly they took their stands against people&#39;s vote. So they must go away. The Queen need to save Britain from such stalemate situation and help Britain to cross over the blockage. If this parliament is broken, there will be another General Election where MPs will be elected based on their promises on Brexit to British People. These MPs are abusing their authority making harmful laws to bind PM and other Officers who are trying to prepare Britain to get ready for post Brexit Britain. We must get rid off them, get rid off all of them.
Comment 835.1	Remember:<br />Cameron - Referendum - May - Election.<br />I know history is forgotten fast, but that fast is just rediculus

Comment846	Labour scum anti democrats you are finished, turn the lights out when you leave.<br />Hahahaha.
Comment847	The one good thing that has come out of this disgraceful stalling mischievous behaviour from the majority of our MP&#39;s, is that by going against the people&#39;s vote, democracy and simple fair play, they are committing political suicide. Come the general election the majority of them will be voted out by a landslide Boris majority. The wheat will be sorted from the naff ! Touche !!

Comment 848.3	Who are the “democrats” then? What do they stand for? Who do they represent? <br />If you are thinking that the Conservative MPs or the ERG members would stand alongside the general public who voted Leave in 2016 you are mistaken. <br />The poorest regions in the North and in Wales had more Leave voters but the Tory/ERG Government would never stand by your side to support you and the millions who voted for Brexit.<br /><br />Just ask them and find out where you stand, they would rather cross the street than look a poverty stricken person in the eye.

Comment 866.2	You do know what happens in the story &quot;The never ending story&quot; The story kills the country.
Comment867	Wow, how democratic... But you will get nothing done...
Comment868	Brexit and the never ending delay, we will never actually leave. It will be constant delays and transition periods followed by more delays then votes on delays and then a transition period after the delay. The new deal will be adjourned to be voted on at a different time by then the deal will be marginally rejected by mp&#39;s causing another negotiation period where pm&#39;s are flown out to Brussels on tax payers money to eat croissants and drink coffee come back home with the exact same deal but the headings and sub headings have been changed this time only for the deal to be voted down again then we have another delay and so the cycle continues well the never ending delay does go on and on...
Comment 868.1	Adam Lee I have a feeling  that london will soon be invaded by the leave majority and be torn to pieces. And I wouldn’t blame them. This won’t be riots though. It will be like football firms fighting but x17000000. People will actually be seriously injured. Every remainer should ask themselves right now whether or not they are prepared to physically fight for the Eu, to risk their lives even. Because If leavers are Denied their democratic victory which they earned by going to the polls then I can guarantee that they will be up in Arms, quite literally. And remainers should run and hide. This won’t be about what’s right and wrong, the line will have been crossed and there will be civil war.
Comment 868.2	I find some of the comments very disturbing to say Britain was the driver the teacher of democracy and the rule of law in the world surely have stamps on their history! I find it very very insulting to people who believe they are free and they are in control in a westernised democratic country like Britain! <br /><br />It’s sad that the puppets that voted to remain inn a foreign political parliamentary law and order Union actually believe forcing the people that voted overwhelmingly to leave, to remain inn without consent or vote is wrong and will only cause civil unrest/War! You think uk summer riots was bad well you’ll all soon see the damage your hoping to cause

Comment 873.1	@Jon Seymour yes. I saw the protest today. Alot of old people wearing glasses. They looked relatively well off. Their lives are not going to change if we in or out of the EU. Just a bunch of stuck up moaning low lives who got nothing better to do than disrupt traffic. By the time we get out of the EU alot of them will be dead lol
Comment 873.2	People die every day anyway.

Comment 877.1	Bloody right as you say, &quot;these career politicians!!!&quot; They are everywhere, not just in the UK, Globally only thinking about themselves and no one else! Maybe not six but two terms i.e. 8 years!  Then back to civi street.........

Comment 884.2	@This is Me <br />Stop repeating the same already demolished falsehoods.
Comment 884.3	I do think a second referendum might be the way to go (but that wasn’t my point). Not that I think that’s a wonderful thing, but rather it might be the most practical way out of this as leavers can’t seem to agree either on how to leave.<br /><br />Personally, I’d like to see remain on the ballot, given all the additional information that’s come out. But I’d say there’s an argument to be made for accepting that the ref. of 2016 already gave an answer to leave and now you only include this deal (May minus), no deal and ‘I don’t care’
Comment885	Can people stop making it a big deal that they came in on Saturday? Boo hoo. Jesus christ. Politicians are so entitled these days.<br /><br />They have the balls to talk about their &#39;constituents&#39; who work 60hr weeks and feel so proud that they came in a God damn Saturday.<br /><br />Jesus christ.
Comment886	The Metro reports Speaker Bercow has been Inducted into the SS (Special Section) of Momentum and gave a rousing Speech to the Labour Activists....&#39;ARE YOU READY ?......ARE YOU READY FOR TOTAL WAR ??&#39;....to Thunderous Applause from the SS.....Jeremy and Dianne could not attend as they were having Gender Re-Assignment Treatment......
Comment887	A Trump in UK!??? Oh no 🤦‍♀️.
Comment 887.1	Least he&#39;s not &quot;Queen of the Warmongers&quot; Hillary Clinton..
Comment888	The London Circus does not cease to amaze! Better and better... On the 31st October they will be expelled from the EU, right?
Comment 888.1	@André hope dearly..
Comment 888.2	@André I sincerely hope so
Comment 888.3	@Josh Asprey Freedom to Scotland and Wales! Reunification of Ireland and expel England from the EU, right?
Comment 888.4	@Josh Asprey 2019!
Comment 888.5	which year🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comment889	Yay!!! Teresa is back!!!
Comment 889.1	@rdmo83 lol I dont think anyone will ever confuse Mrs May for a comedian.
Comment 889.2	And she still hasn&#39;t mastered the art of delivering a joke.
Comment890	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xhny-VF4-Y&amp;t=1m20s"">1:20</a> &quot;He&#39;s obliged now by [UK] law...&quot; Whoops! EU law is only interested in dealing with governments, and how does UK law lie in relation to EU law?. Fuck them, Boris, the EU have treated us with contempt."
Comment891	Stick your deal up your Johnson 😂😂😂
Comment 891.1	He doesn&#39;t have one unlike his sister
Comment 891.2	Ouch.
Comment892	Lots of coverage for the remain camp, but what about the democratic votes of 17.4 million which are being betrayed.
Comment 892.1	@Josh Asprey No. Lol. Only your stupid arse believes that. Remoanertards are cancer.
Comment 892.2	@James Watson Atheist Gamer I highly doubt that especially the fact that now a majority is against it..
Comment 892.3	@James Watson Atheist Gamer I am not British so I don&#39;t care whether you leave or stay. Many people were deceived at the time of the referendum and now want to stay when they finally understand what it means to leave aftet these 3 years, but they should have thought about being well informed before the vote, now they must face the consequences for their decisions. So the sooner Britain leaves for me the better.
Comment 892.4	@Josh Asprey Yes. Case closed.
Comment 892.5	@Plo Koon Of course they do. Stop being stupid. Most people want out. The remoanertards and that includes you. Are inconsequential.
Comment893	What&#39;s the United Kingdom come to...<br />Are we just going to vote. Then the people they didn&#39;t agree want another vote, then when they win, the people that don&#39;t agree want another vote, etc.....<br />Disgrace.....
Comment 893.1	Nope; there will be another vote and it will be 60% in favour to REMAIN.<br />Democracy lives on in the people. Democracy is not dead - unless you are a losing Brexiteers who moans about project facts.
Comment 893.2	This is the problem when you don&#39;t honour democracy, shame on them and their selfish personal agenda..  worse than the us republican party
Comment894	Bring on prime minister Farage
Comment 894.1	@Yvonne McLay And 3-ply tissues.
Comment 894.2	Mr PipeCx go back to your picture of Nigel on the wall and your massage oil
Comment 894.3	He needs to win at least one election first.
Comment895	I cannot wait for a general election, all those MPs that voted to frustrate the Brexit process are toast.
Comment896	Folks, it ain&#39;t over &#39;till Diane Abbott sings.
Comment 896.1	Gordon Welford 🤗
Comment 896.2	@C G E It&#39;s funny cos it&#39;s true! (Genius level humour sir!)
Comment 896.3	I see Diane Abbott much the same way as I see a cat with its legs in Smarties tubes.
Comment 896.4	Gordon Welford 🤣😂🤣
Comment897	cant stand ian blackford..
Comment 897.1	I don’t think it’s a good idea to mix SNP objectives with Brexit situation. Scottish remainers don’t represent the whole constituents of UK. So it s a good thing to let the MPs check what‘s wrong or right in the new Brexit deal...
Comment 897.2	@Julien G good i am glad it helps you truly... but i just can not stand him and that little smerk he has on his face..
Comment 897.3	Web Post but as a non-english speaker (I’m French, living in France), Blackford’s accent allows me to understand Scottish accent 😁
Comment898	Northern Ireland is already behind.
Comment899	Why delay!.. <br />Labour are a disgrace.....<br />Leave, go forward and deal with it....
Comment900	Has anyone not realized most of these marchers are based In London. Most Brexiteers are in the heartland and north and would have to travel to protest
Comment 900.1	@Finn MickCool  we r already poor food banks everywhere it can&#39;t git any worse i believe we will b better off out the EU !!!!
Comment 900.2	G J<br />Most of them are so stupid and poor they can&#39;t work out that Brexit could make them poorer.<br />Just don&#39;t whine that if Her Majesty&#39;s government imprisons you for raiding skips as a food source, that you don&#39;t pathetically attempt to blame it on the EU.
Comment 900.3	@Loraine at total-lifechange  i never heard fo any buses  leaving here in scotland??? And I would know this . fake news by sounds of it if there was any  then must have been very few . 95% were from London
Comment 900.4	Yes all teachers and students and retired civil service etc. Horrible
Comment 900.5	Haha. Not true, its complicated. Stockport voted for remain.
Comment901	Look, I’m about staying In the EU... but look at yourselves. I was remain all the way and my country.., SCOTLAND voted to stay. I don’t care about if SCOTLAND gets a special deal or Not, I’m angry at these protesters, majority of them English, I apologise, but it’s your country’s (England) ideology and people voted for this sh*t show, Now deal with it it! How dare you drag SCOTLAND and it’s people into this mess and then turn around and beg for another referendum... shut your mouth and respect democracy, the leave vote won so if we like it or not we are leaving the EU... if we have a second referendum on this matter then democracy has failed.  End of.
Comment 901.1	"Democracy has failed because the 2015/General Election were Cameron won his majority was rigged. The Electoral commission report was published in 2017, it was to late to change things. <br />The 2016 EU referendum should never have been held. It went ahead and again the result was rigged the campaigns put out disinformation and lies, they overspent, they manipulated the voters, divided the nation, the bad boys of Brexit bank rolled dark ads and made huge profits on the side when the pound tanked. <br />The Governments own select report into the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BrexitCrimeScene"">#BrexitCrimeScene</a> was published in 2018. <br /><br />Brexit was never going to solve any of the problems present in the UK. <br />⚠️8.4m struggling to eat <br />⚠️1.9m OAPs in poverty <br />⚠️1m waiting for social housing <br />⚠️4.1m children in poverty <br />⚠️1m+ Foodbank users <br />⚠️8m work-age adults in poverty<br />⚠️165% rough sleeping hike  <br />It is the current Government that is behind these issues, the current Tory/ERG that was behind the Vote Leave lies. Only a United UK can solve these issues with a Government that works for everyone not just the wealthy and the super rich, or the Eton and Oxford educated."
Comment 901.2	Am English and I agree with you
Comment902	Boris - a complete Eton mess.
Comment903	If the UK reinstated the death penalty for the strategic purpose of leaving the EU wouldn&#39;t that solve Boris&#39; problems.
Comment 903.1	The trouble is that to reinstate death penalty, you need the UK parliament to vote .
Comment904	☝🤴Dont do that dont remove the Ukraine what ever founding you need its paid because thats the center of attack knowing the Ukraine is just under the north pole it can be sacked by some groups of lone wolf witch is different from isis and from the Ukraine you shut them out their take over that army and split their forces into russia and sack the queen completely that puts the queen in danger completely no one in europe is to be cut off not more then the british is trying to make pease with the queen ans longdon its self the deal is paid as fare as you wish sincerly king of mumbai india and general of the state courts transportation and tax officer U.S marines corps 6 general Timmons 🇮🇳🇺🇸🇬🇧.
Comment 904.1	PTSD and mental health are major issues and affecting people around the globe.
Comment905	Well that&#39;s very grown up of you Boris you lame duck quack quack
Comment906	What does it have to do with the courts???????????? It is the will of the people!
Comment 906.1	@Elaine Stewart Did they vote on how to leave? No?<br />Then it is parliaments job to work that out.<br />It`s called representative democracy and still represents the &quot;will of the people&quot;<br />As long as Brexit isn`t cancled the referendum is still respected.<br />So can we please stop polarizing and work together for a satisfying conclusion?
Comment 906.2	@English Grammar You must have attended one of those &#39;Dum Down The People Public Schools&#39;!The British people voted in a Democratic Referendum to leave the EU!Its called Democracy!
Comment 906.3	What, the Tory party with only 42.4% of the vote pushing for a no deal Brexit? No other Western country would ever allow a government in power with less than 50% popular support. Will of the people, you&#39;re having a laugh! Will of the people, it&#39;s just not British!
Comment907	I feel as if I am back at school ! As in, &#39;We Are Going To DO This Over And Over Again! Until you peasants GET IT RIGHT AND VOTE TO STAY IN THE EU! This is disgusting! All of this parliament should be thrown out, because it does not represent the people of Britain anymore!
Comment908	Who are these people representing
Comment 908.1	They are representing parliament. But parliament isn&#39;t representing the people.
Comment909	Well it would have been nice to blackmail the EU with the threat of no deal but they took that away.
Comment 909.1	Not sure if that&#39;s a way to blackmail the EU... It would be like me blackmailing my Tesco store that I won&#39;t visit them again, they couldn&#39;t give a rats ass. Sure the money would be nice but they have loads more customers.
Comment 909.2	Richard H<br />Your point is?<br />Because I see fuck all apart from lack of clarity.
Comment 909.3	What blackmail? The only one with the power to blackmail here is the EU. No deal hurts the UK more than the Eu, are you naive to think this is something between equals? No the EU has all the bargaining power in the negotiation and they are sick of the UK postponing its leaving, ever since the referendum the UK and Brexit are pretty much dead weight. The EU should just kick out the UK for all this pathetic gestures of sending letters only to then say they want nothing to do with that letter.
Comment910	wot then
Comment911	Labour is deliberately circumventing the British referendum
Comment 911.1	So are the Conservatives
Comment 911.2	Oliver Letwin a conservative MP organised this vote today not Labour . I suggest you stop playing video games and start paying attention to facts .
Comment 911.3	@Lizardsruletheworld And you want to be ruled by minorities, what exactly does that make you? Proud?
Comment 911.4	@English Grammar God you&#39;re stupid.
Comment 911.5	@rdmo83 Absolute rubbish! If you&#39;re talking about America, only twice in the last 100 years did the winning party not get more than 50% of the vote. That was Trump and George Bush junior. Not once in the entire 20th century did that happen! Two freakish statistical results. Americans unlike us stupid British fools would never allow governments to routinely come into power with less than 50% support.
Comment912	It&#39;s always the Scots complaining in spite of having self rule and more cash per capita than England. Let them have independence.
Comment 912.1	It&#39;s like bribing someone to pretend to be your friend, it is truly pathetic. Without that bribe you pay the Scots they&#39;d be out of the union tomorrow. Your precious United Kingdom means nothing. But you can&#39;t do anything about it because your aristocracy own land in Scotland. Lord snooty Rees-Mogg, land-owning aristocrat Nigel Farage and Dominic Cummings, who is married into aristocracy, will fight to protect their Tory friend&#39;s country estates and they are the government, not you!
Comment 912.2	Scotland cannot survive without handouts from Britain or the EU, there will never be an independent Scotland.
Comment 912.3	Free Catalonia
Comment913	I know nothing about UK politics but I trust the BBC. Am I correct in thinking that nobody in the UK wants to leave the EU and everyone is a remainer?
Comment 913.1	The BBC is corrupt and biased, run with a   left wing agenda, most of the country wants this over and wants to leave! The problem is the people that want to remain are students and the unemployed (no jobs to go to) hence why they can spend every waking moment outside the houses of parliament making a scene for the news crew
Comment 913.2	@Jonathan Young Are You having problems with reading comprehension ? stop being mental. or do I have to do it in a meme for you.
Comment 913.3	@Drake Hound not english language
Comment 913.4	No a big vocal group wants to leave the EU cause they have been blaiming everything on the EU just like in every other EU countries.<br />The uneducated people when EU is very transparant infact you can join EU brussel anytime you want as the most common person in Europe just need to get the votes, like 3 man german party proved in a social experiement and gotten paid 5k a week for doing nothing .
Comment914	They risk no deal exit just for political scores
Comment 914.1	I get the feeling they will revoke article 50 before no deal . Once that happens the mess will get even worse than it is now .
Comment915	The guy in the back saying stop brexit is fully retared
Comment 915.1	@Dally Singhson Also thinking about it...Yes plz show me the evidence..it would be an intriguing read.
Comment 915.2	@Dally Singhson wow such a hostile response...did i not say i can believe its true ?. i think you need to relax a little, and not take your self so serious man...Orderrrrrrr
Comment 915.3	@Web Post Do you need any evidence or are you so brainwashed that you got no cells left in that head of yours?
Comment 915.4	@itellzzz wouldn&#39;t surprise me tbh..
Comment 915.5	@Web Post the BBC are paying him
Comment916	Well that was VERY selective BBC, I was down in London today and I saw an equal amount of those that want to stay and those that want to leave in the crowds today. I&#39;m just saying how I saw it.
Comment 916.1	What more do you expect I can see big big trouble ahead if we dont leave this time  round
Comment 916.2	i think it&#39;s called bias
Comment917	If opposition parties have a better deal up their sleeves then why haven’t I heard what their proposals are? <br /><br />Why haven’t the BBC asked JC what would be reflected in his deal? He constantly says he would negotiate a better one? So what is it then?? <br /><br />If anyone had a solution to this but was withholding it, putting party politics over the greater good of the country then that person is a traitor in my mind.<br /><br />Let’s face it, we all know a second referendum would have a much smaller turnout and be a win for remain because why would any Brexit supporter feel that their vote would count this time around? <br /><br />Democracy is dead, long live Democracy!
Comment 917.1	@Adam Adam I&#39;m with you on this....as originally a remainer.<br /><br />Labour policy is this....a new deal staying in SM, CU, ECJ and FoM. All those are red lines. You put that to vote as a leaver now, even I would vote remain (that&#39;s if I vote).<br /><br />Then with this deal they want to put to the country and campaign against their own deal......then Corbyn realised, that&#39;s stupid even for us and then came to.....we know this is stupid, so individual Mps can campaign how they wish (so much for collective responcabity in a Labour cabinet) in the belief that voters themselves are stupid that Labour is both leave and remain depending on how you wish.<br /><br />Totally moronic policy, based on the assumption that Labour voters have the IQ of a garden vegetable and can&#39;t see through it.
Comment 917.2	Jock Duff Thank you for your reply Jock. <br /><br />Remaining in the Customs Union/single market without knowing the other aspects of a withdrawal agreement is not a deal. It is essentially remain without a seat at the table is it not? There is a lot more to a deal than just those two aspects so could you please show me where I can obtain more comprehensive information regarding what labour would negotiate? Or explain it to me? <br /><br />A deal that in essence is designed to remain in the EU in all but membership is not a Brexit deal at all, it is a remain deal that would force a second referendum leading to what I stated in my first comment.<br /><br />Would you want to remain in a customs union and have regulatory alignment with an entity that could make changes at any time? One that you would have no say over but must abide to? I myself would prefer to remain than have such a deal (I wonder if this is the plan of labour? 🤔).<br /><br />Please forgive me for supposing, but I imagine that you would not vote for that either and would prefer to stay in the EU where we would have a seat at the table?<br /><br />The problem is as a democracy we didn’t vote for an EU lite, the nation voted to leave.<br /><br />The other parties would naturally oppose the government, all politicians on both sides are egotistical and power hungry and would do anything to boost their own profiles, isn’t it funny how 3 years ago the majority of parties were for upholding the will of the people? Invoking article 50? Default no deal if agreement not reached? <br /><br />Then it appeared that the section of remain, the type who as children would cry if they didn’t win a game of hungry hippos, became extremely vocal in both the public and MSM. Opportunistic MPs then saw these people as an easy vote were they to play up to this and frustrate Brexit at all costs.<br /><br />Party politics has crippled Brexit, we could achieve anything if we just all worked together. <br /><br />Should it come about and be the disaster that some people say it would be then you can always vote for a party that campaigns for rejoining the EU no? Isn’t that democracy? <br /><br />Whatever happens remain/leave I hope yourself and everyone else continue to speak their mind and have their voices heard peacefully and without conflict.<br /><br />That to me is true democracy.
Comment 917.3	Well Adam, had you bothered to pay even the slightest bit of attention you&#39;d have known Labour, and the other parties, have actually been telling people their plans for a while. You could have easily Googled it, but I understand that as a Leave supporter basic fact checking is one of the many skills you do not posses. To keep it short for your attention span - A Labour leave deal would mean staying in the customs union and close to the single market. All opposition parties want a second vote, Lib Dems want to remain.<br /><br />It&#39;s no ones fault but your own when you chose to be willfully ignorant.
Comment 917.4	Lisa Christer I think you are correct with your assumptions. What has irked me throughout this is the “people know better now” narrative.<br /><br />It only ever has a very near sighted view of Brexit being bad for the economy/workers or if on the other side good for the economy/workers. Where are the facts? Oh wait you can’t have facts because that would mean predicting the future, so what are we left with? Forecasts/predictions that can be easily manipulated (again on both sides) to project an outcome favourable to your agenda. <br /><br />I haven’t read the full text of the new withdrawal agreement so am impressed that everyone else seems to have and can easily say it is a bad deal. I am of the opinion that a clean break would be the best option now, of course detrimental to our economy in the short term but people forget that we are British and don’t lose our resilience over time. <br /><br />The EU openly states that it is heading in a direction that opposes national sovereignty and will change over time regardless of one nations opposition within. <br /><br />Some hard facts please people on both sides, not just “someone who I perceive to be an expert says...” let’s remember some “experts” are saying the world will end in 12 years...
Comment 917.5	It&#39;s worse than that Adam. There&#39;s a huge percentage of leave voters who see Boris deal as a sell out. They won&#39;t vote for it and boycott any referendum. There&#39;s also leave voters (like me) who&#39;ll refuse to take part....as unlike remoaners I accept a win/lose poll. If I participate then I&#39;m accepting remain  and after winning a poll I&#39;m not prepared to accept.<br /><br />Then there&#39;s the SNP, they are happy to have a 2nd vote and participate in that vote but unwilling to accept win/lose.<br /><br />2nd ref is remain by a huge margin and low turnout.
Comment918	in the next general election it need be said to remove all those mp&#39;s who promised Brexit and didn&#39;t do it to stand again, there also need to be made a rule mp who defect parties should stand again in a bi-election period.they are put there by people for what they represent and if they don&#39;t then they should stand again. Especially cowards like Chuka Omnar.
Comment 918.1	Well Boris Johnson has promised it and not delivered .
Comment919	PM needs to obey the law made by the sovereign parliament for which Brexit is being desired? Conflicted??? Common mortals need to relax and leave it to MPs to sort it out... while life goes on... relax please...
Comment920	SHOW THE OTHER LETTER BBC ARE A DISGRACE
Comment 920.1	H PD Sky have released a copy.
Comment 920.2	The other letter may not have been made public. The one shown is the default one enshrined in the so-called Benn Act and is therefore in the public domain. Save your criticism until you understand the circumstances.
Comment921	Hey I guess the bill says he has to ask for an extension it doesnt say he cant also then change his mind. Smart
Comment 921.1	@Elliot Law Tnx.. this is what offshore funds&#39; people do too? Why do we complain... finding lacunas in laws to give advantage to themselves. But remember whatever we humans do in life has consequences... just wait and see... the mess is not going to go away..
Comment 921.2	@Elliot Law That&#39;s like saying you didn&#39;t murder somebody because you left a note with a gun attached- note declaring &quot;off yourself or I&#39;ll do your entire family&quot;.<br /><br /><br />Technically the guy wasn&#39;t murdered but the law ain&#39;t dumb.
Comment 921.3	@Elliot Law Actually it is illiegal  for him to do this, but he doesn&#39;t seem to care. I don&#39;t know what will come out of his refusal to sign the letter, which he was compelled to, but the second letter could have severe consequences for him.<br />Question ist:<br />Did he know that or was he thrown under the brexitbus by bad advise.
Comment 921.4	@Edward Russell he obeyed the law, he asked for an extension, the law therefor was obeyed, there&#39;s nothing written in law to say that Boris wasn&#39;t aloud to send a second letter saying an extension isn&#39;t necessary
Comment 921.5	Duplicity? Remember circumventing law is a bad model for general masses... laws must be obeyed whoever one is... what goes around comes around...
Comment922	He should have advised the Queen to refuse royal assent to the law preventing no deal.
Comment 922.1	@Youtuber Nugget well that was my input. I&#39;m not British, so my opinion doesn&#39;t matter.
Comment 922.2	rdmo83  she can&#39;t refuse royal accent to bills passed by parliament, well she can but that would cause a constitutional outrage and she won&#39;t do that
Comment 922.3	rdmo83...🙄...er...yeah, he&#39;s got a really good track record with his interactions with Old Lizzie!!!
Comment923	the UK had a sweet deal with the eu: got all free market advantages while keeping your own currency. Now you&#39;ll lose the free market and the decision making power with it...
Comment 923.1	Trump is still looking to buy an Island after the Greenland debacle. This might be the perfect candidate for the 51st US state.

Comment 924.1	Leights_0n same bro ahahahaha
Comment 924.2	😂😂😂
Comment925	Somebody will of signed it for him anyway,  he has broken the law. Arrest him now
Comment 925.1	Yes, that is a good idea.  Bang him in prison on bread and water.
Comment926	As you see this is absolutely definitely not a United king- &quot;whoops &quot; I mean Queendom ..such a shame
Comment 926.1	It&#39;s not even united.... Us Scots want to leave. Its just the english living here and the old fanny&#39;s that voted no last time... Not next time though
Comment 926.2	Shane redgate the only reason we still have a queen it’s because she makes millions for the country and it’s great for publicity, I’ve heard Londoners just call her a money machine. She does have political power but it’s best for everyone if she doesn’t use it and just let democracy do it’s thing and run along with it or else a King Charles I might happen again..
Comment 926.3	Sleeping Kitten “Like”
Comment 926.4	Just a Daft punk. She&#39;s 93 lol.
Comment 926.5	Shane redgate bruv she’s like 97, I know she still looks powerful because she’s meant to, but I don’t blame her for taking these last years for herself
Comment927	Look at all those boom remoaners.
Comment928	What a mess the Tories are in and they it&#39;s affected the country alredy with this sick Brexit they brought to the UK. Instead of fixing the internet social, work and health care problems the country in still under since ever. This contributed to leave votes.<br /><br />What now??<br />Well the Government want to make the UK chronic social,work and health care problems much worse with the hard Brexit agenda.<br /><br />They also want to willingly or not split the union.<br />They know a hard Brexit could do that but they don&#39;t care.Because they don&#39;t support soft Brexit or people vote for softer Brexit or no Brexit.<br /><br />They know a softer brecit will be good for people and the economy. Also will save will cost billions much less to the UK instead of a hard Brexit. The money will boost many desperate services in the UK and will create jobs and better health care.Billions and billions a month will cost the UK incase of no deal...and somewhat less then that with May&#39;s deal 4. But still billion of losses in case of a hard Brexit.<br /><br />But the Government simply don&#39;t care.<br /><br />The government was cool to trick the queen handmade her agree to the unlawful suspension of the parliament. <br /><br />Yet many MPs are supporting the government including some opposition MPs which so strange and makes you think what&#39;s is wrong with them or what s there for them to support Boris for his hard Brexit agenda. Knowing verywell he can&#39;t be trusted. <br /><br />France ,Germany, Ireland do have  financial gains in future from the negotiated deal it pass. As the UK over all status including the currency will weaken for unknown future. <br />So strange to see May talking again and it just look exactly like the old May as PM trying to make her old deal pass. The only defence this time is the position of Tories seats but the language and the deal more or less the same but with worse desperate people .<br /><br />The opposition still the same trying to get what is right for all the UK not just to please brexiters who didn&#39;t change their minds yet.<br /><br />The failed Brexit so far isn&#39;t the fault of anyone. It&#39;s beacuse of the democratic process and the UK population should be proud of this. It is sending a strong message to the rest of the world that a government is not higher then the parliament and the law.<br /><br />The unfair Brexit campaign promising a good soft Brexit Norway style and all the 350 m a week to the NHS  This unfair behaviour was undemocratic .All these has contributed to challenges the government is facing right now. <br /><br />The biggest problem right now is the fact that Boris is full of good words to BRAINWASH people in order to get what he want but not what he promised to give and do. History confirm the fact that he can&#39;t be trusted. And that is it.<br /><br />Boris May&#39;s deal 4 which he is calling it a new deal.<br />That deal is a hard deal and could get even harder if it pass. No way to be sure of ANY FREE  TRADE DEAL WITH THE EU.
Comment 928.1	TLDR
Comment929	reminds me of writing the report at the last minute
Comment930	A million people? Total nonsense!!!
Comment931	Brexit Bashing Corporation
Comment932	What a pussy, hope he ends up disgraced.
Comment933	So he broke the law.
Comment 933.1	@mhffc because,you prick,we all know that during an election no parlimentary businesses can take place, allowing Bojo an opportunity to push one after the deadline. And do you think giving a man that power is wise after he lied to the Queen herself?<br /><br />Geez, you ever heard of consequences!
Comment 933.2	@NJ4K Hold an election and then let&#39;s see what happens. All those Tory MP&#39;s who were elected to take the UK out of the EU and now have left the party. Didn&#39;t see one of them fight a by-election, wonder why. Let us vote, then you&#39;ll see who&#39;s got the numbers, or are you running scarred..
Comment 933.3	@glyn hodges it says he has to sign it. It also says he can&#39;t send another letter saying &quot;psyche. Don&#39;t really want it&quot;<br /><br />Read
Comment 933.4	@mhffc get the votes for this to be legal and you got a law. Wassa matter, don&#39;t have the numbers? Awww.
Comment 933.5	We&#39;re just making up laws as we go along now, as long as they&#39;re anti-Brexit..
Comment934	Any outcome other than Brexit would undermine the democracy of this country. &quot;Remain&quot; was removed from the table three years ago. Anyone trying to prevent Brexit or undermine the referendum result opposes democracy.<br /><br />The deal doesn&#39;t need to be perfect. A compromise is acceptable. Let&#39;s just get this done and move on.
Comment 934.1	@Drake Hound I oppose having a &quot;confirmatory vote&quot; in principle, because it blatantly undermines the validity of the first vote. Democracies cannot function by voting and voting on the same issue ad nauseam - especially when the motives for wanting one at all are highly suspect.<br /><br />If you want a vote, though, let&#39;s have a general election. I support that in principle, and it will be a fair indicator of which way the public wants to go.
Comment 934.2	@Grymbaldknight So what are you afraid off that you will lose, if you are so sure you will win again. that is the will of the people ever so fast and changing.
Comment 934.3	@Grymbaldknight Really well news flash Liberal Democrats want to put up another referendum. so all remainers vote that. be done with it. I bet if they do what I say the numbers will surpass 16 million.
Comment 934.4	@Drake Hound Every political party and major political figure agreed to abide by the result of the referendum. The government (and/or parliament) may not be legally obligated to fulfil the result of the referendum, but they voted en-masse to have the referendum in the first place, and there will be hell to pay if they revoke Article 50.<br /><br />It was a referendum - a vote. It wasn&#39;t a survey, or a poll. It was a vote. We voted to leave.<br /><br />It doesn&#39;t really matter who&#39;s left in government and who isn&#39;t. The result of the vote stands, and will continue to stand.
Comment 934.5	@Grymbaldknight Well then you go implement the Referendum which by Law is not even legally binding, and all the people who implemented that vote already quit.<br />Shows you a big sign of confidence in their campaign.
Comment935	I think most of them just wanted a day out
Comment 935.1	Making the most of the salmon and champagne breakfasts while they still can.
Comment936	Why wrangle, why negotiate, why strike a deal, why a transition period, why more delays. We just leave then we negotiate.
Comment937	Ffs, take the deal and leave or give the people the chance to vote again for remain. Whatever it is, do something, god. I&#39;m not even british and I&#39;m tired of these endless extensions. Make up your goddamn mind already.
Comment 937.1	You want a Losers vote? Why?
Comment 937.2	Or also go without a deal. That&#39;s another important option. No need for another vote.
Comment 937.3	Hamish Somerville UK talking about democracy 😂🤪😂😂😂
Comment 937.4	Scotland and NI remains, England and maybe Wales too then leave is the best solution for interests.
Comment 937.5	We are a Democratic Country no more Referendums
Comment938	Oh I should have waited further into the report there are the flags, surprise surprise!!!
Comment939	this PM is so very hard headed he didnt follow any laws passed by parliaments he must forced to resign by toppling his govt thru a no confident vote or thru general election ASAP b4 the nation economy torn out !!!!
Comment940	What will Boris do when he is charged with contempt of Court on Monday he promised a Judge in Scotland he would send the letter and ask for an extention he thinks he is above the law
Comment 940.1	@Evelyn Fullerton He still sent the letter, why would he sign something you don&#39;t agree with..He did what the court made him do...
Comment 940.2	@Evelyn FullertonHe is on record emphatically not wishing for any extension. So what? There is an article of international law that renders void any treaty agreement signed by a coerced party any way. Do you actually believe the courts should be involved in the halting of UK democracy because YOU didn&#39;t like the voters verdict? You seem to be hoping they will, poor quisling.
Comment 940.3	@C Laws he did not sign it, and he sent a second letter saying he did not want an extention, anyway it goes back to court on Monday
Comment 940.4	But he sent the letter, exactly as worded in the bill. Poor desperate quisling.
Comment941	Brilliant mr johnson out no deal 31st oct,remainers had there chance accept the deal 👍👍👍🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Comment 941.1	You do realize he intends to put this deal to the commons again once they have secured legislation preventing on reneging on it at the last minute before the 31st . This actually makes his deal more likely to pass and takes the no deal scenario out of his hands . On top of that the commons will probably amend it to tie us to a customs union . Did you even watch the analysis on the news and react just by reading the Tory Press . This is not good news if you want a WTO Brexit just wait and see .
Comment 941.2	their chances
Comment942	He is a 4 year old petulant boy.  We need a government of unity to dump this fool ASAP. He is utterly unfit.
Comment 942.1	So when he called for a GE the opposition denied his wishes. First time the opposition have refused to fight an election. Unity Government,  Labour, LibDems and the SNP, the latter being the most divisive party in the UK..Haven&#39;t thought this through have you..
Comment 942.2	@glyn hodges Corbyn cant take part in a GE, he has a note from his mum.
Comment 942.3	Well, we could have a general election if Corbyn did not keep refusing to ask for one.
Comment 942.4	But parliament being 80% elected on a lie that they would deliver Brexit, and refusing to honour a three year old referendum, while refusing to give the public a general election are perfectly fit and proper?<br /><br /><br /><br />Your a remainer, aren&#39;t you?
Comment943	Got my vote..
Comment 943.1	I suspect if Boris too a steaming great shit in the house of commons on live TV he would still get your vote .
Comment944	anti brexit are muppets simple
Comment945	WE THE PEOPLE DEMAND A GENERAL ELECTION NOW. NO EXCUSES.
Comment946	<b>I predicted this years ago.</b>
Comment947	Come on France you know you want to veto an extension, do it and end this
Comment 947.1	Why are you guys begging the EU to do the UK&#39;s homework?
Comment 947.2	If that happens I imagine the commons will revoke article 50 .
Comment 947.3	I think it’s treasonous how all these protestors have EU flags, they obviously have divided loyalties and favor the EU superstate
Comment 947.4	This is the same EU27 that&#39;s been following everything and extended article 51 twice. France indeed has power, but in their interests they will have no choice but to extend.<br />Macron made vague threats but said nothing definite.
Comment 947.5	france aren&#39;t going to punch themselves in the face to please little englanders
Comment948	I THINK ITS TIME FOR THE 17.4  to show ourselves, we&#39;ve been silent to long. Time to get off our backsides and fight for our democracy and our glorious country.
Comment 948.1	You&#39;re free to do that, but I doubt many of that 17.4mn can even get off their butts let alone have the energy to fight.
Comment 948.2	Fight as in really fight? That&#39;s sheer stupidity. Don&#39;t you know you will never win over the establishment? They&#39;re the ones with the soldiers, police and weapons. You&#39;re just spouting because you&#39;re angry.
Comment 948.3	What will you do??? You cant go against the laws made by democratically elected parliament... its British not EU parliament. So wait for elections to get a new parliament. Remember you just got one vote.. period. Dont get carried away by emotions... just live your life happily..
Comment949	The PEOPLE decided. Why all these votations? People demanded for BREXIT. Just DELIVER!!!
Comment 949.1	@Navaz SultanaliMy arithmetic is simply the facts, make of them what you will. 30% of all UK voters is not a majority and doesn&#39;t represent the people as a whole, so don&#39;t pretend it does to further your own agenda. Saying &#39;People Decided&#39; is not a true statement, and a very weak argument when presented with the facts and numbers of the actual vote. I personally don&#39;t care either way if it&#39;s deal, no deal , stay , don&#39;t stay , I don&#39;t personally care 100 percent genuinely and seriously. The damage caused by EU laws on this country&#39;s economy and immigration and general population is too high to be undone and fixed at this point.<br />How is EU retrograde , 14 of its 28 country&#39;s are nucleur powered and over the next 20 years them 14 country&#39;s are estimated to experience huge economic development and growth due to the money saved by not buying oil from other country&#39;s. How is EU retrograde, give me facts numbers and an example.
Comment 949.2	@drew woods Really? Who asked you about deals? The question was yes or not leave the EU. So don&#39;t be so pathetic! Because everyone knows that you&#39;re not a Yes Brexit voter. Please the world is full of hypocrites as you now. I know that you leftist are all very indignated due the People voted to Leave. Period!
Comment 949.3	I voted leave but I didn&#39;t vote for a no deal Brexit . I didn&#39;t mind either May or Boris&#39;s deal its kind of what I expected .
Comment 949.4	@Edward Russell people decided to leave. Period. October 31st bye bye blue and stars flag. EU is a retrograde place. I&#39;ll Party with my friends. Come and enjoy too. Otherwise you&#39;ll REMAIN unhappy.
Comment 949.5	@Yozza Hughes 31st October. We&#39;re leaving. I&#39;ll party. We&#39;re leaving the communist EU. Your arithmetic is now useless. People decided. Brexit is to deliver!
Comment950	The official opposotion lead by a a man older thans gods dog with late onset dementia. Never to <br />Lead this country  a puppet for the  marxists union leaders behind him.
Comment 950.1	@drew woods the difference is corbyn went to uni joined the student union became a commy activist and never got a job. Trump on the other hand is a self made multi millionaire from his multi national hotel and leasure complexes that he built with thousands of employees. Corbyn can&#39;t even manage his own thoughts. A life long bexiteer who has now been told he is a remainer limited to reading statements others in the party have given to him as he can&#39;t string two words together.
Comment 950.2	Hes three years younger than Donald Trump someone who Boris Johnson is looking to secure a post Brexit trade deal with and ten years younger than Churchill ( Boris Johnson&#39;s Hero ) when he left the office of Prime Minister .
Comment951	The BBC will have to redo this report they blocked out the EU Flag behind the reporter!!!
Comment 951.1	Gammon alert
Comment952	No deal is better than a bad deal. Borris&#39;s treaty is a very very bad deal, so no deal it is then. Just what the 17.4million people voted for originally then.
Comment953	I am German and I don&#39;t want Britain to leave the EU. I think it was absolutely wrong to hold a referendum about such a difficult question in the first place. And I wasn&#39;t happy at all about the outcome of the referendum. <br />But the British voters decided with a majority (according to the rules agreed on before) that they want to leave the European Union. Is it not that a democratic vote should be accepted?<br />It took almost a year before article 50, the official request to leave was triggered. It started a 2 year transition period and after that Brexit should take place.<br />Well, we all know the mess in the UK, no agreement about the conditions could be found within the UK, so Theresa May asked for an extension until 31 October. That date is approaching fast.<br />Still, the political system can&#39;t find an agreement on the terms of how everything should happen.  <br />So, the British government would have to send another official request for another delay. There is no need to agree on that from the European side. But, of course I think it&#39;s in the interest of the eu to be generous. And so, Europe says &quot;we will grant an extension if you ask for it&quot; <br />And what happens then? 3 letters arrive. Letter 1 from the British government but not signed by the PM, asking for an extension. Letter 2, signed by Boris saying letter 1 isn&#39;t what I want, I don&#39;t want an extension. Letter 3 from the British  ambassador saying letter 1 was only sent because the law required it.<br />This is absolutely insane! It&#39;s not Europe&#39;s job to decide what Britain wants. We don&#39;t play the game pick and choose. <br />Yes, no, no, yes, yes but not like that, ok, agreement but some time later...ah...can we negotiate again? Ok. Another agreement and again, yes, no, maybe, yes but we need more time. So I ask for more time but actually I don&#39;t want more time. I only ask for it because I am forced to do it.<br />What on earth is this? Seriously, please make a decision. This is laughable and nothing else!<br />Since I was in the UK first some 30 years ago, I really like that country. I have been there very often. It really bothers me what&#39;s happening. But to be frank, this all has to stopp. God damn it, make a decision!
Comment 953.1	@C Laws Thanks for your permission to seek further inquiry however, it is not required. Any attempt to seek the moral high ground regarding truthfulness - or abiding by the rule of law - from the leave cabal is more than a tad ironic. Just ask the monarch...
Comment 953.2	@John Glyn Hughes The 3electoral commission has since had to withdraw claims of law breaking and pay costs to one of their accused leave groups founders. The electoral commission has also recently found that two remain organisations used shell organisations to sub divide funds to allow them to overspend while appearing to be in the limit. The result was that they overspent by more than double the permitted amount. And all of that doesn&#39;t even take in the 9 million pound free boost to remain when the UK government sent pro remain leaflets to every house in the nation.<br /><br />If you are going to accuse someone of lying to people, tell the whole story, or you just appear to be another liar.<br /><br />You may now go and research vote remains breaches and post your outrage at their cheating. I will wait.
Comment 953.3	@C Laws Show me evidence that &#39;Leaving the single market&#39; was mentioned as a part of Vote Leave, prior to the referendum. <br /><br />Like I said, you&#39;re full of revisionist history.
Comment 953.4	​@Keep It Real &quot;Hard Brexit&quot; is a term invented by remainers to try and mitigate the result after they lost the referendum. The fact that you are using it here to try and appear clever shows the bias leaking from your post. People voted to leave the EU, which was stated at the time to mean exiting the single market, the customs union and the ECJ jurisdiction. Those have since been decreed to be &quot;hard Brexit&quot; by muppets like yourself, and the liars you vote for. So yes, people did vote for the things you like to pretend they never imagined when they put their X next to the leave option.
Comment 953.5	@C Laws I&#39;m sorry, you&#39;re so smart. I should have known that you already knew that voting Leave equated to a Hard Brexit, even though that was never on the agenda in the run-up to the referendum.<br /><br />How did you know that this was about a hard brexit, when Farage, Johnson and Davis said otherwise? <br /><br />You know a lot, you do. You&#39;re wasted on a YouTube comments section - You should be the the one conducting negotiations with the EU! <br /><br />Thank you for addressing my points in the previous post. That&#39;s what led me to understand that you knew all along what you were voting for - Even though everyone else was told otherwise. <br /><br />How did you come to this clever resolution?
Comment954	Comedy gold
Comment955	The people screaming throughout the segment is so irritating.
Comment 955.1	@looes74 looes74 The UK is the fifth largest economy in the world because it has innovative industry, advanced research, it is a major financial hub and still has a modicum of industry that manufactures and exports. it also has 66 million people who buy things from all over the world. The UK was as wealthy before the EU existed, and before it joined the EEC.<br /> Why do I have to explain this to you? Are you so uninformed as to not understand basic economics and history of the UK? if that is the case it begs the question of how you can say such utter nonsense as &quot;England is dead once Brexit happens&quot;. <br />God you are embarrassing yourself now. Stop talking.
Comment 955.2	Even the BBC microphones are left wing.
Comment 955.3	I rather like the surreal effect it gives. Gives the brexit-show its edge
Comment 955.4	It’s the Labour fangirls
Comment 955.5	Why doesn’t somebody arrest this screaming numbskull who tries to override everything that is being said by the broadcasters.surely he must be breaking some law,<br />Being a public nuisance making too much noise in a public place..<br />Who is he?<br />Why isn’t he at work?<br />Where does he get lunch?<br />Or use the toilet?<br />.He is there in place 24 hours a day,please get rid of this pest along side,any body else making a fool of themselves and more importantly making a fool of the UK
Comment956	The treaty is total crap and the will of the UK people is still not being carried out.
Comment 956.1	Apologies.<br />Like a committed Brexiteer I can&#39;t spell Yuck for Fuck.
Comment 956.2	Name Surname<br />YUK!
Comment 956.3	@Gordon Welford No point being arsed to vote if your judgment is based on lies and ignorance.
Comment 956.4	You mean the will of brainwashed, lied to, narrow-minded, UK people. The good thing is the EU is dealing with this perfectly, looking strong as a block, and the UK is making a fool of itself.
Comment 956.5	What Treaty? Do you mean the Lisbon Treaty? 🤣🤣  If the will of the people was more like 60%- 70% perhaps leaving could have been easier, but 17.4 million being only 33% and now a huge number that now want Remain since 2016 since the general public discovered the lies and disinformation of the Leave campaigns. <br />People have genuine concerns that they were manipulated to vote for Leave, now they want their votes back and another chance to vote again on the agreement that the Government secures to withdraw from the EU.
Comment957	Tourette’s?
Comment958	M.P.s of ALL parties having to be given an escort from Parliament. This matter needs to come to the conclusion we the people voted for otherwise it is becoming obvious what is likely to start happening.
Comment959	No Democracy in this country, I am waiting for GE
Comment960	Want to know a secret ...... There  never was a deal to be had... ever, everything has been orchestrated to delay and remain.<br />We will see what happens on the 31st but  when the general election comes the conservatives and labour are doomed. Brexit party will take Parliament by storm.
Comment 960.1	@Drake Hound Analytica polls and high jacked data? Try YouGov. Really, you probably need to take a break from politics, it brings out the deep state conspiracy theorist in you.<br />The lib dems are not going to get everyone that voted remain to vote lib dem. For one thing, the lib dems are untrustworthy slime and people still recall the tuition fees promise. For another, a third of remain voters actually support democracy over getting their own way. <br />People will vote with their usual parties as they usually do for the most part.
Comment 960.2	@C Laws I don´t care about your analytica polls. or high jacked data.<br />I only know they need to get 16 million that is that. so if people want to remain they vote Liberal Democrats. the rest can vote whatever they want.
Comment 960.3	@Drake Hound The lib dems couldn&#39;t get 16 million of anything together. Their revoke article 50 pledge actually came just before they began a sustained drop in the polls. The Lib dems are dreaming, Labour will still be the opposition and all polls consistently show a Tory government after a general election, only the size or lack of a majority differs there.
Comment 960.4	@C Laws You first get the 17.4 million together. Lib Dems only need to get the 16 million and they are done. <br />17.4 are divided as F infact brexit party couldn´t even get 5 million this time.
Comment 960.5	The opinion polls say differently. The BP are polling similar to the lib dems, and unlikely to even get a single MP due to first past the post.
Comment961	"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dissolveparliament"">#dissolveparliament</a> let the people decide how to move forward"
Comment 961.1	With a GE not another referendum.
Comment962	So, he broke the law by not signing and the court reprisal on Monday will decide what to do with him, and  probably decide to delegate a signatory who can apologise that we have such a self-serving arse for a PM.
Comment 962.1	@Grey Wolf I stopped reading your bullshit at line one again, because its pure fiction. The fact that a sad little wank stain remoaner on youtube chooses not to believe that the Prime minister and parliament of the UK has the authority to allow the people a free and binding vote on Brexit, does not in any way make it true. you are a liar, and a hypocrite, and apparently so mentally challenged that you just keep typing the same fairy story over and over. Brexit will happen no matter your whining, you may leave the Uk that you loathe at any time. Should the disappointment of not being able to force the rest of us to live under EU control for ever be to much, sleeping tablets are readily available and you absolutely wont be missed.
Comment 962.2	@C Laws It isn&#39;t the agreement of Parliament unless there has been a proper vote on the matter.<br /><br />When I first heard about these &#39;votes&#39; that MPs were referring to I scoured Hansards looking to find when Parliament had got together to &#39;decide&#39; that the referendum should be treated as binding.  Only to find that it <b>never</b> happened.  They were talking about individual conference votes and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s certain that every party had such a vote.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t found a moment in Parliament where every party assembled and agreed to treat the referendum as binding.  I am fairly certain no such record exists.<br /><br />All that is there is reference to individual party conference votes to &#39;respect&#39; the outcome of the referendum, which<br />a) Were made before the Cambridge Analytica/AIQ scandal was exposed,<br />b) Made before the Tories tried to exclude Parliament from involvement in interpreting the referendum outcome and<br />c) Made before the pitiful size of the Leave majority was known.<br /><br />You &#39;respect&#39; the outcome of an advisory referendum by discussing it, not by treating it as a binding mandate.  You &#39;respect&#39; the outcome of an illegally interfered with referendum by throwing out the result, prosecuting the culprits and holding another referendum.  And you &#39;respect&#39; the result of a referendum that proposes constitutional change, which produces a statistically insignificant result in favour of that change, by holding another referendum (or voting on an agreed threshold and applying it).<br /><br />And millions of us have already lost our trust in the UK&#39;s democratic process.  Because we have been excluded on the basis of a knobbled vote in a manufactured referendum <b>manipulated by a far right cabal embedded within the Conservative party.</b>  So the damage has already been done.
Comment 962.3	@Grey Wolf it DOES matter, because when the head of the UK government, acting on behalf of the executive, and with the agreement of parliament declares that the decision on a certain matter is being deferred to the pubic, it effectively passes sovereignty on that matter to said public. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING that you are rambling on about changes that fact. Further more, nothing you are demanding changes the reality that trust in the UKs democratic process would be irreparably damaged by any effort to hold another vote without first implementing the last one.<br />Finally, there remains that awkward fact that like the rest of the die hard remoaners, you personally would be arguing the vote was the word of god had it gone your way. Yes you would.<br />You can have all the votes you want about it after we leave. Leaving the EU is not irreversible, so what the hell is your problem with just leaving and then campaigning to rejoin if it doesn&#39;t work out well in a few years? Go on, tell us a fairy story bout protecting workers rights, and pretend its not the rantings of a petulant CHILDISH individual who cant and wont accept that they don&#39;t get what they want.<br />You are pathetic. Stop talking now, because I&#39;m bored with your nonsense.
Comment 962.4	@C Laws It doesn&#39;t matter what was &#39;declared&#39;.  If you look into Parliamentary records none of it was made law and the only legal decision made in Parliament regarding the referendum was that it would be advisory.<br /><br />It doesn&#39;t matter what politicians say in Parliament, even if the vote on it; unless they ratify it into an Act of Parliament, it is non-binding and potentially meaningless.<br /><br />And If I was aware of the type of shenanigans perpetrated by the Leave campaign having been employed by Remain campaigners, no I would not be supporting it.  But the result would be the same, the referendum would be declared null and void; just as it should have been when Vote Leave/Leave.EU&#39;s illegal activity was exposed.   Then we could have had a properly protected legal referendum with the perpetrators banned from further interference.
Comment 962.5	@C Laws You missed my point by a long shot and in a very condecending way, i might add. Anyway if mister Johnson is such a great guy who works so much to deliver Brexit and honour the referendum, let me ask you this:<br />Why did he vote no for Mays deal?
Comment963	Dear  Mr Tusk ,<br />                            Please excuse Bojo for not handing in his project  today. He lost his pen is , trying to find it but thinks he left it in his girlfriend &#39;s little cubby hole . He would like an extension but I&#39;ve told him and I&#39;m sure you will agree not to reply to those sort of e-mails . He has promised me he will try his best to get it in next week but his friends have been teasing him about not being up to the job. He knows it&#39;s impotent though and will just have take himself in hand .<br />     Yours most insincerely   , Electile  Dysfunction
Comment964	Awwhhh the BBC letting the heckler in the back shout anti brexit slogans, awhh isnt that sweet of them?
Comment 964.1	Tin foil hat alert
Comment965	The E U doesn&#39;t blame the British people for Brexit. They think we are brain washed.
Comment 965.1	Because most people are. The Tories blamed the EU for austerity for YEARS. And people were stupid enough to believe them!
Comment966	&quot;Are you in favour of sandwiches or no sandwiches?&quot; - &quot;Sandwiches! For sure! I love sandwiches!&quot; - &quot;Excellent! Shit Sandwiches from now on every day!&quot; - &quot;Wait! I didn&#39;t know we&#39;re talking about SHIT sandwiches!&quot; - &quot;Too bad, the people have spoken! We must deliver the shit sandwiches! Get the shit sandwiches done! Get it done! Open up!&quot;
Comment967	The people voted the government said no.. do you in the UK feel like sheep yet?   you should.......
Comment 967.1	@Freebird Well that&#39;s called democracy, people vote for what they believe is best for them and the country..And people voted by a majority to leave..
Comment 967.2	@mhffc i&#39;m sorry the people voted to leave... do try to keep up and be free.. SMH
Comment 967.3	@Freebird The Government didn&#39;t say no. The opposition backed by some Tory MP&#39;s are blocking it..Do keep up..
Comment 967.4	@Oli Cansdale umm you as a people voted to leave.  Stop lying you voted to leave as a nation.  Your Government said no.  You are a bunch of sheep now.  This proves it....
Comment 967.5	We had a general election since then, most MPs voted in do not want no deal.
Comment968	Looks good to me. Lol. <br /><br />- Tusk.
Comment 968.1	Ted Crilly but I just erm did.
Comment 968.2	Should *have*.  <br />*Have*. Not &quot;of&quot;.
Comment 968.3	Brexiters know we should of left in 2016. The remainers are traitors who have shafted the democratic majority.
Comment 968.4	Who are brexiters after brexit?   <br />A bino will split them. Or at least kill off that 1.9% lead. <br />Then you have two minorities. <br /><br />Getting the throne is one thing. <br />Keeping it is another.
Comment969	I can hear the famous &quot;Steve&quot;, who cries out &quot;No Brexit&quot;, outside parliament all the time, who turns out to be a paid actor, who&#39;s real name is Dave Allen. Bought and paid for by the Remainer establishment...
Comment970	Do not worry about his signature... His DNA is all over it!
Comment971	They will know the letter is off Johnson, if it’s turned to shit then he touched it.
Comment972	Why is it that, as interesting as this is. That I living in Canada, the weekend before the vote. Am not being shown the issues at all on Canadian issues. Seems strange...don&#39;t it?<br />The Big Lie is that things will change. It never changes for anyone. Anywhere.<br />Everywhere.
Comment 972.1	@William Peddle love it!
Comment 972.2	@Wendy Follett &quot;I met a girl who sang the blues,<br />asked her for some happy news.<br />But she just smiled and turned away<br /> So I went down to the sacred store, where I&#39;d heard the music, years before, but the man there said the music wouldn&#39;t play<br />And in the streets the children scream Lovers cry and Poets dream.<br />Yet not a word is spoken The church bells all been broken<br />And the three men I admire most<br />The Father Son and Holy Ghost well, they took the last train for the coast<br />the day<br />the music<br />died&quot;<br /><br /><br />Oh ya and    Right with ya baby! Manipulation is a topic for discussion.
Comment 972.3	Oh, it does change. The rich get richer, there&#39;s one change. The poor get poorer, there&#39;s another change. What is unbelievable, both in UK and USA, at the moment is that the poor actually voted to make themselves poorer. The rich have finally figured out how to manipulate!
Comment973	Boris Johnson not only didn&#39;t sign the letter requesting for an extension, he sent another letter recommending against the extension.  The court may come down on him again.
Comment 973.1	@Fu Alexander Read the first letter in clear trms he asks for aan extension, check Tusk&#39;s response, hes accepted a request for an extension, now how us brexiteers respond to this, is going to be key.
Comment 973.2	@A Nother He asked a civil servant to do it and he never signed it. Instead, he sent a second letter stating his rationale why there should be no extension.
Comment 973.3	@C Laws I voted to leave and dont like labour but i have to commend them for having an objective to disruupt and they did that successfully, not once but again and again, what they pulled off is like Extinction rebellion&#39;s wet dream, i dont agree with what they did but hats off to their game plan.
Comment 973.4	@A Nother You respect them for opposing the electorates wishes and trying to coerce the government to do the same? You may need to see a doctor about your brain trauma.
Comment 973.5	Hes asked for an extension and Dianne Abbott and Corbyn need respect, they slapped everyone about and won.
Comment974	So Bojo bent the knee and asked for an extension
Comment 974.1	Never bend the knee to a Lannister, I mean the EU.
Comment 974.2	@ᴅᴇᴀʀ ᴍʀ. ɪꜱᴀɪᴀʜ ᴅᴇʀɪɴɢᴇʀ; It makes no difference legally
Comment 974.3	@Stephanie Tihanyi That&#39;s rich, I suppose you are getting behind the 2016 referendum result then?
Comment 974.4	@Stephanie Tihanyi Take democracy from whom???
Comment 974.5	Depends. The fact that he didn&#39;t sign it isn&#39;t merely symbolical.
Comment975	Not one mention from Laura Kuenssberg on Plmt being given time to scrutinise the new deal. Why is everything always framed as to how it affects the PM or his agenda? We don’t care how it affects his ego, it’s how it affects our public services, our economy, our rights. Plmt is there to scrutinise.
Comment976	this man must not be taking seriously the whole brexit deal by senting an unsigned letter to the EU asking for an extension of time, just for future voting purposes and trying fooling the other 27 EU PM&#39;s granting an extension of time to an unsigned request. That is not British at all. Rules are rules and you need to show some respect to the Union, the parliament and the people. He is such a tactician disreputating the whole of UK. Nobody is above the law.
Comment977	Why do they continue to do these at parliament where some goon can be on TV for all to see for no good reason
Comment 977.1	John...um....&quot;see&quot;?
Comment978	THE QUEEN SAID WE ARE OUT ON THE 31ST  there even trying to ignore her &gt;&gt;&gt;But we left on the 29th of march anyways so why we having all this bs and why are we the people not going to parliament and ripping the people government out of that place &gt;&gt;&gt;The government serve the people not the other way round if you do not want to serve the people go serve at  burger king flipping burgers&gt;&gt;&gt;ONE other thing is when we vote soon again lets see how many mps loose there seats &gt;&gt;&gt;WHAT PART OF OUT DOES THIS GOVERNMENT AND THE EU UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE VOTED OUT &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;GET READY FOR  WW111
Comment979	If No.10 didn’t sign the delay request sent to the EU, he broke the law. Parliament voted to delay as the Brexit ‘plan’ was a rough draft; hastily hashed together. Thus 322 aye. 306 nay. Northern Ireland &amp; Scotland; Labour &amp; Environment agreed that the plan would harm. The EU will understand the request. They too noted that the plan was/is still half-baked.
Comment 979.1	glyn hodges “Not never, just not yet..” Agreed it wasn’t a vote to end Brexit. The deal isn’t ready. The EU has said as much. HRH, citizens, Parliament.. markets worldwide want the deal done.
Comment 979.2	It was a plan endorsed and created with the EU.   And they did not actually vote today on the deal, they voted on the Letwin ammendment.  There are those who voted for the Letwin ammendment who have said that they would, in fact, vote for the deal - Letwin himself is one of those.
Comment980	Wish people would stop shouting in the background.
Comment 980.1	That&#39;s Parliment.
Comment981	Wise words from Theresa May
Comment982	How about we just leave cleanly like we all voted for 1200 days ago!!!!!!
Comment 982.1	Byron JONES you must be a politician
Comment 982.2	No
Comment983	cant wait for an election all libtards will pay u will see 🖕🙂🖕
Comment984	British MPs with police escorts, big message.
Comment 984.1	Trump&#39;s rally in Texas had no Antifa unusually. Guess Soros flew them to London to scare the pansies in Parliament
Comment985	Well, I agree with Boris on one thing. For what purpose should there be a delay?<br />There is NONE! Parliment will NEVER agree on anything besides wanting extentions for the next eternity....
Comment 985.1	@swave158 nobody taught him how to make an &#39;X&#39;
Comment 985.2	Parliament would agree on a better deal (outside of EU membership) than the current deal we enjoy inside of membership; which is what the Leave campaign manifesto promised we would get within 5 minutes if we just voted &#39;leave&#39;. That of course was a lie! That is why Parliament cannot agree on a deal that is inferior to what full membership will guarantee us in trade. But Brexiteers still don&#39;t f#@kin get it through their neanderthal skulls...
Comment 985.3	@Tyrone Power Your right there, they run off to other countries instead. <br />If that cap fits wear it.
Comment 985.4	Remainers don&#39;t even know why they want an extension.. just they know they don&#39;t like democracy
Comment986	&gt;people voted yes to Brexit<br />&gt;We want another vote<br />&gt;People vote yes or no to Brexit<br />&gt;Losing side wants another vote<br />&gt;Etcetc
Comment987	What a bunch of posh traitors we voted to leave for christ sake  you remoaners need to get over it and stop adding another nail in the coffin of democracy it&#39;s been 3 bloody years if it was the shoe on the other foot leavers wouldnt have as much coverage also doesn&#39;t help when the speaker is a remainer, labour and lib dems are always changing their minds on brexit to get votes
Comment988	AWWWWWWW DA
Comment989	Bye bye Eu 😂😂😂
Comment990	Lol wwe and the funny part is that most people can’t see it 😂
Comment991	To vote against a deal and against no deal is to vote against Brexit entirely. And I&#39;m sorry but the decision of Brexit was given to the people, not to the stinking labour party or lib dems. It was our decision, your decision, my decision, and those parties are pissing all over us.
Comment992	Brexit start on 1 nov, most people will regret it.
Comment 992.1	Wrong. Most people want it. Stop being an undemocratic sore loser.
Comment993	kick them out E.U
Comment 993.1	You can leave anytime guys (no deal). You just have to say: I am quit NOW.
Comment 993.2	Can u help way that
Comment 993.3	Whatever country you&#39;re from please ask them to kick us out..
Comment 993.4	Please do.
Comment994	General election will sort these “representatives” out .
Comment 994.1	@English Grammar most countries without a president operate that way. In fact most of the EU operates that way.
Comment 994.2	Ras Keisar have not met one individual who fits that description
Comment 994.3	@Ras Keisar No I think the polls prove the opposite, more people have changed to leave!
Comment 994.4	@English Grammar Well said a two party system sounds great. They could be the Conservatives and the Brexit party and we could dissolve the rest of the remoaning dead weights that are holding us up!!!!
Comment 994.5	We have seen a lot of bad situations since the brexit vote. Most of us would change our mind to remain.
Comment995	Get rid of Corbyn, he is nothing but trouble and the idiot MPs will change their mind after wondering who is going next.  In a GE Labour will lose.  People are really fed up and MPs must be prepared for any form of trouble and Boris is the man to give it them.
Comment 995.1	You said ut. &quot;Trouble&quot; it&#39;s what he knows
Comment996	Please report catalonia thank you.
Comment997	Tusk should have sent the both letters back post haste and required immediate clarification by letter. This slippery Etonian 5th form prank will not play well with those parliamentarians who already distrust Johnson.
Comment 997.1	@adscri No amount of reading will in any way justify 80% of MPs making a false manifesto pledge to get elected. I strongly suggest you do some reading on how democracy works, and stop excusing those currently subverting it. I also suggest that you DONT vote ever again, because your moral compass  is as broken as that of the people you are excusing. Very sad.
Comment 997.2	Le Sigh Strongly suggest you do some reading on just how the UK constitution functions and has done so for over 400 years. You clearly have absolutely no clue, even though entitled to vote. Very sad.
Comment 997.3	@adscri 80% of them lied to get elected and promised they would deliver Brexit. They have zero legitimacy, and now there is a no majority government and its a functionally dead parliament, they have a moral obligation to submit to an election. You can pretend they are representing the people, but recent polls show around two thirds to three quarters of the public disagree.<br /><br />its not even surprising how you oil and slime away from your original assertion that Boris is unfit, to excuse parliaments grotesque behaviour. You are so depressingly typical of the remoaner quisling.
Comment 997.4	Le Sigh Until an election has been held, like it or not this parliament represents the will of the people. Sending out an unsigned letter in Her Majesty’s name is an abomination.
Comment 997.5	That&#39;s okay though, because the slippery school room pranks of the MPs trying to further delay Brexit wont sit well with the electorate, as the polls clearly are showing.<br />They spent all month whining that we must avoid a no deal Brexit, against the odds the Govt agreed a fresh deal that the EU supports, and the same MPs wont even vote on it.
Comment998	The EU must be so sick of “will they or won’t” that they’ll probably kick Britain out the EU, themselves!
Comment 998.1	I Doubt it thay want are money
Comment999	Barmy Boris buggers it.
Comment1000	The SNP are so bitter they lost their referendum.
Comment 1000.1	The SNP are still bitter about losing the battle of Culloden.
Comment 1000.2	Scotland voted to stay in the EU.
Comment1001	As ever, classic bias by the BBC showing only remain protestors and representatives. Before our eyes, UK democracy dies a death of many cuts.
Comment 1001.1	@ThePierre58 no it does not,dont peddle falsehoods.
Comment 1001.2	Mark Monroe bbc gets funds from the Eu...
Comment 1001.3	@Mark Monroe Well I suspect your gutter mind went to BDSM with Hu Edwards, but don&#39;t assume I was implying the same.
Comment 1001.4	@ThePierre58 No it doesn&#39;t.
Comment 1001.5	@Mark Monroe Be in no doubt, since the referendum result the BBC is overwhelmingly pro remain. For quite a long time it gave up all pretence of being impartial, it was like watching some communist state TV, so much so I stopped watching for a long time, because it annoyed me so much. Now it is trying but failing very badly.<br />All the old tricks wheel out, remainers would &quot;state&quot;, or &quot;say&quot;, leavers would only &quot;claim&quot; etc.
Comment1002	UK, we are leaving, EU okay where are you going ?
Comment1003	Stop giving extension then its much more easier for EU.
Comment 1003.1	@Oli Cansdale I mean what I wrote not some remainers dream. A lot of our MPs are going against their constituencies wishes.
Comment 1003.2	@imdbist you mean passed by our representatives.
Comment 1003.3	@glyn hodges you mean passed by traitors.
Comment 1003.4	It is entirely up to the EU now whether they grant an extension or not.  Boris was forced to send the letter by a bill passed by remainers.
Comment1004	Oh why don&#39;t you stay, just a little bit longer...  The union don&#39;t mind....
Comment 1004.1	@parc m ha ha ha - I was right - an actual moron
Comment 1004.2	​ Pendasshole, the sooner you&#39;re out of the 500 million peoples market, the better. You contribute just shit anyway.
Comment 1004.3	@parc m moron - we contribute more than we receive - meanwhile countries with less debt to GDP receive more than they contribute.
Comment 1004.4	@Pendle Eldnep Do you mean those 300000 per week Farage had promised? And didn&#39;t exist?
Comment 1004.5	They will if we don&#39;t pay more than we get back.
Comment1005	People voted for this years ago and now they&#39;re saying they can&#39;t do it? So much for democracy in that country lol
Comment1006	I&#39;m not sure these letters matter much if they are unsigned by the pm. Regardless of whom they are from, if they are not properly notarized they are just scraps of paper.
Comment1007	It seems their prime minister went right past red/blue straight to orange.
Comment 1007.1	Any more orange and he will even start looking like Donald Trump .
Comment1008	Your parliament members are a joke, just look at them. You people are spitting on Johnson, but he’s the best of the bunch
Comment 1008.1	Hear hear
Comment1009	This tv serie is so good, that they won&#39;t cancel so easily. New chapter? Comming soon!
Comment 1009.1	So sad that Bercow won’t be casted on the next season 😔
Comment 1009.2	except like certain TV shows, it&#39;s running out of good material and there&#39;s a feeling that the execs are just milking it for all it&#39;s worth.<br /><br />Should have ended a few seasons ago
Comment 1009.3	@Drake Hound  They are all the same , The politicians nowdays are just there for themselves.
Comment 1009.4	we still have trump (endgame)
Comment 1009.5	it gives on giving doesn´t it :D all in real time. couple hours back NOBODY WILL COMPEL ME TO ASK FOR A EXTENSION....<br />Bojo asked for a extension but didn´t sign it. cause he is childishe. <br />Really good drama on a saturday, good show and entertainment.
Comment1010	How can ANYBODY still vote Tory after these shamefull displays?
Comment 1010.1	The tories have been puppeteered by the law passed by the remainer parliament.
Comment 1010.2	Rj problem is that no party in parliament is representative of the people
Comment1011	<b>So no Brexit GREAT.</b><br /><b>Boris = Donald Trump</b>
Comment1012	ordaaaaaahhhh!!!
Comment1013	😂😂😂
Comment1014	Please UK LEAVE THE EU NO ONE LIKE YOU AND NO ONE WANT YOU! LEAVE!!!!!!!!!!!
Comment1015	It&#39;s a disgrace the 2016 vote simply being ignored by MPs and those who want to remain people who voted knew exactly what they voted for whether it was leave or remain even if we had another 10 referendums these MPs will never accept the vote unless they got what they wanted they are giving  the UK a very bad reputation simply because they cannot go ahead with 17.4 million people who want to leave
Comment 1015.1	@Andrew Rainbow Here&#39;s hoping, though I would bet folding money that the EU commission will grant an extension to January.
Comment 1015.2	Le sigh totally agree the way the remain MPs are going about it more people want Brexit to happen and hopefully the 31st we will be out
Comment 1015.3	@Ff Yy Sorry to disappoint you, but recent polls show around a third of remain voters from last time now want Brexit to happen for the sake of democracy. Vile scum like you gleefully wishing peoples grandmas to die really doesn&#39;t help the remainer cause either.
Comment 1015.4	A high % of the 17.4M have already gone to paradise... or maybe hell.
Comment1016	THE EU should just kick us out now say you taken too long good bye enjoy no deal
Comment 1016.1	@glyn hodges i agree with you. If I would ever dream to be a politician on this planet, I would be a UK Tory. They always had a clear sight regarding EU. <br /><br />Even if one can complain for &quot;changing the rules during the game&quot; , you can not pass the responsability of UK leaders to the EU. Therefore, if it might have been stolen as we discuss, those who had the power to protect were following some other line of interest and they should be the ones answering the questions. There are always ways to bribe or fool the gatekeeper but then he should answer for this acusations. <br /><br />Also, you can not deny that in nowadays macro economic behaviour, the ideea of solidarity under the EU flag, makes much more sense then divided small countries. A united and monolitic Europe is a better protagonist on a global scale today next to USA, Russia  or China. It is a realistic and worthy vision. I, personaly prefere the alternative of variety and relatively independent states working together. But I can bot blame the EU for aiming at more unity. I hate it, I hate the evergrowing left, I hate the cultural massacre happening, I hate the grey as a standard of living, I think UK does a great job defending it&#39;s culture and values...but I think freedom demands sacrifice. And if yoy guys have the power to break free, you should go all the away, without blaiming EU at all. You guys can be great again but do it as masters of your own path without arguing about EU methods to undermine soverenty - it sounds more as a reaction then a decission.
Comment 1016.2	@Tudor Tomescu Back in 1973 there was a previous British referendum on membership of the EEC.  It passed easily.  The same people who voted for that are now voting against.  <br /> Our government told us the EEC was a trading club and involved no transfer of sovereignty ever.  But it is no longer the EEC.  Further treaties were signed without the approval of the public - Maastricht and Lisbon.   It is now the EU and that has very clear political ambitions.  We did not sign up for that.<br /> Yes it was given away freely but it was given away by temporary politicians who had no right to do so without consulting the British people.  In that sense I would say it was stolen (by our own politicians for their own purposes).
Comment 1016.3	@glyn hodges i know what you mean I partly agree with Brexit. I am EU citizen and I am sad UK leaves and I also agree with most of the reasons. But things were on papper, power was not stolen. It was actually given, willingly...and the problem is that EU government should do things differently for it&#39;s culture and citizens
Comment 1016.4	@Tudor Tomescu &#39;as long as damage is avoided&#39;.  That can mean whatever you like.  I wonder which elected government will be the first to be denied power because of the potential &#39;damage that must be avoided&#39;.<br /> Oh, actually, the the EU has interfered in countries and removed ministers already to be replaced by their approved persons.  Step by step.
Comment 1016.5	@glyn hodges doesn&#39;t work like that. It is UK who voted to go without being able to handle the outcome. EU position can only be :&quot;fine, as long as damage is avoided...welcome to stay or go&quot;
Comment1017	Letter 1:<br />&quot;Dear Frogs, Krauts, etc,<br />Give us an extension to Brexit, you tossers.<br />Up yours,<br />[            ]&quot;<br />Letter 2:<br />&quot;Dear European Friends,<br />Kindly ignore Letter 1.<br />Yours sincerely,<br />Boris&quot;<br />lol
Comment 1017.1	@Mojo hard to tell or hard to stop yourself getting butthurt when you see something you think you dont like
Comment 1017.2	@Mojo ; ¬)
Comment 1017.3	@Truth &amp; Justice Ah fair enough. I&#39;m so used to seeing xenophobic anti European comments on Brexit videos its hard to tell these days.
Comment 1017.4	"@LOLquendoTV Ta, LOLquendoTV! ; ¬)"
Comment 1017.5	@Manuel Müller Well, the situation is <i>disbelievable.</i> lol
Comment1018	That’s why I don’t mind boris at this point. He’s stubborn and will do what needs to be done. It just needs to be done with now.
Comment1019	Hahahahaha and here you go again. Britain govt can&#39;t even execute their public&#39;s mandate in last almost 4 years.
Comment1020	Where is the ditch?
Comment1021	i never heard so much noise in the background of a news video in my life jesus it gone insane there
Comment 1021.1	Collective Emperor - The ERG go nuts after a few drinks, but worse than usual.
Comment1022	Lose your stamps borris dirty snowflakes
Comment1023	They should put the deal to the head of state and ask her to decide yes or no and accept her decision. Otherwise why have a head of state?
Comment 1023.1	@Königstiger Your not british by making a comment such as that!
Comment 1023.2	You must not be British if you even consider putting her majesty in position to make political decisions
Comment1024	Why do the bbc always set up in view of these anti brexit supporters shouting at camera’s?<br />Could this be a cynical agenda by the bbc.....
Comment 1024.1	Aki Khairan bbc are remoaners we all know that!!!
Comment1025	which ditch is he in ?
Comment 1025.1	our europian union eh !
Comment1026	So now apart from being a loser cheat and a charlaton....he is a massive serial liar
Comment1027	Technically he was forced to ask for extension but still as of October 31st he says he will leave No Deal
Comment 1027.1	@hotblooded1983 so you actually want the EU to decide UK policy... I thought you wanted UK Parliamentary  sovereignty. Now you actually hope that the EU will quash the UK Parliament&#39;s actions!?!?! Are you the enemy within?
Comment 1027.2	@Charlie Alder stop listening to your brexit overlords
Comment1028	Corbyn: once again spouting stupid nonsense. All parliament proved is that&#39;s it&#39;s in the clutches of stupid, treacherous politicians bent on subverting democracy.<br />Of course, Corbyn is at heart a devotee of communist and other unsavoury regimes that pretend to be democratic.
Comment1029	And we expect these same politicians to successfully negotiate, with the international community if we leave the EU?! It’s been nearly 4 years and 3 prime ministers so far, possibly 4 if Corbyn takes over.
Comment1030	Someone please explain to me, why the resistance to brexit , ?? What’s  the deal here , I thought the people of UK Already voted on this .
Comment 1030.1	@Zain Hoda the clarity of the referendum is certain leave or remain, claims remain is an absolute and leave is a magnitude of different definitions is ridiculous and wether or not it was legal binding is a moot point as triggering article 50 put it into law. It&#39;s a denial of the people&#39;s will and those who are allowing because it benefits their stance now will feel the cost of it someday.
Comment 1030.2	@Zain Hoda Manifesto pledges aren&#39;t binding either. It&#39;s the same as if you had a presidential candidate that lied to get elected. It&#39;s the politicians&#39; fault for lying through their teeth about it, not people for not having something in place to force the politicians to hold their word (something which politicians, not the people, would have to put in place themselves)<br /><br /><br />Btw mate, we were told loads of times before the vote &quot;this is a once in a lifetime decision&quot; and they expressed many times that the referendum WOULD be binding..... they are just dragging their feet.
Comment 1030.3	Neal Rigga I don’t have a dog in this fight (I’m American). I’m just saying your referendum was not set up for success. It was basically a straw poll with no legally binding effect. That’s why referenda have to be on specific pieces of legislation that the people can pass directly, bypassing the legislature when there’s no legislative majority for something but there is popular majority. For example, in the US, most marijuana legalization gets passed by referenda because state senators don’t want to vote for legalization.
Comment 1030.4	"@DoubleDoubleYou&quot;. lol ... 51.9% are much closer to 1/2 than to 2/3.&quot;<br /><br /><br />You are getting confused because you don&#39;t know what a constituency is.<br /><br /><br /><br />406 constituencies voted to leave and 242 voted to remain.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://fullfact.org/online/referendum-results-by-constituency/"">https://fullfact.org/online/referendum-results-by-constituency/</a>"
Comment 1030.5	@Zain Hoda that&#39;s ridiculous the vote was to stay or leave the E.U. it wasn&#39;t abstract or unclear to anyone. All this what kind of deal did we want is nonsense.
Comment1031	Fuck leftie rremainers we are out on the 31st October.
Comment1032	Boris has spent so much of our public money on this failing Brexit campaign. He needs to grow up, get a good deal ( which is obviously possible) and finally take us out with a deal. If not, then he’s just wasting our public money and time where he could be prioritising the main issues in our country . Typical conservative who only cares about his own political career.
Comment1033	The break-up of Britain begins: Great Britain just got rid of Northern Ireland and Scotland actually wants what NI now has ... and that is out of GB and into the EU.
Comment 1033.1	LOL
Comment 1033.2	Jigsaw John<br />And why should anyone believe the kind of crap you spout?<br />Are you saying such people are stupid, remedial learners or just not capable logical reasoning?<br />Or are you calling such Brexiteers the salt of the Earth?
Comment 1033.3	transit journal<br />And what is your opinion on Catalunya escaping the fascists of Madrid.<br />Question mark.
Comment 1033.4	@Peregrine Slim Well your statement was a tad hyperbolic..
Comment1034	Mayday Mayday !
Comment1035	We will leave no matter what and with no deal. He who laughs last laughs the longest.
Comment 1035.1	Feel free...you could have left almost 4 yrs ago.
Comment1036	I want the UK to stay in the EU but at this point they are holding back the entire continent from progressing. Brexit has had center stage for years, the EU enlargement process could have been reformed by now instead Albania and North Macedonia will have to wait because brexit has taken all attention.<br />No more extensions, the rabid anti-EU sentiment in the UK won&#39;t go away. Its 40 years of tabloid brainwashing painting the EU as the enemy, maybe a total crash of their country will bring them back to reality.<br />Or if they extend then remove the ability for the UK to veto EU processes until they sort out their shitshow.
Comment 1036.1	@transit journal You don´t have to worry didn´t MERKEL say she could reform the EU in no time with only the founding countries including Spain?<br /><br /><br />That plan is always a option and every one of those country agreed to it.
Comment 1036.2	Well, maybe UK will do well after Brexit. <br />It will be interesting to watch the consequences.<br />I agree with you. UK wasted EU time and money....and is damaging European economy.<br />I wonder if there are already drafts for new rules how to handle exits on future.<br />And how to section countries who do not share EU burdens fairly.<br />I hope that there wont be any further EU expansion towards Eastern Europe.<br />The first enhancement was already a mistake. <br />It is too expensive and these extremely corrupt countries do not add value despite of cheap labor at the cost of locals and migration into our welfare system.<br />If USA wants the EU to accept these countries for geostrategically reasons, they can invite them to join the Nato directly...and pay for them.<br />Albania and Macedonia?! What a Nightmare!<br />If a small number of countries (not equaling corporations ...I refer to the tax payers) have to bear all cost and social burdens, EU doesn&#39;t make sense.  <br />We do not want to be the paymasters only. <br />We do not pay taxes without getting anything in return. It is not our aim to finance growth in other countries while the money is missing at home.<br />Obviously, it is the target to decrease our living standard and rise the standard of others to get one level in the EU. I don&#39;t think that it will be accepted to Transfer of Money, jobs and Know how to Eastern Europe and still to China, while we are still paying other peoples bills.<br />Brexit might be just the beginning.<br />Perhaps it is mandatory to abolish the EU in order to free the way for a new alliance of better selected and better matching partners with the same vision, values, targets and similar economic power.<br />Since the crisis in Greece, migration crisis, Chinas influences in EU, the rise of Trumpistan, right wingers and Brexit I doubt that the EU can be reformed like necessary.
Comment1037	Someone did spend a few quid on this campaign.. wonder who paid for all of this and the clean up after... hmm our hard earned tax.. bad enough it goes E.U don&#39;t worry we will clean there mess aswell
Comment 1037.1	???<br />The Brexit campaign was financed by US insurance companies, UHNWs, Hedge Fonds Managers etc. You can find the list of official donors online...inofficially there might be a few Russian oligarchs involved too.<br />EU will have to pay for the collateral damage caused by UK itself...like European companies that had to adjust business models and supply chains.<br /><br />Sorry, UK is no victim at all.
Comment1038	OOO...DDDDDDAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAA
Comment 1038.1	@MR Spoon Have you never heard of the EU Freedom of Movement act that allows members of the Union to reside in any member state of their choice?  Blair ripped our society apart far more than the Conservatives.
Comment 1038.2	Poor Barcow, he sounds a bit weary...
Comment 1038.3	@Matthijs Scaf haha. leuk
Comment 1038.4	@Vincent 79 Absolutely nothing to do with the EU . It was the Tories that decided the level of EU immigration ( all within their power) . The Tories have ripped societies apart and have used the EU to blame! The EU protects those workers rights, the ones the UK now wants to get rid off!
Comment 1038.5	@MrMudNugget baked
Comment1039	Good job Boris, first thing you done right for the country :)
Comment1040	What a mad lad
Comment1041	This mockery of the law by Johnson will undoubtedly end up in court.
Comment 1041.1	&quot;mockery&quot;? Seems to have complied with it to me. The letter was sent.
Comment1042	Please UK, remain in our European family
Comment 1042.1	UKSSR is undemocratic, corrupt and hostile to European countries. The  EU must be rid of it.
Comment 1042.2	@transit journal You don&#39;t understand that im not English or Scottish they are all Anglo Saxon much like the rest of the English speaking countries and most European countries we Celts have been slaughtered and tortured for thousands of years. This will be the second coming of us we are renowned warriors who will still be here after the shite has hit the fan and the only friends who understand us and will stand next to us in the holy war that will besieged the world is or judah friends who stand on the ground that was given to us by God
Comment 1042.3	I initially thought the same.<br />But UK proved to be no teamplayer at all.<br />They are opportunitic profiteers who do not share the EU vision and targets...and do not appreciate the benefits of an alliance.<br />The bad attitude, hostile behavior, all diese Trump alike lies and ignorance were shocking.<br />It is all about protecting die Money laundry Business in London City. The EU claims regulation of the criminal finance sector (remember the financial crisis triggered by Lehman and Greece, das Layers hat to Rescue these disgusting banks)<br />and tax justice. UHNWI and corporations have to Pay their fair share.<br />No tax pay, no Sales!<br />London City don&#39;t feed UK and the elites give a shit on the interests and needs of the people, as demonstrated.<br />Finally, EU doesn&#39;t agree with privatization if public Assets like die NHS, supports minimum workers rights and Stands for quality control and safety rules.<br />Yes, the EU is ruthless and evil.. it will be much better to live in US predator capitalism and neo facism.<br /><br />If people think so...<br />It might be better to continue without England.<br />Scotland is welcome.
Comment 1042.4	EU &lt;3 UK  Forever
Comment 1042.5	We been slaughtered by European institutions since the beginning of time it&#39;s about time for us to see all the Elements and dirty tricks my children wount have to live by your insult any more
Comment1043	Wtf no-one knew what they voted for! Now we do. A second referendum is now a must. Ffs Britain. Wake up! Johnson is a divider a traitor. A millionaire that doesn&#39;t have your best interests at heart. Let&#39;s have a informed referendum. So we can decide for ourselves.
Comment1044	Macron said he would veto an extension. Boris has satisfied the Benn Act by technically sending the letter. For all the concessions in this new deal, they might as well stay in the EU. They want to retain all the benefits and shed the unpopular rules. The world does not work like that. There is always a price for everything. He wants a free trade agreement with the EU, but with only UK advantaged rules. The EU won&#39;t accept that. Deluded.
Comment 1044.1	Oh and why would Macron veto this embarressement for Bojo.<br />He is probaly laughing called schadefreude... he has it bad with jacket protest.<br />But UK has it even worst .
Comment 1044.2	Smart comment

Comment1046	What an ignorant, arrogant man, and an embarrassment of a prime minister.
Comment 1046.1	@Mark Horton Er, all great points. But are you sure you meant to reply to my comment. I was replying to the original comment that called BJ arrogant..I&#39;m a Leaver...
Comment 1046.2	​@mhffc 1. We were taken into the EU without ANY electoral permission by way of referendum or manifesto. Powers of Law making and Governance were signed over to a foreign organisation.<br /><br /><br />2. Calls for a referendum were blocked and denied for many years.<br /><br /><br />3. To stop the rise of UKIP BOTH main parties promised referendums, BOTH were elected to power on those promises, BOTH reneged on the promises when they realised what the result would be. Such is their contempt for democratic process, the electorate and their lack of morals.<br /><br /><br />4. ONLY when after a quarter of a century, and polls showed a comfortable win for remain, were we finally allowed a say in who rules over us and who we pay taxes to. <br /><br /><br />5. Despite massive Government propaganda, which started long before the leave campaign and which both began and ended the &quot;race to the bottom&quot;, the leavers won the referendum. A democratic ballot box vote.<br /><br /><br />6. AFTER the result the courts concluded that despite what we had been repeatedly told, the referendum was advisory.<br /><br /><br />7. In the election which followed, those who did not promise to &quot;honour the outcome of the referendum&quot; did VERY badly. Well over 80% of ALL MP&#39;s were elected on a manifesto promise to &quot;Honour the outcome of the referendum&quot;. Shortly after being elected MANY of them declared themselves &quot;Proud Remainers&quot;and have voted against leaving.<br /><br /><br />8. If you do not represent what you claim to represent at election time,and vote against it; then it is NOT representational democracy. Many MP&#39;s do not represent their constituents, or the UK, or even their own manifesto.<br /><br /><br />9. There was a democratic vote to leave. Remainers like T.May who did everything to please her remainer freinds, refusing to work with real leavers;  35 changes of staff, almost all of them people who could not work towards her &quot;Not really leave at all&quot; option. Also A.C.Grayling who lead delegations BEGGING eurocrats to make brexit as &quot;costly, difficult and damaging as possible&quot;.<br /> These things blocked, sabotaged and undermined a democratic vote to leave.<br /><br /><br />Not that this came as any surprise to me, for the por-EU groups have been anti-democratic in their actions, and contemptuous of anyone who disagrees with them from signing us in onwards. Just look at what happened following the referendum result, self entitled LEADING politicians having childish name calling tantrums which lasted for weeks, calling the electorate &quot;stupid, ignorant, xenophobic and uneducated&quot; Some went further calling them racist and fascist. ( Oh the irony on both of those. )<br /><br /><br />Sorry you were saying something about arrogance? Perhaps you should justify the above before you accuse any leaver of that.
Comment 1046.3	Oh the irony a Remainer calling others &quot;arrogant&quot;. The minority dictating to the majority, talk about arrogant..
Comment 1046.4	Obviously your an uneducated idiot!  The prime minster is the only one who is actually trying to uphold the will of 17.5 million British voters. You, the labour party and the other remainers are the treacherous vermin who are attempting to destroy democracy in this country !
Comment 1046.5	What? The one representing a democratic majority who were taken into the EU without being allowed any vote? Yeh that&#39;s horrible, you should never vote against the EU, and if you do, it wont count anyway, we binned UK democracy for Eurocracy years ago.
Comment1047	It seems to be no matter what country you live in,,,<br />When it comes to the corporate upper-class and our politicians. (Or whatever)<br />Left-wing, Right-wing.<br />Wings of the same Predatorial Warbird. (A Crony capitalist War-police-State PLUTOCRACY!!!) Feeding on the FREE-RANGE SLAVES it creates out of the Poor and Working-class, <br /> sacrificed to their CHRISTIAN-DOLLAR-GOD for Blood oil to grease their War machines.
Comment 1047.1	Then it is about time Free Range Slaves and Poor Working-Class educate themselves. but it is so inconvenient and reading materials are so boring. <br />We rather somebody else do it for us. while we go play our computer games and watch entertainement. <br />Ah sounds like willing slaves doesn´t it .
Comment1048	The Great British remainers need to put on a pair and have some faith in their own country. GREAT BRITAIN IS GREAT FOR A REASON,  We are pioneers and we will be just fine if not better deal or no Deal, Please stop blocking the inevitable, uncertainty is what is damaging our country
Comment 1048.1	Great Britain just got rid of Northern Ireland and Scotland actually wants what NI now has ... and that is out of GB and into the EU.

For the EU&#39;s SAKE and sanity, as you have not been able to properly act  in your OWN interests WHATEVER THEY MAY BE, please approve the agreement, do your legal bit and just get the hell out of the EU!!!!!!
Comment1054	Parliament agreed to let people decide, not to let some people lie to the general public and definitively did not agrre to let the Brexit party hire Cambridge Analytica to steal information from users and then create fake ads in Facebook to convince them to vote to leave...
Comment1055	Awesome
Comment1056	Whinging when you loose is the opposite of democracy.  Remoaners should go live in socialist fake democratic 4th Reich EU after BREXIT.  Fake Britons.
Comment 1056.1	Hahahah don’t tell people you don’t know who is more educated you clearly don’t based on your responses.  No disrespect mate wish you well it isn’t about hate.  Just let democracy work.  The people voted.  The majority wins.  Mob rules wins in their favour.  Vote again in a decade to rejoin.  Calm your tits we can all me friends.
Comment 1056.2	@H Vorthrian It is allright they do raise the common people concern and myth.<br />But a lot of myth comes from people are too lazy to do their own research. <br /><br /><br />They promote the USA as the greatest nation on the world. well it is if you are rich and American who can get a IRS tax deal. <br />Those yeah I can´t fault them.<br />But the average working class American have it bad. those are Americans.<br />Social security system is almost none excistant, unless you are disabled or obsessed. (you wonder why so many american gets obsessed) . <br />Even now in LA they have a 60k yes 60k homeless city in tents. what is the American excuse they must be drugged or alcoholic. <br />I thought the people sleeping in their cars were bad in san francisco cause they couldn´t find a job. do we in europe even have a 10k homeless society someplace ?<br />If we even have a 1K homeless society alarm bells are being pulled to help them.
Comment 1056.3	@Vee Cee Well self preservation is fine but don´t tell others who are more educated then you. that they are wrong.
Comment 1056.4	@Vee Cee EU keep stealing your money from NHS, last time I talked to people working in the NHS the management and britishe<br />people keep stealing all your drugs and medication cause it is free. totally no controlled oversight.<br />I already told that person NHS can´t work that way if it includes every ailment possible to get free drugs. <br />So here those are the facts nothing EU related.
Comment 1056.5	H Vorthrian post empire nah mate self preservation
Comment1057	It’s interesting how the right wingers say the BBC is overtly pro left. The way this was reported was extremely unbalanced and inaccurate actually in favour of the brexiters. This wasn’t a vote to delay or cancel Brexit Laura Kounsberg , it was a vote to finally expel the prospect of a self inflicted no deal.
Comment 1057.1	@AAron Thom I get my information from the Guardian business section actually.   They do a good job of that.   <br /> But of course you are very clever and anyone with a different point of view is a fool, bigot, racist etc etc.  <br /> You have the gall to accuse other people of prejudice whilst immediately assuming that you know what I do and don&#39;t read.  Take a look in the mirror.
Comment 1057.2	glyn hodges Employment figures since 2010 have been a fraud because of the now common nature of 0 hour contracts. Do you need me to list every company that has decided to leave the UK since the vote leaving entire towns with huge unemployment issues??? Watch the news seriously 😒 .Also bear in mind we haven’t even left yet! And we haven’t left on a no deal basis. Obviously people like you get your news from Facebook or the Daily Mail or the Express, it just goes to show how facts don’t matter to half of the population of our country, it’s a travesty.
Comment 1057.3	@AAron Thom Since the Brexit referendum employment has risen to the highest levels seen for thirty or more years.    That is one of those inconvenient truths that lead people to not believe the wilder stories about chaos, doom and destruction being deliberately wrought by Machiavellian characters for personal gain.
Comment 1057.4	glyn hodges am There’s no point in housing being affordable when the lowest earners in society don’t have jobs. The rich elite will further benefit from that... oh wait of course that’s why Nigel Farage and Jacob Reese Mogg and their friends are SO desperate to leave with a no deal.
Comment 1057.5	@AAron Thom Due to the lack of restrictions that borders would bring you will find that factories and production has been moving to eastern europe all the time that we have been members of the EU.  There is cheaper labour there.<br /> House prices dropping from their current 10X the average wage back to something more like the 3 or 4X the average wage would be a great boon.  I am a householder since 2000 and the increase in the price of my house has no benefit for me unless I sell and move to a poor country.  It will cost the next generation a lot to buy it when I die though.
Comment1058	This isn&#39;t about brexit this is about attempting to shoehorn Corbyn in as prime minister, without an election, knowing that mathematically he cannot win an election because labour has lost all seats in Scotland.<br />After that Corbyn and McDonald would throw away even more than Gordon Brown throw away
Comment 1058.1	@TheHuzzlyn If Corbyn [ the man who behaves like he&#39;s a borough counsellor in a meeting of social workers] wants all the benefits of having been PM for a &quot;few days&quot; [said SNP] (massive pension, security services ect), he will have to allow SNP an Independentce Referendum <b>at the same time as deviously preventing   any part of UK leaving EU</b> to get SNP to vote no confidence &amp; back his minority government, &quot;for a few days.&quot; <br />It&#39;s not upto &quot;the government&quot; what EU does with our money, but the SNP way our money would be financing EU to keep Scotland in a fantasy, childlike version of Independence.
Comment 1058.2	Phil Dobson allow Scotland to be their own independent state and have all the benefits they would’ve had if they were part of the uk. The government is just too greedy
Comment 1058.3	@TheHuzzlyn What &quot;won&#39;t happen&quot;?
Comment 1058.4	Phil Dobson that won’t happen, the conservatives are way too greedy. Whenever Ian blackford speaks for the Scottish people, you can hear conservatives heckling him and once saying ‘ you’re out’ , clearly shows how they don’t care about Scotland now and not at all if they were independent.
Comment 1058.5	@TheHuzzlyn But the SNP want independence whilst staying dependent on UK money via EU. But if Corbyn grants SNP a referendum Labour will never again be able to get back Scotish seats for Westminster party.

Comment 1066.1	@peterah7957 When you say shit on think you mean paid for. Spending per head on the four nations in the UK is lowest in England. Bit like when England had to bail out the Republic of Ireland when they tanked their own economy. Remember those dreams of Scotland and Ireland forming the Celtic Tiger, how did that work out..
Comment 1066.2	@peterah7957 I have great respect for Scotland for holding a referendum to leave the Union. It didn&#39;t work out, but at least they tried. Wales, on the other hand though don&#39;t seem to have any views or pride at all. It seems to me that they&#39;re happy to go with whatever England decides.

Comment 1071.4	@R0DSTER lies? Do you mean the ones unproven by remainers in a court of law? Brexiteers were threated with war and bloody famine, absolutely no one from the remain campaigns said anything positive about the EU, nothing, they just threatened us so stfu, you&#39;ve absolutely no idea what you&#39;re talking about

Comment 1073.5	peterah7957 Name Surname Michael Gregory The Laziness and spoiling of the underserving population. The society of the UK gets so much non needed benefits to their life&#39;s which makes them Lazy and gives them a feeling that they are entitled to a numerous amount of things other people have rather then outsmarting, creating and beating the competition they blame all this on equality, the government and countless other things. This is a waste of time, their life and only breeds more of this filth. They need to suffer for this, these idiotic and lazy layabouts need to be punished. It makes me sick to be honest and the Labour Party would only make this worse.<br /><br />The way in which hardworking, successful business&#39;s and individuals are &#39;painted&#39; as the villains. The Labour Party would only make this worse.<br /><br />Their plans to nationalise things is a waste of cash and they have a evil socialist agenda, which should be banned and dismantled as a idea, even worse the Labour Party is anti capitalistic.<br /> <br />The Labour Party and their horrible ideas and ideology should be dismantled and banned.

Comment 1076.1	@That Pizza Delivery Guy If the majority is made up of Tories and Brexit Party, then you can be fairly certain it will be a eurosceptic govt.<br /><br />While that may not lead to what we all want, e.g. clean break, it will at least be a step in the right direction. The rest will follow, eventually.<br /><br />I agree that ripping the plaster off is the best way forward, I would certainly prefer to vote for that. However the forces of evil are not so easily defeated, so by necessity I will play the game. <br /><br />There seems very little chance of a quick win. there will be no win at all if the electorate fall for the Communists plan to &#39;blame the Tories&#39; for the everythings.

Comment1080	Just listen to Corbyn the commie (with his £1.6 million pension fund aka £50,000 per annum) talking about carting about communities.
Comment1081	I&#39;ve seen the extension letter that has been sent to the EU by Boris Johnson, but I have not seen anyone in the DITCH.<br />Can someone tell me why the DITCH is still empty?
Comment 1081.1	@Geffo Me you lost! You undemocratic  pig. People like you are seriously pushing this country towards a violent civil war where the left would be heavily purged 😂😂
Comment 1081.2	@OFTP . Consider how the government will have no legal obligation to honour workers rights in Boris&#39;s Brexit deal. This is something that has clearly been grafted onto Brexit. So how could people really know what they were voting for? A final say referendum would be on the actual Brexit. Perfectly democratic.
Comment 1081.3	@Wendy Follett Thats a fair enough view. Personally I believe May&#39;s deal would restrict growth and ensure further austerity. I am in my 40&#39;s and can semi retire even with austerity but to achieve that outcome you must retrain and work for yourself in a capitalist world. No workers rights will ensure success just more slaves to the system.  I would also suggest you review Labour impacts on the economy historically as they are far worse for people who want to progress. At the end of the day Working rights haven&#39;t been removed and it would only be possible by the UK government which we elect. The Labour party are acknowledging they can&#39;t win a GE and make it UK law that is the main issue here. If the Tories did reduce working rights which hasn&#39;t been proposed they would drop votes which is exactly what they are trying to avoid. Do you believe working rights should be controlled by UK courts or ECJ?
Comment 1081.4	@Andrew Foster it is correct that the deal Boris has secured has moved the promise to secure workers rights from the legally binding text to the political declaration. Even May&#39;s deal was better for the UK. Thanks to austerity I have to keep working for another 7 years and I am very unhappy that now those 7 years can be hell on earth thanks to the tories! I say no to this deal, I would rather have the May deal.
Comment 1081.5	@Andrew Foster. You&#39;re just talking yourself in circles. Sufficient support for leave would win a referendum. End of. And don&#39;t lecture me about democracy. How is it democratic to ask the country to vote for something then tell them later what it means? How was it democratic to use Facebook as a weapon of mass manipulation?
Comment1082	Vote for BREXIT...honour the democratic vote of 17.4 million people. Protesting to remain is undemocratic and goes against what this nation fought for in two world wars. We WILL leave the EU, no matter what.
Comment 1082.1	The right to protest on any side is literally half the definition of democracy...
Comment 1082.2	It literally has nothing to do with what we fought two world wars for.
Comment1083	OMG Bojo I guess your pride must been hurt, you were compelled to ask for a delay.<br />How childish of you to do this childish prank. of a unsigned letter.<br />The PM of UK surely takes his pride before the country. <br />EU will give you the delay cause to spite your childishe actions. <br /><br /><br />I can´t believe people still can´t see the buffoon
Comment 1083.1	@Drake Hound Prisoners serving more than one year are barred by the Representation of the people act - brought in after Bobby Sands was elected in Ireland -  Do you remember that?  I do.<br /> Perhaps Boris would be sentenced to a much longer period in jail.   Like they have done to the Catalonians just last week.  But those 10 year sentences really have not helped Madrid to calm the situation have they?
Comment 1083.2	@Drake Hound You do realise that Spain would block any attempts for Catalonia to become independent and would veto them joining the EU. <br />But if you EUers are so confident, no more referendums, we&#39;ll have a GE and let the British electorate vote on it. This way it&#39;s all legal..
Comment 1083.3	@mhffc Cause the will of the people is fickle. and they want to see if the sentiment is the same. what will you do when it is s not ?<br />Now all the information about how bad BREXIT is for the people have been given.<br />Now people can make a informed decision and 3 choice option Remain, LEAVE with a DEAL or No deal Brexit. as it should in a true democracy. <br />North of the border don´t you worry about it. when they want to leave they would leave. the last time they stayed cause why they would be out of the EU same as Barcelona. now EU is different then 3 year cause a lot of things happened last 3 years. <br />What was once a joke is now reality.
Comment 1083.4	@Drake Hound So if it&#39;s not legally binding why are the Remainers calling for another referendum. Surely they should be calling for a GE, but no they don&#39;t want that for some reason..<br />And what happens if the Scots hold ANOTHER IndyRef and vote to leave the UK. Do we ignore that and say it&#39;s not legally binding..See how that goes down North of the Border..
Comment 1083.5	@mhffc Correct cause it is not legally binding, ask the government to make a LAW that binds it legally. they would say are you NUTS , imagine a referendum about no TAXES ... oh yeah that is reality for you.
Comment1084	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xhny-VF4-Y&amp;t=1m35s"">1:35</a> Did he said <i>&quot;bad for</i> <b>OUR</b> <i>European Union&quot;</i> ?"
Comment 1084.1	@Vee Cee He also said Boris is a liar and a charlatan, don&#39;t miss that bit out, very important point.
Comment 1084.2	IndyX66 they also could make it so we didn’t hear random guy chanting for no brexit.  If he was yelling something like no brexit is treason and not democracy; I guarantee even if it is a  “live” broadcast, you wouldn’t hear it.
Comment1085	Napoleon once famously said, &#39;Every private in the French army carries a field-marshal’s baton in his knapsack.&#39;<br />Fast speed forwards: Every remainer in the Remoaner army carries a spanner his lunch box.
Comment 1085.1	@AWResistance change? Do you have any idea about the damage and repercussions Brexit with no deal would cause? Go read it, there was even an official document leaked from parliament about what could happen and it&#39;s terrifying. Please reconsider
Comment 1085.2	@AWResistance change brexit is for the billionaires ffs
Comment 1085.3	@Feanors Jewel You just fear change.
Comment 1085.4	Yeah, waiting to fix all the shit that &quot;brexiteers&quot; break with our always convenient and handy spanner :) works great on all nuts, metallic and brexphallic
Comment1086	Ask the God for wisdom to solve this ever complicated decision. We have lost the connection and dependence with the God,  that is the main issue
Comment 1086.1	@Drake Hound Choice is good, but when you encourage people to make bad choices, you do irreparable damage to society.
Comment 1086.2	@AWResistance Everybody is evil, but you want real choice don´t you?<br />or you only believe in a black and white world !
Comment 1086.3	@Drake Hound Liberal demon-crats are evil.
Comment 1086.4	Vote Liberal democrats .. get a real 3 choice referenrdum solves all the problems. 3 years get 3 options and then deliver it.
Comment1087	Good old Boris......<br />Fuck remainers....<br />Fuck the EU.....<br />And fuck the BBC.....
Comment1088	Delay, apparently not only in the World of Aviation....
Comment1089	Brexit without exit. <br />That&#39;s the plan.
Comment1090	I can&#39;t wait for my future grandchildren to be voting on whether the country still wants to leave the EU hopefully these fools will be long gone by then!
Comment 1090.1	You&#39;ve just shown your Grandchildren that if they ever dare try to vote for something the government doesn&#39;t want...<br />Then the government along with the people who lost will NEVER honour it.
Comment1091	Donald Tusk: I wonder who sent that because I&#39;m completely stumped!
Comment 1091.1	@hardcore you know the score you didn&#39;t ask any questions
Comment 1091.2	@Stu Morris so you still won&#39;t answer the question then?😂. Well thanks for proving exactly what I&#39;ve said about you to be true. Full of bravado and replying to me no problem, acting the big man and know-it-all. Yet you lose the ability to read when I ask you a simple straightforward question. Then act dumb and claim you don&#39;t even know what question I&#39;m asking. Then when I&#39;ve spelled it out so that a dumbass can understand, you say you don&#39;t read most of what I say. It&#39;s funny though how everything is responded to APART from my question. Very strange. As I&#39;ve already said, I knew this was the way it was going to go. Every single time this works😂. Someone talks shit, I ask them a simple question regarding their comments. They don&#39;t have an answer because it&#39;s not possible to justify bullshit. They come up with a million and one excuses not to answer the question every time I continue to ask it (making themselves look weak, pathetic and stupid). Would be much easier to just answer the question than think of excuses not to answer it, surely? Why wouldn&#39;t you take the opportunity to show me how I&#39;m wrong? Now there&#39;s an interesting question. But no, of course instead you&#39;ve just used all the classic responses to avoid answering. &quot;I didn&#39;t see your question&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re asking&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t read everything&quot;. Heard it so many times. <br />Well, Stu the big man is actually a pussy that hides because he can&#39;t answer a simple question regarding what is going on in his own head. Or should that be, he isn&#39;t man enough to admit he can&#39;t answer it without exposing himself as a  hypocritical shit talker. <br />Glad we cleared that up and made it obvious to everyone that you&#39;re talking so much shit that even you yourself can&#39;t explain it. Carry on hiding then, we can all see what a weak, pathetic man you really are. Or, just answer the question to instantly prove me wrong. But you won&#39;t of course. You can&#39;t😂
Comment 1091.3	@hardcore you know the score listen, I said I didn&#39;t read 3/4 of the shite you&#39;d wrote but there&#39;s no need to get butt hurt about it.  I&#39;ve never been a hypocrite and I&#39;m very light sensitive
Comment 1091.4	@Stu Morris I literally broke it down and explained it two days ago, right after you claimed you didn&#39;t know what I was asking (even though I&#39;d already asked you a few times). You&#39;re conveniently never ever seeing the question when I ask it 😂. Must be blind as well as stupid. Look, I&#39;ve established that you&#39;re a dumb hypocrite, because you can&#39;t explain your hypocrisy to me. Pretending that you go temporarily blind every time I ask you the question is a dumb and desperate tactic to avoid admitting you don&#39;t have an answer. Tbh, every comment you make now makes you look more and more stupid. I&#39;d give up now if I was you, and maybe go buy yourself some glasses
Comment 1091.5	@hardcore you know the score I&#39;ve asked what question several times now, if you can&#39;t be arsed repeating it don&#39;t bother asking why I haven&#39;t answered
Comment1092	Giving to much to Brexit Conservatives dear BBC
Comment1093	Whoops it got lost in the post....Ta-da....NO DEAL....magic.
Comment 1093.1	Post still living in the 1970s.
Comment 1093.2	Oi!!!
Comment 1093.3	They just need to claim they sent it royal mail :)
Comment1094	Revoke Article 50.
Comment 1094.1	What about article 51?
Comment 1094.2	Nah
Comment1095	Must be very embarrassing to ask for extension again 😤🤦‍♂️
Comment 1095.1	@glyn hodges. I smell something Glyn. Are you saying all this just to win a point. Odd how the United Nations gave a damming report of austerity in this country. <br /><br />Odd how many teachers are having to provide food for their pupils. So no BS please.
Comment 1095.2	@Geffo Me I am a full time carer for a disabled adult.  Most people would call us poor but we do not need to use food banks. Claims of nurses (starting salary £24,000) needing foodbanks to survive are pure lies.<br /> Charities have always existed and food banks are just the latest incarnation.  Some are good and some are abused by people who make a career out of it (nothing new if you read Oliver Twist).  You know that if you pay (£500 if I remember) you can get a starter pack to set up your very own food bank?  <br /> As for the exchange rate of the pound it has no immediate impact on me since holidays abroad don&#39;t happen.  There was an article by Owen Jones some time ago bemoaning the high value of the pound and its negative impact on British business and exports.   It is not a simple indicator of wealth or wellbeing.
Comment 1095.3	@glyn hodges. I said that there weren&#39;t any food banks back then. At least none I was aware of. And collection baskets were not in every supermarket. The need for both has exploded over the past ten years though. Go figure.<br />As for education I remember my brother working at a run down special needs school. And I saw with my own eyes how funds were made available and clear improvements made. I can&#39;t see how anyone could possibly argue that the Conservatives are somehow better. At least not for the average person. And don&#39;t mention the economy. Look at the pound.
Comment 1095.4	@Geffo Me There weren&#39;t any food banks = There weren&#39;&#39;t any poor people.<br />  Good grief.<br /> And Blairs expansion of higher education to 50% of the population was just stupid.  I have worked in many places and none at all needed 50% of people to have degrees. <br /> In the Phillippines a local told me their McDonalds was better than ours.  I asked why so and she replied &#39;Because you need a degree to work in McDonalds here&#39;.<br /> That is what he has done.  Debt for what is far too often a useless degree.  <br /> Meanwhile the chemistry department I studied at closed down and the local tech college closed its practical vocational training in favour of soft subjects that needed no workshops or physical resources.   Crammed more students in though.<br /> And with 50% having degrees we still have to import trained labour from the third world.   Ridiculous.
Comment1096	bojos wigs been blew off his fat head
Comment1097	No more delays! Brexit now.
Comment1098	I remember when I was in 5th grade I did something like this .... LoL... 😂🤣.... Send letters without signing 😄😃😂🤣☺️
Comment 1098.1	Didn&#39;t know someone bound your hand by law undenmineing your ability to deliver a substantial deal for millions of voter in the 5th grade.
Comment 1098.2	Do you remember when you had votes in school and then the teachers would just ignore the outcome?? Nope me neither, because my teachers weren&#39;t shitty selfish remainers
Comment 1098.3	Someone forced you to send letters in the 5th grade?
Comment 1098.4	Thats exactly what he did
Comment1099	Thumbs up if you want to Leave, thumbs down if you want to Remain.
Comment 1099.1	And you&#39;ll probably get more done than this government haha
Comment1100	People tend to forget, at the moment, we are under EU law. That laws overrides UK law. May new that herself.
Comment 1100.1	This is not the EU&#39;s fault for Britain&#39;s government delaying the brexit deal
Comment1101	revoke article 50 and then take 10-20 years to negotiate new deals and agreements required to make Brexit a success first and then think about leaving.
Comment 1101.1	Like the EU will be around in 20 years, it&#39;s imploding now..
Comment 1101.2	Now, that&#39;s actually more realistic.
Comment1102	Go Boris!
Comment1103	lets remove the prime minister, parliament, and all other branches of government and restore the absolute power of her majesty the queen
Comment 1103.1	But, fascism began under a monarchy. The Kingdom of Italy 1922, Mussolini and King Victor Emmanuel III. Is that what you want for Britain?
Comment 1103.2	Her majesty the Queen doesn&#39;t even run her own bath, how is she going to run a country?<br />And when she croaks, I suppose you want Prince Charlie to continue the running of the country., 😵
Comment 1103.3	Fuck the Queen and fuck parliament. Independence for every country in the UK.
Comment 1103.4	I cannot speak for her Majesty the Queen. but my assumption and it just is a assumption, would be Why on Earth would I want to run a country with so much responsibility, when I am now without burden and blaim still TAX supported and free.
Comment1104	Yipee! The gammons will be triggered!
Comment 1104.1	@The Bad Brit <br />You&#39;re still a racist....
Comment 1104.2	@Jim Goodwin I thought Gammons likes political incorrectness?
Comment 1104.3	@The Bad Brit I was referring to your description of foreign aid recipients.<br />You&#39;re a racist, and not a very bright one either......
Comment 1104.4	@Jim Goodwin Gammon isn&#39;t a racist slur, Gammon.
Comment 1104.5	The Bad Brit <br />And a racist - nice.....
Comment1105	This is the most undemocratic decision I&#39;ve ever seen in my lifetime. The majority voted to leave, deal or no deal. It&#39;s ironic that the land of the Magna Carta now refuses to accept the will of the people
Comment 1105.1	stop Mass Hysteria I don’t speak for anyone I’m just saying it’s not as black and white as you make it out to be.
Comment 1105.2	@JayJay5244 do you speak for the many who voted to leave, no, just like me, you don&#39;t. Your an undemocratic self righteous virtue signalling hypocrite that can&#39;t and won&#39;t respect the result of the biggest referendum we&#39;ve ever had
Comment 1105.3	magna carta was never aimed at the will of the people but the will of the commoners basically those undemocratic snobs in the house of commons that all have a fat bank account and free stately home, they are kept very sweet.<br /><br /><br />the magna carta all started over the rich been taxed too much by the king on the land they rented to peasants at an exstortionate price also.
Comment 1105.4	That’s not true. Many who voted to leave voted to leave with a deal because they were told so by politicians. <br /><br />No-deal Brexit is a fairly new idea that popped up as recently as last year and certainly didn’t exist during the campaign.
Comment1106	I wonder if the EU is scratching their collective head at who on earth could this mysterious request have come from?
Comment 1106.1	@MR Spoon LOL John Sweeney used to work for the BBC!!!!<br />If only you knew what a fool you sound like to people in Britain.
Comment 1106.2	@Greeny202a Blinkers off dude , blinkers off! Everything on that vid is factual and happened !
Comment 1106.3	@MR Spoon If you believe the propaganda from John Sweeney then you are more stupid than I first thought.

Comment 1106.5	@MR Spoon You are delusional. The EU will collapse shortly after Britain leaves. France and Germany cannot keep the EU going without UK money.
Comment1107	Ridiculous that a law exists forcing him to make a letter
Comment 1107.1	Jake S if the government cant make their own decisions we need a election as a government “governs” no?
Comment 1107.2	Jake S the Ben act
Comment 1107.3	Jake S it is law check out article 50
Comment 1107.4	If parliament makes a decision, it is a law.  It isn&#39;t a &quot;law&quot; that Boris sens the letter, just that parliament said he has to.
Comment1108	yeah well the show must go on.
Comment 1108.1	@Delltawn Northri <br />It really is. It&#39;s a very clever bit of propaganda because it uses mostly facts, it lies through lies of omissions creating a false context for the facts it uses. If you use it as a single source it weaves a very convincing tale; but if you look at original sources you start finding the omitted facts which reveal it as &#39;Conspiracy theory claptrap&#39;.
Comment 1108.2	@The Other It really isn&#39;t. You are just too indoctrinated; or a shill. There is no way one can watch or listen to those things I linked or referenced , and then do fact checks, and come up with &quot;Conspiracy theory calptrap&quot;.<br /><br /><br />I will just continue to stand strong in my commitment to waking up my people to their dire and correctable(if something is done) situation, and leave the incorrigible automaton NPC&#39;s like you to do your thing...
Comment 1108.3	@Delltawn Northri <br />Conspiracy theory claptrap.
