Comment1	this isnt about simple taxes but this is about how the government is stealing the peoples money and how they have no jobs to sustain them any longer and this has been going on for 20+ years. its time for a new government that isnt divided in sects. lebanon is united as one.

Comment19	Sad! Lebanon is unique in zona! I for instance ador Laban! I am sudden 2 see this!!! I had lived in Lebanon in the district of Junih( though I used 2 called it, Junice) in 1995! There always were guns/fighter...e.t.c. &amp; plenty of cabaret places! They seemed to me as a nation @ trouble, picking up on foreign blood; and that within their domestic issues . Very sad! Very sad!
Comment20	For crying out loud, do you really think people would riot in the streets for 6 days demanding economic reform? It&#39;s a matter of life or death for them, especially since they know there will be serious repercussions for leaving the streets. I really wish the foreign media would stop spinning it as a demand for action on the government&#39;s part when in fact people are demanding a complete change in government.

Comment47	"The majority of Lebanese people want a true political change were state and religion are separate but alone they stand no chance against the Civil War Lords that have been , terrorizing and stealing the country for over 45 years and passing the power from father to son.<br /><br />Before Lebanon slips into another civil war and without conflict of interest UN permanent state members should act fast and call for an urgent meeting to try to mediate the situation and help Lebanon move to a true democratic state.<br />First, all accounts and all assets of all Civil War Lords, past and present politicians should be seized to be returned to the future democratically elected Lebanese government.<br />Secondly bring to justice all those responsible for Lebanon civil war crimes against humanity under UN chapter VII; comparatively to population percentages more people were killed in Lebanon civil war than in Vietnam civil war.<br />Thirdly after ethnic census organize a true democratic parliamentary election with representation based on ethnic population percentage and with no Civil War Lord or any of the past or present parliament members allowed to run and the entire Lebanon as one district and the president elected by the people and not by members of parliament.<br />Finally, under no circumstances should the international community lend any money to Lebanon before there is a true political change because the money will be stolen by the Civil War Lords that create hate and division to stay in power and the poor will have to pay it back through taxes.<br /> <br />Rafik Hariri came to power he declared his wealth to be $4 billions when he died his kids inherited in cash $18 billions, plus properties and companies inside and outside Lebanon, only one property that is Biel size 1’000m by 2’000m that’s 2 million square meters at a price of $20’000 per square meter is worth $40 billions; where all this money came from, where are his tax filings?<br />Lebanon&#39;s debt is estimated $75 billions and one family stole more than Lebanon debts.<br />Then you have Nabih Biri only God knows how much, same for the others Walid Jumblatt, Amine Gmayel, Samir, Geagea, Fouad Siniora, Riad Salamé without his support a lot of the money would not have been stolen, the banking sector that were barely taxed and loaned the government politician&#39;s theft money at as high as 40% interest rate.<br />On the other hand you have the majority of the population that lives way under the poverty line, they barely earn enough money to live; the minimum wage is $450 per month, poor flat rental ranges from $100 to $300, the minimum transport is $50 per month, then what’s left is barely enough to pay for little food, little water, little electricity if available, little clothing, no medical care if you are not registered by your employer and even the government does not register some of their employees.<br /><br />If those who are in power are allowed to stay, they will sell whatever profitable assets Lebanon still have to themselves, manage to steal the money and Lebanon will become a failed state."
Comment 47.1	And the Lebenese like myself will tell you, that you are deluded in your belief to think that a civil war is gonna happen anytime soon. <br />It takes alot to push the Lebanese free spirit, and this is just the beginning of a budding flower.
Comment48	And the BBC have barely even covered this. They claim to bring the news thats important to you. <br />So their editors think covering stories based around climate change and extinction rebellion is more important than any  protests against real corruption, such as whats been the case in Lebanon.
Comment49	For all other countries,<br />Here is how you make a protest:<br /><br />1st. go to the street planning to stay at least for 3 days. (you keep protesting till what you want happens).<br /><br />2nd. Go to the street with a smile on your face because you have to be patient for alot of time, so try to be happy as much as you can.<br /><br />3rd. Bring a dj or someone who has speakers and a microphone to put songs and write your own rhymes.<br />Pro tip: use bad language so the whole world listen to you insulting the dickheads. (we sang &#39;hela hela hela hela hoo Gebran Bassil kes emo) it is directed to his mother 😁😁😁<br /><br />4th. Clean your garbage from the streets for your self respect 👍<br /><br />5th. Don&#39;t forget that... If you fool me once shame on you, if you fool me twice shame on me. Don&#39;t change the major goal and don&#39;t believe anyone, only act on past experience.<br /><br />Good luck 👍

Comment52	Politicians have stole our dreams, future, our kids future. They are nothing but a bunch of thieves liars and killers. They are criminals and they should be prosecuted ASAP. No exemptions. We are done done done. Go to prison. The laws applied to you too.
Comment53	I am completely convinced that most peoples lives are not much different than they were 20 or 50 years ago. What&#39;s different is the public&#39;s expectations are higher now. They expect less corruption, more equitable distribution of resources and a more accountable and rapidly responsive government. They aren&#39;t getting it so the public gets mad and flows into the streets, or elects people like Viktor Orban or Amlo as it grasps at straws hoping they will change things for the better. They won&#39;t of course but this is the learning curve for the public and their leaders I suppose. It takes a while for institutional memory to sink in.
Comment54	Fuck off BBC with your title, pure lies. Hariri didn&#39;t accept any reforms! He offered utter bullshit solutions, did not address corruption or anti-corruption laws, did not state anything about the 320 billion stolen and said he won&#39;t move an inch from his throne as Hezbollah got his back. FAKE NEWS!!
Comment55	Maybe Iran’s people will do the same get someone in office that they want
Comment 55.1	Well they have a group that do ,but the Iran government tired to plant a bomb on foreign soil and get rid of them. You can read about it in the state department website.

Comment 57.1	THATS D CLAIM OF THE RIGHT ,IN TRUTH LEFT EASES RESTRICTIONS AND TAXES BY MULTIPLE REASONS DUE TO THE CORE OF SOCIALIST IDEALOGY <br />NO GOOD COMES OUT OF RIGHTWINGERS
Comment 57.2	@Kerman Koonekerman yes u are right taxes are not the core of capitalism but law taxes are tge trends while the left trends is higher taxes and more social insurance like health and free college......<br />I see reason in both but u cant say people protesting to taxes are anticapitalist
Comment 57.3	Imposing tax or not is not a core, defining , matter of capitalism <br />, Yes the Hariri state has been in line with UK policies <br />it is the UK messing up Lebanon

Comment96	This system needs to forget religion, and the 20 thieves passing power need to go and pay back what they stole, Lebanese diversity is something to celebrate not divide , one president elected two terms even if Athiest the rest Lebanese people and partys are formed on ideas, not religion, god doesn&#39;t pay bills end of the month , the elite  have no religion, no ethics, no conscious,  Lebanese people excel abroad when given opportunity just this rotten elite are glued to power using religion to divide and concuer,, they want to fix things in 72 hours lo Einstien rose from the dead lol l well you had 30 plus years just resign and don&#39;t threaten that it gets worse if left vacant, appreciate your concern, they are used to wait 9 months for governments to form, and years for budgets to pass, taxing what&#39;s app who the producer offer for free says it all they would tax oxygen if they can lol Love u Lebanon remove those bad apples
Comment 96.1	@Zepher Gaming for sure also in the rest of the advanced world who fought bloody wars the sustenance is from the same source, and it  doesn&#39;t ask if the president is christian, prime minnister sunni and Parlement Shia , whoever the Lebanese people feel respect this sustenance and make sure the powerful doesn&#39;t take whats not his, should lead and the rest hold him accountable, using a rotten system developed after ocupation and invasion and civil war  to divide the people instead of celebrate their diversity, and evaluate their skill is not acceptable in this age, hope Lebanon produces more oil than KSA but if those are left in power no way they will handle it right, I am speaking out of love as a Jordanian our heart is broken to see this level of corruption, Lebanon exported  Art &amp; music and Litreature the lebanse know how to build electrical plants but let the thiefs and who ever is benefiting from the generators let them fix it, , I am in america and workede with many lebanse, hard working and smart they turn half opprotunities to bussines  , just give me them an opprotunity,  we loved everything about lebanon, its heart breaking to see a land from heaven and capable lovely people waste energy on reforming a clinically dead system, who ever is religious its between him and god and his actions speak louder, The blue print is infront of us we are not inventing the wheel. Doesnt get an easier we are allowed to cheat just not from SISI lol :)
Comment 96.2	“God doesn’t pay bills at the end of the month”<br />Bro all of our sustenance comes from God.
Comment97	I love how in a futurist society a lot of countries are revolting around subjects like internet messaging apps
Comment 97.1	@The Hole in Dans Sock yea I know you were supporting the people but s/he misunderstood you  sorry for that. I&#39;m just making it clear that it&#39;s not just an instant messaging problem
Comment 97.2	@Roro Imaso tech shall set the world free....<br />Boko Haram can&#39;t hide 300 girls in 20 years from now with drones at high levels
Comment 97.3	I was supporting the &quot;people&quot; in my message if you read it. And some guy told me to fuck off and 6 people upvoted it? Wow. Fags.
Comment 97.4	There was a big fire 2 days prior to the whatsapp taxation that burned a lot of cities and citizens homes in lebanon and if it wasn&#39;t for the help of some neighbor countries we could have been screwed.And 2 weeks prior to that our currency went down. Add to that the system failure and electricity &amp; water(polluted water) constant cut offs(we pay for generators and we buy water since 30 years) and basic human needs that are very expensive.
Comment98	A chaos world!
Comment99	Good
Comment100	No communism please it does not work!!
Comment 100.1	Fuck off you peace of shit, this has nothing to do with that, we Lebanese don’t hate rich people and we love Capitalism, what we are fighting against is a government that has been stealing our money by taking share of our taxes, that has caused the Lebanese economy to be fucked on all levels and which have lead to our standards of living continuously falling. We are also fighting to reform our government which has split our country based on race and religious lines and we want that change, we want our whole government structure to change.
