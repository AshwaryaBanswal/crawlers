Comment27	It might have worked better if sung in Aramaic.
Comment28	baby shark tut tut tut....
Comment29	WHEREA THE CAR SEAT!?
Comment30	That&#39;s the way to do it! So much negativity going on in this world. Amidst something so important to the Lebanese people and chaos that can become of a protest, they stop to ease a scared child. As a father myself, I find it unbelievably awesome! Much respect to all of them 😊
Comment31	This is so kind of them. Wonderful people!<br />Praying the best outcome for Lebanon🌹
Comment32	My friend took a change of flight in HK airport with her 2 year old during the protest in there, she refused to take one of the flyers the young protesters tried to give her, and protesters pointed lasers onto her baby...... You only deserves human rights when you act human... Good job Lebanese protesters.
Comment33	Trevor Noah sent me here.
Comment34	That baby’s lookin at the parent like “wooooowww, word? .....y’all set this up or sum? Was this supposed to be cute?” I thought it was 😂❤️
Comment35	While in HK, &quot;protestors&quot; won&#39;t let foreign passengers go home for their babies
Comment36	Never go wrong with baby shark song lol. People need to change themselves first then things will be better. Saddam gone but 1000 saddans are there now, mubarak gone now a coup dictatorship, qaddafe gonne the country is in ruins. But again no word to any baby shark singers lol
Comment37	Happy to be Lebanese 😇
Comment38	Sounds like the students in school.

Comment52	To all 60 dislikers I say: hela hela hela hooo
Comment 52.1	Accurate 😂 😂 😂
Comment53	Lebanese people are weird and crazy
Comment54	Beauitful men thank God let&#39;s love our children
Comment55	They scared the child even more by doing that. Barbaric, tactless fools.<br />They could&#39;ve just opened up for them and let them drive through instead holding them up even more and being loud.
Comment 55.1	Barbaric tactless fools? You must be a retarded Trump supporter......
Comment 55.2	no they didn&#39;t. The child is wondering =  Mom, What am i supposed to do now ? Shall i join the song ? Shut up ? These scary monsters<br />don&#39;t look scary anymore, i know that song,  Mom !!!!!!!! Say something !!!!! give me a sign. 😂 😂<br />And you should be more outraged about the fact that a small child&#39;s seat belt is unfastened, he&#39;s on the front seat of a car, and he&#39;s not siting in the correct <br />child car seat appropriate for his tiny body 3 felonies in 1 😂 😂
Comment 55.3	stfu
Comment 55.4	Numerous protesters saying that after the clip ended, the baby laughed.
Comment 55.5	Lol, a afraid Lebanese child, if you go to kindergarten in Lebanon, you will be afraid of them and start running away. 😂 😂
Comment56	Baby be like : <br /><br /><br />&quot;What these big children are doing ?!?&quot; 😂
Comment 56.1	Filippo Tommaso Marinetti 🤣🤣🙃🙃
Comment57	Kahlil Gibran would be so proud of these Lebanese protesters.

Comment58	uh?? funny!!!
Comment59	Love Lebanon from Iraq 🇮🇶🔥
Comment60	This is so sweet🥺😭
Comment61	Save Lebanon !❤<br /><br />Our politicians (and the president of the Lebanese Banks) stoled from us about $800,000,000,000 !!!!!!!!!!! (NOT EXAGGERATING AT ALL)<br /><br />We want a new goverment and we want to retrieve all this money so that we can pay Lebanon&#39;s debts and fulfil the people needs and rights actually (clean water, 24/24 electricity, good streets and roads, ...)<br /><br />Huge thanks for everyone that shares and tries to save our country ❤
Comment62	Masha’Allah 😂❤️
Comment63	these guys are my heros

Comment67	That was really nice n cool of those guys...and the kid was like &quot; u guys for real?&quot;😅 but the mom shouldn&#39;t let the kid sit in the front...its not safe
Comment68	Pray for Lebanon at least there is an inner child alive on each of us
Comment69	Lebanese people are really some of the sweetest kindest and humble people out there. So proud♥️♥️
Comment70	Viva la revolucion..... ! Jebran bassil ya louty, Kis imak maniouke
Comment71	Wowwww......I am impressed by these protesters.
Comment 71.1	Skip the first couple off minutes
Comment72	If hong kong protestor could be like these protestor, instead of throwing petrol bomb at their train station and scaring the local resident with their violence
Comment73	this is a great moment..respect Lebanon👏👏👏
Comment74	The child will grow up to watch this video knowing that these people were fighting for his future. :)<br /><br />I don&#39;t think any video shows off how the Lebanese protest really is better than this video, a lot of people, standing together, fighting for one goal, while laughing and having fun with each others. :P
Comment75	This is very cute but am I the only mother like &quot;Why is that child in the passenger seat instead of in the back seat in a car seat?&quot;.
Comment 75.1	@Giles Flower yeah, figured it was probably not a rule/law...still concerning
Comment 75.2	Different countries, different rules. Child seats are lifesavers for sure, but not every country mandates them.
Comment76	Someone teach them the proper hand signals please.
Comment77	قسم بالله فله
Comment78	Why is the baby not in a car seat???
Comment 78.1	Be cause he mother dancer in the protests😂
Comment79	This was just a small bit of in site on How all of Humanity dont have to see eye to eye, but can still find the common ground that we all hold.
Comment80	No baby car seat!!
Comment81	We are the people around the world 🇱🇧 God bless my country Lebanon
Comment82	I would be scared to driving around at night with an open window and no car seat
Comment83	In Lebanon now there is around 2 million people protesting, it is a revolution, not just some few protesters, we need the world support and awareness, it is a critical situation
Comment 83.1	@eli M thanks so much for your response i wish i could visit there
Comment 83.2	@Esteban Moeller the political establishment is too corrupt, beyond anyone&#39;s imaginations, so it is against corruption, taxes and not getting anything from this corrupt government and previous ones for the last 30 years. And since the problem is that each political party hides behind the religion it represents to do it&#39;s crimes, the protests are against religious sectarianism also. It is a very complicated country if one wants to go into details, but the main thing is corruption to put it simply.
Comment 83.3	protesting about what?  sincerely want to know
Comment84	Wow heroes fighting for a cause, u have earned my respect.
Comment85	😃😂
Comment86	Yehi agar india mein hota<br />Toh Indian protestar<br /><br /><b>gaadi Fodd saale ki</b>   😂
Comment87	Am I the only person who realizes this is a horrible mother? Why isn&#39;t that little child in a car seat in the back?
Comment 87.1	.... they aint driving they are just sitting in the car with the protestors
Comment 87.2	@Hannah HOK, first the word is spelled &quot;you&#39;re&quot; not &quot;your&quot;. You forgot the apostrophe in &quot;don&#39;t&quot; and you also spelled &quot;labor&quot; wrong. Hmmm, three mistakes in such a short response! Also, this woman&#39;s biological ability to conceive a child and then give birth to it, in no way justifies her bad parenting skills or ignorant reasons why she has such a small child sitting in the front seat of a car, without even a seatbelt on, while driving! As a matter of fact, you only prove my point by making such LOSER comments. If this &quot;hero&quot; of a woman went through SOOO much to give birth to this child, then why doesn&#39;t she show any respect for its safety or life? If you really want to try to have an intelligent argument with me then I suggest you bring some food....because I will EAT YOUR LUNCH! Have a nice day.
Comment 87.3	Don&#39;t worry.. it isn&#39;t America.. not many irresponsible drivers in Lebanon
Comment 87.4	Your a negative loser ... get a life!!!<br />You dont know what situation caused her to not do that... absloutely disgusting of you to judge a woman who carried this baby and then went throught LABOUR without knowing anything! ! !
Comment88	&quot;Stop it, you&#39;re scaring the baby&quot; &quot;Okay we&#39;ll sing him a song about man eating sharks to calm him down&quot;.
Comment89	Omg 🤣😂
Comment90	So touching
Comment91	bbc how much time was spent teaching them this song?
Comment 91.1	"<a href=""https://youtu.be/xwZnNmSuDw4"">https://youtu.be/xwZnNmSuDw4</a> maybe if you watch this video you will know how much time it took to teach them"
Comment 91.2	Just wake up dude

Comment115	❤️💚 Support people in Beirut! I am from Hong kong and it seems that we both are in hard times. Insist and one day the dawn will come!
Comment 115.1	Please know that many Americans love and support both Lebanon and Hong Kong, even if we screwed up and elected a corrupt dictator as president. He doesn&#39;t represent our love and care and feelings for you both.
Comment 115.2	@Bring Me Z Horizon thanks!
Comment 115.3	Eyy good luck in your protests man! Hope you all achieve your goals :)
Comment 115.4	And here is so much love to Hong Kong from lebanon🇱🇧
Comment116	That child was scared stiff, a lot of you folks below are talking pure rubbish.
Comment 116.1	Tracymmo that child was scared stiff, any one who has had kids will tell you the same, no smile on face at all, facial expression does not change as the child looks from those clowns to who ever is in the car with the child.<br /> they made it worse by sticking their stupid big heads in the car, invading the child&#39;s personal space, bullocks to anyone that cannot see that !
Comment 116.2	He was baffled. If he was scared, he would have reached for Mom. I have no trouble believing the comments that he laughed after the clip ended. Sometimes little ones need a sec to take something in.
Comment117	IDF would have shot them both.
Comment118	انشهرنا😂😂🇱🇧❤
Comment 118.1	اي والله😂😂😂
Comment 118.2	😄
Comment119	The people looking for a better life stopped their effort just to make a little guy feel better. That made my day. We need more of the type of humanity those people showed and we need leaders throughout the world to behave w the same character and kindness. Thank you dear Lebanese; you have set an example that the rest of us must follow. I hope peace and prosperity returns to Lebanon, that its people have a happy future and that the higher being smiles on those who showed such kindness.

Comment133	It’s good that he didn’t scared lolz 😂😂😂
Comment134	For ppl complaining about the seat belt. And my lebanese brothers who lie and say lebanon does not have it. Just say the truth? The government are not doing a good job which is part of the reason why ppl are less educated about such things. So add that as a &quot;note&quot; to the protest and why they should do it.
Comment135	👑
Comment136	That&#39;s what a man do.. respect woman and children. Have a courage and be kind
Comment 136.1	Now that&#39;s what I call real men ! Kind! strong ! Loving! Yet will not be stompd on by no one BRAVO 👏👏👏👏👏 I wish we handed men like this and handsome too!!! .....and American men do not try and say oh we had men like this yes we did that where always a lot lot older then me that&#39;s why I had to date older men ! But now I am in my later 40&#39;s and thay are dead.  Men like this are a tale to be told and boys of this gens moms have made sure of that with there bad parenting and girls from this generation are the worst omg you even look at them at thay scream rape fuck them ! How do I no well I no how women are thay never liked me ! And I don&#39;t like them ! I have a son he&#39;s a grate young man husband, and very good daddy so I no me and my ex did a good jod !

Comment137	ahahaha that&#39;s awesome! it put a smile on my face. &lt;3
Comment138	Don&#39;t worry guys Hong Kong will respond with gangnum style
Comment 138.1	I like the comment above that they&#39;ll do the Sound of Music
Comment 138.2	Gangam style is Korean though
Comment139	Little do the protestors and the toddler’s mom know, he is secretly an ardent supporter of the government’s policies. That’s why he looked so confused.
Comment 139.1	You&#39;ve got me rolling on the floor, pissing my pants, and crying in laughter..... Thanks for that!!!!!!
Comment 139.2	🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comment140	Cars come with powered windows for a reason. Someone pls convey this message to the mother.
Comment 140.1	Also she was the one recording, it&#39;s not like she didnt wanna be there, she enjoyed it and had a laugh lol
Comment 140.2	why should she close the window ?<br />we are all people if were protesting against the goverment dowsnt make us killers . anw u should search more about that protest before teaching the mom what to do &lt;3 &lt;3 no offense
Comment141	no car seat for kid?
Comment 141.1	@Joseph Haddad You don&#39;t need to justify anything.
Comment 141.2	Hello People, take it easy. ok maybe the law is not strict like in other countries, but I can assure you Robin does have his car seat and it is right behind him and it is as such simply because we are educated people, we do what is right, we are responsible and we care about our families. I don&#39;t know why his mother put him next to her WITH A SEATBELT, maybe because he might end up scared and start crying all alone in the back and she wanted to focus on driving considering what was going on around her. I could assure you it is a first, she would never put him next to her (always secured in his car seat). you might ask how do I know that?Well his mother happens to be my wife and I&#39;m his Father... thank you for you concern!!!!
Comment 141.3	argle bargle I’m Lebanese and i live in Lebanon too and I’ve never seen a parent carry their kid in their lap. Yes the government doesn’t have enough laws and enforcements and not all parents are aware of the importance of a car seat but it’s simple logic not to drive with your child in your lap.
Comment 141.4	@Jana Najd This video, in its essence, is asking for changing Lebanon for the better. Hopefully if people get out of their sectarian shit, lebanon has the potential to be an amazing country. But the way it&#39;s been for the last few decades, you know as well as I do, people here get away with stuff you could never get away with in other countries., including the car seat thing.
Comment 141.5	@Jana Najd maybe I dont live in the area you do or maybe you&#39;re trying to make your country seem law abiding and civilized, but I live in leabnon and I do have my facts straight. There are a few people who have learned from the outside world that a car seat is a necessity for babies but most here carry their baby in their lap. It&#39;s only recently that the government has enforced the use of seatbelts.
Comment142	That is the cutest thing I&#39;ve seen all day, and exactly the way we need to see people around the world portrayed, in a fair and balanced way. Protester shark, do do do do do do!
Comment143	undoubtedly, Lebanese are the happiest depressed people in the world.
Comment 143.1	probably haven&#39;t met an argentinian
Comment 143.2	@Nitish Saxena yeah i know i mean most arabs are Muslims so i just generalised them, i know that sounded wrong lol
Comment 143.3	@yacineKCL there are a lot of Christian Lebanese people too
Comment 143.4	that&#39;s muslims for you lol XD inb4 someone calling me a terrorist :)
Comment 143.5	@Mansour Bellah El-Hajj love it!
Comment144	상어 노래의 승리다
Comment145	The Lebanese are extremely kind and caring !! I loved seeing this and explaining it to my own daughter here in canada
Comment 145.1	No matter the religion being a caring open minded person is what truly matters if we want this world to change for the better.
Comment 145.2	@phoenician lebanese that&#39;s bull shit. We are palestinians and arabs and i have never in my life heard a single person say a bad word about lebanon. In fact my family roots is from a crusader colony in palestine. And for some reason my  family is named after a lebanese city. And yet people have always smiled happily when they heard my family name thinking i am from lebanon. <br />So i am wondering and  i really mean to ask you this. Where did you get the impression that arabs are always talking shit about lebanon?
Comment 145.3	@LordPatrick123456 so the argument is that lebanon is a proud example of how arabs and muslims can solve things in a civilized or/and in a peaceful wat. well, this is what debaters do. it is not my &quot;field&quot; and i get what you are saying. Yet the problem with debaters is that they keep using useless information to step away from what matters.<br />So telling me &quot;lebanon has so many different groups&quot;  is gonna be more than enough for someone to read your answer and take it as &quot; uh so that&#39;s why it is not so bad, because it has ppl other than arabs and muslims&quot;. <br />And the world does not  need that nonsense. It is the age of debaters where we even got someome debating if water is human rights.......seriously can we just drop that crap and say. Lebanon is an arabic country, that&#39;s half the point and it is a fact nothing to prove there.m. Muslims are more than half the population. That&#39;s enough to prove the rest. We are not talking about &quot;how lebanon have diversity in it&quot; it is the point that half those chill peaceful ppl are muslims and i hope the world can see how they ain&#39;t evil.
Comment 145.4	@ryan Forgo No I&#39;m saying that if you dissociate religion from the portrayal of a certain demographic population, maybe you got a shot at proving your point.<br />I have spent a lot of time debating people with extreme views, and they are definitely race/religiously driven. Take away both of these elements, they&#39;ll either be forced to agree with you, or show their true intentions.
Comment146	They are having a good time during this protest, love it! ❤️
Comment147	That was pretty amazing
Comment148	Sharks are scary animals to children.

Comment 184.2	"nor sud  old Lebanese singer melhem barakat saying we have no culture or folklore, everything came from beautiful Palestine 🇵🇸 ❤️😘 <a href=""https://youtu.be/K-LWiOT_c1Q"">https://youtu.be/K-LWiOT_c1Q</a><br />A witness from your own kind"
Comment 184.3	nor sud nor sud  typical answer from an inferior uneducated beast .. you make Lebanese look like what the Media paints you guys sectarian gangsters and uneducated hypocrites🤮🤢.<br /><br />Palestine 🇵🇸 ❤️❤️❤️❤️😘
Comment 184.4	@Golden Crown we had culture and we proud and had country u stay without country u sold it 🤣🤣🤣 and ur culture is dirty refugies
Comment 184.5	nor sud nor sud  first of all you either write in English or Arabic you seem like a zealous with no culture,you want to prove your point do it in a way where people can at least take your fake opinion seriously. Other then that Cannanites covered all the way from Babylon to the Sinai desert. The phenocians are the same as the Cannanites . Lebanon is a new entity created by the French that belongs to Syria and some to Palestine..Jordan as well is a fake country created by the British as an buffer zone to protect the new Zionist entity whom compose of Eastern European Bolshevik Jewish squatters. The Hashemites are not from the Levant they were given autonomy as an reward for their allegiance to the British colonialists. The same with Lebanon an small entity comprised of poor villagers of nomadic mountain dwellers the French gave them autonomy for their allegiance to the French colonialist, specifically the Maronites whom are mostly Assyrian Catholic Christian whom ran away from the Turks in Antioch seeking refuge in a mountain in Syria called Mount Lebanon and that’s how Lebanon got its name. The phenocians, Cannanites hitties, philstines, all ancient near Eastern civilizations are extinct although a small confound number of their decedents can be found amongst the “fellahin” of Palestine meaning the farmers whom actually own the land and have culture and traditional clothes whom can be both Christian fallahi Palestinian and Muslim fellahi Palestinian. However the city people of Palestine have a less chance of being descendent of those civilizations and also the Lebanese and Syrian city people even have a lesser chance because of the hundreds of empires that invaded the Levant always targeted the easier people who were willing to leave and did not own lands rather lived in small like apartments.<br />Everything else you hear about the phenocians on media is false it’s used for political reasons to divide the near East, divide and conquer is a western imperialist game and the fools like you fall for it. I’ve done my research and read a lot about it, it would be nice if we in the East would resort to civilized discourse rather then cussing and denying on weak basis which is what you’re doing :)
Comment185	Baby: &quot;you seeing this shit?&quot;

Comment 193.3	So our dictators in the middleeast are not the best 😲I thought we won the dictatorships world cop , I will admit  , N Korea &amp; China are top 10 but we ours are handmade   , we just Introduced MR Bone Saw He chopped a human in a consulate, and politely took the parts in 5 suit cases ,were they melted the body in the ambassador house , he wanted to win The Green Dictator award or Dictators for Green energy but he didn&#39;t anticipate the world wouldn&#39;t like it 😂😂just kidding guys laughter and dark jokes helps some times

Thats it, there is no war, just people demanding their rights!!
