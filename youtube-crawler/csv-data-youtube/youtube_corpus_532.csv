Comment10	Sky News are cowards and are stopping free speech .... they are the only channel to “disable” their comments section on this News story and also on their “Devon nursery abuse” vid along with the death of scum rat “baghadi” .. they don’t like people commenting the truth or comments against their own views .. lying joke of a channel ..
Comment11	BBC will you be doing a News video on the sacking of the lying bitter racist John Sweeney from his position at the BBC ????????
Comment12	Why is no one talking about the end of democracy in uk then? The people voted leave and won vote and for last few years its been deliberately delayed again and again and npw they call for a revote as either their reports say they will now win it or they are going to fix it to get result they want. None of you can say in uk that you have democracy. Those cheering if they bow get a remain outcome will over time reap the results of this failure of democracy when one day they wake to find slowly their votes mean nothing to.
Comment13	I love hearing stories of rape and rape trial sabotage but there&#39;s no place for this in our parliament. Wales should break free from the UK along with Ireland and Scotland

Comment17	Britain needs absolutely new faces in politics otherwise the country will not survive in the state it is now, so pitty
Comment18	every single day more and more lies come out of tories mouthes.  “I&#39;m not upset that you lied to me, I&#39;m upset that from now on I can&#39;t believe you.” This is the only reason why they could not make a deal with EU.
Comment19	Has Jo Swinson invented any more statistics lately? 😂
