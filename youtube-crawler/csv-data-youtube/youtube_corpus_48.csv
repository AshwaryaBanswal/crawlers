Comment1	Dear  Brits...read the transcript before you go on the air with your socialist screed and vitriolic reporting.  HM requires it of you!
Comment2	Wait until President Trump invokes the tu Quoque defense in the Senate and begins calling witnesses to prove Democrats did the same things he is accused of doing.
Comment3	No US President has EVER been removed, even the ones who committed a crime. And this one won&#39;t either. Move along and don&#39;t renew your licence...
Comment4	Where‚Äôs your proof.  Fake news!
Comment5	and why is this wrong exactly? bidens are a bunch of corrupt psychopats and biden&#39;s son is a criminal who stole millions from ukraine, he should be investigated.
Comment6	Biden is a crook. He robbed Ukraine and scammed the country.   I go there every year. Most of the land that belonged to people belong to Biden now. Somehow Biden is the victim because Trump wants to know the truth?
Comment7	It‚Äôs is amazing when you have republicans turning on the president because of his treason, then of course Frump turns on them because that is what he does, then his followers still believe him and his lies. He literally could kill a man in cold blood and these fools would stick with him. Only Fox news tells the truth when all the rest tell lies(keep believing that Frump lovers).
Comment8	Impeach Trump, let democrats finish destroying America
Comment9	Dear Tony Jerker, idiot at large, any chance of some journalism or possibly even truth? Lovely story about a pumpkin fair btw. Nothing about Hillary slandering Tulsi Gabbard, or the NYT covering it up by editing Russia to Republican though. Tulsi goes up in the polls, thanks to the lying unhinged hag Clinton. ROFL
Comment10	The left should know that a president cannot be impeached simply because they hate him.
Comment 10.1	I agree. But, not even for CUROPTION, not even in riching himself with taxes payer&#39;s money. And it&#39;s Sad. They didn&#39;t let him have the G-7 in his resort in Florida...imagen POOR guy the money he missed out on. Go Trump keep doing what ur doing üëç
Comment11	The left should know that a president cannot be impeached simply because they hate him.
Comment 11.1	It&#39;s a good thing that they&#39;re not going to impeach him because they hate him but because Mulvaney ADMITTED to a quid pro quo without even realising it.
Comment12	Yeah trumps a bad guy...... Says hillary the baby eating pea_do üòÇ
Comment13	What about epst_ein though and the royals and politicians? They all linked and causing these wars<br /> If you consider that ep_ stein is blatantly liked to the Prince, who is blatantly linked to Jim sa _ville then this all started to come out before brexit and you could say that this entire brexit joke show has been to cover up the fact our country is run by a group of pea_dos. <br />Distract the masses with a circus to drown out all other noise.<br /> Same with Russia and hillary clinton, the Russia thing only poped up after clinton and podesta and the pizza Gate thing. People mostly too dumb to notice the timings unfortunately
Comment14	Why does the MSM now always use Vietnam war as some kind of badge of honour.<br />Only yesterday, it was like some big cold war booboo..
Comment15	Democrats are Fuck and Obama too
Comment16	Resist IdenTity politics tyranny
Comment17	Trump has already raised 720 million dollars for his campaign. It‚Äôs a massive machine with over 200 consultants. Get ready Dems... you are going to get beat down more than in 2016. Lololol.
Comment18	I like the way he did this. Lol. It was entertaining but yet informative at the same time.....kind of like what trump does. Hes always had a knack for entertaining people while hes on TV. Oh Donald Dump you. Stick to your little tv series and let the big boys run this country.
Comment19	What the BBC failed to report was the Republicans that stormed the impeachment inquiry had meet with trump the afternoon night before the inquiry, and it was planned. They are now attacking the process. What they don&#39;t understand also is there is a mini war going on being the Trump governmental officials and the career federal officials of the federal Officials, which Trump guaranteed when he shut down the government over funding his wall.
Comment20	Oh dear god the lies just carry on. The BBC thankfully ate rapping there own necks with a noose. Hopefully when boris wins the next election we can get rid of this socialist, communist propaganda.
