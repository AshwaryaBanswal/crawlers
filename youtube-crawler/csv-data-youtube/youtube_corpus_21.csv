Comment16	Mnhd Bts<br />I hate and criticised the iranian regime directly because of spending 15billions on iraq and Syria each year and ignoring it&#39;s own people.but to be honest Iraqi people they must kiss hand if iranians because if they were not the first people to stay and fight ISIS now every state of iraq were suffer to horror and they were beheading people every day.history shows arabs are not loyal and thankful.i hate iranian regime for those reasons.iran should take back his money  and leave them and let them they deal with ISIS themself.
Comment 16.1	Guess what we could have done it without help of IRAN  but what you can do when we have corrupt government that are influenced by  Iranians? Their army are right now killing the protester in Iraq.. Soleimani is helping Iraq government to kill Iraq protester.. He is kiling the same people that fought Isis in war.
Comment17	Youre all ungratefull i live in Iran everybody has hate to iran i swear every Nation will fall who threatens iran
Comment 17.1	No we don&#39;t hate Iran, please don&#39;t think that, it&#39;s the political pressure and looting of the oil revenues that we will not tolerate any longer! We simply want to claim back the rights of our country, to form and rule it in favour of the Iraqi nation! Not foreign powers.
Comment 17.2	@Tom Noy No... we are only isolated...
Comment 17.3	Iran is the most disgusting country on the planet, violent and dumb beyond repair.
Comment18	Look how hard they brutally blind and kidnap ppl in France, UK or US when there was YELLOWVEST protests everyday for 1 year in France for ex....But they COULDN&#39;T possibly allow that to be in the &quot;news&quot;.  Without constant blame on Iran, Westerners killing Jesus&#39; people in Palestine and rest of west Asia since Alexander started it 2300 years ago, would start to get noticed.....of the Nuclear boms and Terrors that they blame on their victims &amp; any culture they wish to steal from or sabotage / ruin as cultural competition that must be set back to the stone age and &quot;crippled&quot; or starved / sanctioned to death, before being robbed  by Western imperialistic profiteers, -or having their leaders chosen for them from london or washington, so the Westerners never have to do any real &amp; beneficial work in life be good at all to be millionaires while they can&#39;t even prepare basic meals or live honest lives on small budgets w/o stealing from &amp; terizing the whole World &amp; various nations at a time....Ppl who cant even work, live honest lives on regular or small budgets, willing to use their armies, Nukes, &amp; terror strategies to cause chaos and misery all around the World...while constantly blaming all they do in broad daylight on others as a genius &amp; effective distraction technique!
Comment19	These were not the protesters, the same people who attacked the Iranian consulate are the same groups that attacked the protesters are the same group that attacked the popular mobilization forces base and killed 2 brothers that also serve as commanders.<br />Let&#39;s not forget that Saddam support era were not wiped out, a large group of them are still alive and they are armed with heavy weapons and been spreading terrorism across Iraqi soil.
Comment20	lol , general ghasemi shouldve let isis destroy them and we shouldve kept our soldiers on our own borders , why do we save these people every time ? they are bad people they are the people who killed the imams , iran should leave theyr country in 10months they will start killing each other again
Comment 20.1	Well atleast your cowardly 12th Iman is still hiding in cave ðŸ˜‚
