Comment1	&quot;The Good Stuff&quot; in Missouri could have another definition. It would depend on whether you lived down in the Bootheel or in Wine Country. I&#39;ll just stop there.
Comment2	"I have to go out before I watch this whole video, so I thought I&#39;d mention to you that  The 6.6 that just hit the island of Mindanao, is just 20 miles from Mount Apo, a large solfataric, potentially-active stratovolcano. But I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll talk about it. It&#39;s not deep or swarming....yet."
