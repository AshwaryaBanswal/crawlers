Comment21	These are the sanctions Trump put on turkey for buying s400 missile systems.<br />What a slap down.
Comment22	Backing off now that Russia is in the game. The West is a joke. Get the hell out of the middle east already. Your war against &quot;Terrorism&quot; has caused nothing but chaos! Every country the US has been to is a total mess. Criminals with access to lethal weapons are in charge, just because you wanted to &quot;police&quot; the world. Everyone who thinks that a country, 1000s of miles away from their home, wants to achieve something great at their destination is a fool. For years, they were talking about &quot;Terrorism, dictators and human rights&quot;. Everything was bullshit so far. It was all about deception.

Comment29	He confess why Americans are in Syria; OIL only.  Americans don&#39;t care about Kurds (look like care of them these days, but if they don&#39;t allow US to suck oil in Syria, you will see Kurds will turn to worst enemy of US), don&#39;t care about Democracy, don&#39;t care about human life, civil genocides, etc... Socialist ateist Kurds did genocide to Muslim Kurds, Arabs, Kaldanies, Turkmenians in Syria just to allow US to suck the petrol there against thousands of trucks of American weapons. This is the confessed truth by American President... 😡😡😡
Comment30	Honest headline:  <b>Weak, Apathetic Criminal Betrays America&#39;s Allies, and Empowers America&#39;s Adversaries – </b><b><i>AGAIN</i></b><b> – Yet He&#39;s Still President</b><br />As long as he remains in office, his treason will just keep escalating.  He&#39;s made America <i>complicit in the </i><b><i>ethnic cleansing</i></b><i> of allies,</i> while surrendering the Middle East to Putin.
Comment31	One drop of blood is more valuable than a one drop of oil or?...
Comment32	We secure our border, now we can build oil pumps in Turkey. By the way, we weren’t fighting with PKK/PYD/SDF for century. We were fighting 20-30 years or so. Our natural enemy is Greeks always been Greek. Byzantium empire and East Roman empire they all Greek. Let us Focus on Greeks after terrorists.
Comment 32.1	Александр Кононов we have no problems with Russians and no interest in their lands. But I believe you are wrong. Because Russian orthodox church very different then greeks at least their ideology is different. I been at Russia Novorolsky they are nice people. They’re just don’t care safety at work 😂
Comment 32.2	@Muhammed NAMDAR we have different stories. The Byzantine Empire tried to rule the Russian lands, they made our alphabet, introduced Orthodoxy. Russia is connected with the Greeks, but wants to be friends as well with Turkey. It&#39;s all very complicated.
Comment 32.3	Александр Кононов why we fought in ancient times in Anatolia , ww1 invasion of izmir and in Cyprus 1974. we are going to fight again I sure of it. Even If Turkey 🇹🇷 don’t want to fight with Greece 🇬🇷, greeks still want İstanbul and make it Constantinople. There is anti islamic protests in Greece. There is no peace for Turkey near future. They don’t leave us alone so war it is. I just telling the facts and predicting the future. I don’t against greeks they can keep live happily in their lands. But I still don’t like them. 😑
Comment 32.4	Have you lost your mind. The Greeks are not enemies
Comment33	When were the sanctions applied?
Comment34	How many people killed since 9/11 some how all weapons used by terrorist belong to USA 🇺🇸, They don’t care about the people. Petrol $$$ free money free oil

Comment 35.1	DO YOU KNOW HOW STUPID YOU SOUND ?
Comment36	Trump is not a tough man. This guy is a fraud. Putin looked into his eyes and saw a pussy. He&#39;s belly is the color of his hair. YELLOW.

Comment45	This guy is destroying our reputation around the world, he’s a loose cannon and he cheapens the presidency with his uncouth and unprofessional language.  He doesn’t think ahead and he unilaterally changes our foreign policy after one phone call.  His level of arrogance is unbelievable, he makes us look like arrogant, ignorant and selfish people who only care about ourselves.
Comment46	When are the Clinton&#39;s going to be in jail?
Comment47	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8I5Oq3EfRU&amp;t=11m48s"">11:48</a> very true!"
Comment48	Ok, this is the story: Trump to Ardoghan: USA military will leave the common border of Syria and turkey ,so you can do what you want on Kurds,at the end when you are done I will emerge like a save angle and tell you stop turkey and you stop because you reach your goal but I need that show off
Comment49	so how much did donald get paid to allow turkey to kill kurds?
Comment50	Not the job of America to risk its soldiers indefinitely. Great President. Trump 2020

Comment57	For American their mission accomplished they destroyed Syria and syrian fabric of integration, all for that Syria can never protest the Israel&#39;s annaxtion of Golan Height.
Comment58	BBC IS NOT WILLING TO HAVE THE COMMENTS SECTION DEMOCRATICALLY AVAILABLE TO THE VIEWERS  , <br />BBC IS USED TO PUT WORDS IN TO MOUTH OF PEOPLE ,NOT HEAR FROM
Comment59	Mr Trump you need to read his Bible to see what God say&#39;s about this  The Gog and the Magog  - I know 100% the sanctions will be going back on later ... The big war is coming soon so is Jesus...
Comment60	Trump lifts sanctions off Turkey.<br /><br />I wonder if he will lift sanctions off chicken too.
Comment61	trump is the 3rd best president in our history, love you trump!
Comment62	Americans need to understand that Russia runs the show now. This is not going to be forever, but if you react aggressively at this time, you&#39;ll get the hammer.
Comment63	He definitely didn&#39;t get thanks by the general and nobody caught the ISIS escapees.  What a load of shite.
Comment64	Is she too stupid to understand what&#39;s going on or just lying through his teeth?  Always tough to tell with a lying idiot.  And 43% of Americans are dumb enough to believe whatever he says.  That&#39;s almost more worrying.
Comment65	It might not be the assault on the senses you think it is.  Feels like you could get sun burn looking at him.  Wonder which choir he&#39;s singing to?
Comment66	So basically you fucked up and now trying to convince people you are not?😇😂
Comment67	Treasonous Trump is the worst POTUS ever ever ever and ever
Comment 67.1	DO YOU KNOW HOW STUPID YOU SOUND ?
Comment68	Latest news: Trump wins 2020 election easily and media are up in arms again.  They immediately make up ten new fake stories about him.

Comment 74.1	@MrEd Who the FUCK told you I was American? I just said your president is a F moron... Nothing else!
Comment 74.2	@eblgraphics So you want American troops to go back to Syria despite the ceasefire? You going to sign up and volunteer?
Comment 74.3	@MrEd Yep is official his followers are morons too. No, he started a new war and Turkey took a dump on him. He literally gave ISIS a second life and in the process betrayed those who help America making new enemies in the process. Peace lol he just gave Russia and Iran the upper hand for the next 20 years. You guys are so simple minded is beyond me.
Comment 74.4	He just pulled Troops out of Syria and leaned on Turkey to keep the peace. Why don&#39;t you like peace? What&#39;s wrong with you?
Comment75	BBC the feminist Inquisition channel
Comment76	Congrats, Mr. President, for removing our troops from Syria. Now how about getting us the hell out of Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Iraq, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, as well as Germany, Japan, Poland, etc., etc., etc. We need a new Monroe Doctrine. America will limit its use of the military to the western hemisphere, where chaos reigns in Venezuela, Chile, Mexico, and most of Central America.
Comment77	As for no American blood being spilled...? Don&#39;t join up if you can&#39;t take a joke.<br />More people are killed in USAmerica by the smog from the oil than US soldiers doing the job they signed up to and are contracted to do for the militarised state.<br />And a militarised state that wont allow their ASSETS to be spent isn&#39;t seen to be having balls and the world knows it.<br />Trump beat America. America lost again.
Comment78	Vogon poetry.
Comment79	The most efficient response to ISIS has come from the Kurds who are best suited to root out sleeper cells because their militias are locals. The invasion from Turkey was a cinical land grab that Trumpamerica effectively sanctioned.
Comment80	Bloodsstain sand but u love the oil from the bloodstain sand mofo!!!!

Comment114	Best US president ever because if you look at all the other presidents in the recent past, Trump has caused the least amount of destruction to the Islamic world and his hands are the least stained of the blood of the Muslims. He did not start any war in the Islamic world rather he is ending the wars. But at the end of the day he&#39;s an American and just as his predecessors he was after the resources of other countries like oil in the Middle East which he got. What differentiates him from the other presidents is he doesn’t use fake and flowery speech of bringing democracy to the people of the Middle East. America is there for oil and oil alone, democracy and human rights are just excuses for justification.
Comment115	How many human experiments will happens in the middle East next?.. How many times those country they gonna use comical weapon on children and a woman? For human experiments how much did you pay to turkey? I believe Russia pay too. To Turkey . Is not only you...
Comment116	U.s.a sold! Does it make america great again? Delusional. U kick out all ur allies, u sold ur country to russia and let them winnin and make it a world leader, u dethroned your own country. Before we look up to america but now we are looking down on you. What had happen? Is it true democracy is dead?
Comment117	Why Pres. Trump did not praise Russia, they are also part of the Turkish coalition against his ex-allies.
Comment 117.1	Trump is actually a good man, he doesn&#39;t know the dirty game of politics, he rightly ceased support for FSA in 2017 but forced to support them again.
Comment118	He is talking complete and utter nonsense ..
Comment 118.1	He pulls  his troops out, then leans on Turkey to keep the peace. Why are you pro-war?

Comment 123.1	@Talk Blocked Calming down is tough for you. Learn to practice mindfulness. I LOVE how just in the last 24 hours Trump successfully ordered the strike against ISIS&#39; #1 leader Abu Bakr al Bagdadi. You look real dumb. Again Trump helps America and saves the world.  We all rest a little safer tonight &lt;3 Thank you PRESIDENT TRUMP :D
Comment 123.2	@The Yung Jerks Remember the part where I said, <b>&quot;Human beings?&quot;</b>  I wasn&#39;t holding my breath and waiting for a demented parrot to <i>understand</i> anything I said.  I was just debunking bunk.  I&#39;d explain that parroting more bunk hasn&#39;t helped, but parrots don&#39;t <i>understand;</i> you just <i>repeat.</i>
Comment 123.3	@Talk Blocked Remember the part where I said &quot;calm down princess&quot;? Give it a try :) America is going to be A OK and the economy is humming brilliantly. Black unemployment and overall unemployment are at all time lows thanks to Trump&#39;s policies. You just need to calm down princess. We will make it through the night &lt;3
Comment 123.4	@The Yung Jerks No human being is monstrous enough to believe that&#39;s sufficient, or stupid enough to believe that&#39;s true.  America can never repair what +rump has broken; +rump is the most effective weapon Putin has ever wielded.  Who will ever again make the deadly mistake of trusting America?

Comment152	Sounds like his cocaine problem is getting worse.
Comment153	Trump hotels in Turkey but not in Syria. Hmmm...
Comment154	Sanctions against Turkey must remain in place until theTurks entirely pull back to the original border separating Syria from Turkey.<br />  Wow and big deal, no American blood has been spilt. Great, but blood is blood so what about Kurdish blood? Are Kurdish lives, their blood, of no value? What a selfish, self-serving simpleton this man Trump is.
Comment 154.1	not Kurdish blood, terrorist blood has been spilt. An organisation that has been killing people since forever.

Comment162	Woov that making statements about the amerikan political advisor clowns needs some guts. Bravo Mr.Trump.
Comment163	&quot;We have secured the oil...&quot; All is well! 🍻
Comment 163.1	@Concrete Lightbulb  Venezuela ranks first in terms of oil reserves. Saudi Arabia first place in oil production
Comment 163.2	@Tina Morris Oil is harder to sell than to produce.
Comment 163.3	@Tina Morris citation please I don&#39;t remember that
Comment 163.4	@Gamer Cat 36 i remember them calling obama weak from pulling out the middle east.
Comment164	Turkey has committed war crimes. Many civilians have died in northern Syria. and it has also laid the groundwork for jailed ISIL jihadist terrorists to escape from prison. Your approach to law and justice is not good enough.
Comment165	I really hope he gets impeached soon, holy hell. Trump is dangerously stupid.
Comment166	Well at least he admitted it was our fault and we were only in it for the oil
Comment 166.1	@Breezy Mods the same people who he allowed to grow back and reorganize by him pulling out of syria and causing a war against the kurds.
Comment 166.2	He also said alittle think about decimating isis you know the people that cut peoples heads off, rape children, blow up schools etc.
Comment 166.3	No Prob-llama comment returned a little bit of hope in humanity
Comment167	AND WHY CAN&#39;T HE BE COLORLESS ( PALE, NO COLOR ) LIKE THE COLD CAVES AND LACK OF SUNLIGHT? NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER THINK OF THE DAY THAT I COULD SAY? WHITE PEOPLE ARE WEAK? THEY JUST HAVE THE GUNS. CAUSE WITHOUT THEM (GUNS) THAT&#39;S A RAP.

Comment171	🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉
Comment172	What was it a 8 days? And what sanctions actually were in affect? He made a Loud point it was just His decision [not something that he was directed to do] . To know why Trump does what he does , read his book The Art of the Deal. It is his Play Book. I have to force myself to to listen to him , but we do what we must do to know what is happening.

Comment 176.2	What does he mean when he says no one can beat us remember September 11th
Comment177	Why aren&#39;t the comments available on the other stories in the news?
Comment178	Donald seems a bit out of breath.
Comment 178.1	danjpoche - His desk has a drawer full of amphetamines. Not so hilarious, given he’s unstable, impulsive, an idiot, and has the nuclear codes
Comment 178.2	He has a serious cocaine problem, and by &quot;serious&quot; I mean hilarious.
Comment179	you what ????
Comment180	syrians cant protect their own oil fields....dont remember them asking the un to send the us to help them protect anything ....ever
Comment 180.1	BLAKBODHISATTVA <br />if you’re not interested - fair enough even though I have no idea why you’d bother keeping up with the news<br />if you just want people trying to give context to anything to shut up - well let’s abolish freedom of speech all together. agree to disagree or do you want to remain angry?
Comment 180.2	@RebelDog Nobody asked you for an explanation and history of mid east and the US, or  geo politics...did they? gtfoh...Stop offering your analysis when no one asks you or needs it...
Comment 180.3	BLAKBODHISATTVA alright then. rot in your ignorance and have a nice day

Comment 180.5	BLAKBODHISATTVA go look up what I’m talking about and perhaps you’ll understand the issue. understanding is key at the moment
Comment181	The more I watch these collaborants, more I respect the Kurdish people who died and suffered only to be betrayed.
Comment 181.1	Eloquently Emma while I partly agree, at the end of the day Britain did betray Czechoslovakia. I’m just drawing a line between the two
Comment 181.2	What most people don’t realise is that Neville Chamberlain needed the time of the appeasement in order for Britain to prepare for war. Without the time Britain would have been truly lost. Unfortunately people just view him as a suck-up and a coward when what he did was sacrifice his own personal reputation to gain us time.
Comment 181.3	9nniosalier1 Trump is the new Neville Chamberlain. appeaser and ends with western betrayal

A fine example of just how Democracy is not supposed to work!! This is how the Dictator wannabe wants it!!  Next...his base!! If you are a Republican and don&#39;t agree with him, you are human scum!!... Yes, this is how the President of the United States talks!! Disgusting!!
Comment189	Thank you Putin!
Comment190	You dumb-fuck libtards...Trump&#39;s probably had the EU hassling him on the phone: &quot;please don&#39;t piss-off Turkey, Trump, we need them economically strong, and we need them to keep the migrant hoards at bay&quot;
Comment191	🤣🤣😂😂
Comment192	Ignorant person here 🙋🏼‍♂️! Did he say we don’t know about oil!? If he did! I honestly don’t know what the fuck is going on!!!!
Comment193	Thank you Putin for talking to Erodogan.<br />Now offcourse I will take credit for it. cause I don´t have anything else to take credit for.<br />Putin wants the sanctions gone, so I follow Putins orders.

Comment197	...and neo-cons and neo-libs be like: &quot;aww, but we wanted Turkey to continue to be aggressive so US forces had to remain in the region...Quick, somebody arrange another false-flag, but make it CONVINCING this time...People saw right through that <i>air-dropped bomb bursting through a roof, yet came to rest on a bed</i> thing, and the <i>gas attack wasn&#39;t actually a dust storm but gas attack</i> thing!&quot;
Comment198	One of the worst public speakers I have ever seen
Comment 198.1	Josh Guillen seriously he is actually one of the best speakers I have ever seen.  Straight to the point without all the political waffle
Comment 198.2	Linguists say that he speaks at a 5th grade (10 year old’s) level. I’d say that’s a bit generous. Trump is fond of saying that he “has the best words” — unfortunately, those words are all “me, me, me, me, me, me, ME.” I miss the days when we had intelligent, articulate, <b>sane</b> presidents.
Comment 198.3	One of the worst human beings ever.
Comment199	As an American, I&#39;m speechless
Comment 199.1	@Khadr Trudeau I still stand by what I said. You can put labels all you want but until a candidate runs on a communist platform, I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m wrong. Bernie Sanders has described himself as a socialist but doesnt run as a socialist party. Hes an independent and a progressive, his platform and ideas prove that much. Hes far from what a communist would want in all honesty, hes too much on reforming capitalism.<br />AOC is a democrat and her platform puts her as pretty progressive as well. If you read her platform, which is readily available online, she is more about civil and economic rights that, again, want to reform capitalism.  A far cry from communists. <br /> No communist has been in a seat of power in contemporary times. <br />Second, Iraq and Vietnam have similarities but are not the same conflict. The fight in Iraq is multiple more nuanced than Vietnam.  We are trying to prop up a nation while under the treat of people we cant overtly attack. In Vietnam, you had a conflict that didnt finish what they started, which was a political action that needed political conclusion.  Iraq, we are still in the process and this time we wont mess up. Finish what we started, nothing more, nothing less. That doesnt meant backing down from intl agreements either. Sadly, it&#39;s up the US career diplomats and state service members who know what American values are. Our president doesnt understand the importance of professionalism in our civil service. There are ways of making things happen, he just doesnt understand how to utilize the government properly and hes paying the price now. Democrats are only doing what they have to, to check another branch of government when they overstep their own.
Comment 199.2	@Christian Nipales Bernie ran as a Socialist and elected. AOC is a communist, but ran under the Dimorat label. same same. <br /><br />Vietnam and Iraq are the same thing. Start the war, then  stab the troops in the back to gain political power. Trump has learned this lesson, he lived and watch the replay. He will withdraw are troops. &quot;Truman Obama&quot;  Truman stuck with the thankless job of nation building after we won the war. Read the Dimorat media they hated him, still do. Obama just walked away and let the monsters take over. Dimorats are vampires they need blood, rivers of it. 3 1/2 years of Trump and the hunger is burning. So you have given up on your first statement that there were no communist in the Congress.
Comment 199.3	@Khadr Trudeau You can out labels all you want but until someone gets elected into an actual seat under a communist party platform, then I&#39;ll agree with you. Second, you go all over the place, Truman- obama, then john Kerry. Please reply with something that&#39;s understandable. American wont ever stand down in the face of terror, Bush said it best, dont negotiate.
Comment 199.4	@Christian Nipales Their has been plenty of communist in the US Congress. 1st chairman of HUAC D. NY Dickstein communist spy. Bernie Sanders, Obama. FDR&#39;s Vice President Wallace.. The list is endless. All Dimorats. Lost a won War. The Iraq war was over 6 months before Obama took office, he kept banging on about it. The Anbar Awaking worked. Purple Finger! They had a government and the economy was growing. Kind of like Japan or West Germany in 1948. But Dimorats hate Truman. He was no Messiah, The One. After Vietnam American should have learned the truth. The evil is within, murder millions for political gain. Pol Pot, Boat People, Killing Fields and D. John Kerry laughing about &quot;No more than 1500 dead, Tops&quot; Obama did fundamental change the USA, the Republicans have gone back to their roots. Isolationist. Good luck with your Pocahontas. FIRST Female, American Indian a twofer.
Comment200	A lot of lying and sniffing going on during that speech. And no mentioning of his boss Vladi.
Comment 200.1	LMFAO Prove it stupid!! LMFAO So many so dam dumb!! You belong in a zoo

Comment 200.3	Sheldon Adelson is his boss. Don&#39;t blame the Russian government and it&#39;s people.
Comment 200.4	Typos. Sorry. Al Nusra and Isis are allies. Obama and the Saudis were was arming Al Nusra in Syria for regime change. Assad dropped the petrodollar.
Comment 200.5	Right. Who escalted the war im Syria by arming Al Nusra rebels lnked to Isis who the kurds were fighting. Obama funnelled weapons to Saudis who gave them to Al Nusra. For regime change. You do know Iran is a major ally of Russia. Did Putin tell Trump to drop the nuclear deal with Iran and impose sanctions which are crippliing the country. Do you understand that Russia Iran and China are all trying to stop trading oil in the petrodollar. The US dollar is pinned to oil and is the global reserve trading currency. Iraq Libya Syria all tried to drop the petrodollar. Venezuela did do. Do you understand it made lead to a greater war. If the petrodollar goes the US has nothing else to lose as the banking system will implode. Learn some truth about the world other than what the corporate media is telling you. And I mean all the MSM. And no. I&#39;m from Belfast not Moscow. Grow up.
Comment201	&quot;American foreign policy not guided by ideology...&quot; Proceeds to describe an ideology... 🙄<br /><br />What a rambling nonsensical speech. The man has zero charisma, zero presence. When is he going to realise he was only ever popular as the star of a reality TV freak show?
Comment 201.1	DO YOU KNOW HOW STUPID YOU SOUND ?
Comment 201.2	How does it FEEL to be wrong? I can prove you&#39;re a moron
Comment202	What’s he really saying in this tho... 🤔
Comment 202.1	He doesn’t know, and he’ll say the opposite tomorrow, anyway. Really no point in putting too much stock in his incoherent word-salad.
Comment 202.2	SOUNDBOY-1 You&#39;d really have to ask him...but...I don&#39;t think he knows either!!
Comment 202.3	There’s a hand gesture that he uses, too, under the table
Comment203	its a bout money for himself and oil for many rich people,look at all the war that have being going on for the last 50 years all of them are oil contry
Comment204	Stupid! !! What a mentally ill person
Comment205	Syria abandoned and Turkey helped. Dictatorships winning over democracy.
Comment 205.1	@Khadr Trudeau Same here in UK, black folks think we whites who were not even alive when there was slavery all owe them something with there superior awful attitude.
Comment 205.2	@Fonzie At least your not in the States were they claim they were brought in chains in the 1600&#39;s. Preparations 40 acres and a mule, with interest. Screaming racism.
Comment 205.3	@Khadr Trudeau It is why they come to the UK, they get preferential treatment over white British..
Comment 205.4	Turkey is not a dictatorship. Muslim&#39;s can&#39;t handle democracy.
Comment 205.5	@Breezy Mods Ah OK you have good philosophy, respect ! You left out wine and song but maybe you learn that pleasure too ;)
Comment206	How is PUTIN going to feed millions of Syrians when they arrive home, and its PUTIN RESPONSIBILITY to  guard the 10,000 captured ISIS fighters lets see if PUTIN releases these terrorists???
Comment207	Doing a great job president trump . For the people. KAG 2020 keep America great
Comment208	I bet you Erdogan told him to say that, <br /><br />He gets played for the idiot that he is, that explains his flip flops and friendship with dictators and extreme Zionists.
Comment209	👍👍👍he has the capacity to stop the killings. Handed the problems over to Russia.
Comment 209.1	He caused the killings you dumbass.  Had he not pulled out of Syria there&#39;d be no war.
Comment210	An evil imbecile oligarch looking out for his wannabe dictator buddies.
Comment211	I think he just described the Ottoman Empire as a ‘tribal conflict’.
Comment 211.1	@RebelDog :)))) being consistently  ignorant is a defect. But far from being an idiot. I think as a dealer and rich born individual he has managed to develop a different set of skills. Which helped him in his whole life. That&#39;s why he never needed a more sophisticated, humane and logic approach. Because it always worked for him. But that doesn&#39;t help him in connecting  with others and gaining admiration. I think that&#39;s the actual case. Your president is an ignorant and arrogant business and show man. he will lead your country in his way of thinking during his presidency. Somehow I have the gut feeling he is the necessary evil (or troll).
Comment 211.2	He’s an idiot.
Comment 211.3	Alt Metin ah yes! scientists have found out that against popular belief he does possess a brain! studies being conducted now if that brain is fit leading the superpower that is the US :p
Comment 211.4	:)) yes he did. But he is a smart man . He will learn it fast.
Comment212	&gt;causes the fight in the first place by withdraeing the troops<br />&gt;creates a cease fire for the fighting <br /><br />stonks ^
Comment 212.1	Comic Book Guy that is literally what being allies means. Trump backstabbed their former ally because the oil the US is so desperate for is secure. does that make it any better?
Comment 212.2	@viper king 65 US + Kurds = a mutually parasitic relationship, each party incidentally aiding the other ONLY because it benefits themselves.
Comment 212.3	@Comic Book Guy But they were our allies and kicked ISIS out :(
Comment 212.4	okay then, USA polices the region for eternity, great!
Comment213	BS
Comment214	All that happened was that Russia stepped in to replace the US. Geez
Comment 214.1	LMFAO Your A stupid low info scumbag
Comment 214.2	Breezy Mods <br />And you think that because ? <br />Remember Assange had already informed us years ago (before Snowden - although he had the details)  that our credit cards and Iphones were spying/tracking devices.
Comment 214.3	Bob Loblaw allies help eachother.
Comment 214.4	tigressnsnow snowden is almost as dumb as joe rogan
Comment215	Funny that some of the same people that complain that the USA meddles too much in others&#39; affairs and is too militaristic, also ridicule attempts to end conflicts and leave.
Comment 215.1	Keith Roy the US interferes because they have oil to gain. the US leaves when the oil is secure. never mind the slaughter Erdogan is planning against the Kurds who fought and took out IS, alongside US soldiers
Comment216	Yes thank you  trump for abandoning us to Turkey
Comment 216.1	@Bryan Ouellet You just reelected a fool. Go hide in shame. Canada is a disgrace.
Comment 216.2	@Chiriac Puiu &quot; US proved that they are not to be trusted as allies&quot;  You write this on a British channel. The god forsaken reason was the PKK was killing Turks in Turkey and hiding behind the USA. Who told you America would drive Turkey, Iraq and Iran off their land and establish a Kurdistan? Be thankful your women weren&#39;t sold on the Raqqa Sex Slave market.
Comment 216.3	@Khadr Trudeau have you considered becoming literate, before proposing to criticize others, and presume to define people you don&#39;t know, through prejudice?
Comment 216.4	@Khadr Trudeau lolololol lolololol lolololol lolololol lolololol lolololol lolololol
Comment 216.5	Khadr Trudeau - Oh..... Florida. LOL, that explains a lot.
Comment217	Another Trump success!
Comment 217.1	Yes indeed . Best economy, best employment, America is richer, best military. US has never had it so good.
Comment218	cracked up when he started going on about oil , typical Americans
Comment 218.1	you think isis useD teslas?
Comment 218.2	It&#39;s more to do with the oil dollar trade. The dollar has been pinned to oil since the seventies. The petrodollar. Iraq Libya Syria Venezuela have all tried or did drop the petrodollar in the past. Now Russia China and Iran want to. The US dollar is the OPEC reserve. Keeps the cash flow through the US banks going. So no president is going to back off from that. And none have. Sad.
Comment 218.3	Yeah. I thought was he supposed be talking about oil. I think like a child he&#39;s given so much info and then when he has to address the nation it all spews out.
Comment219	As much as I hate this orange ape, what he did is a slap on the face of Israhell and that&#39;s good
Comment220	This babbling inbecile will happily watch the whole world burn on the pyre of his greed.
Comment 220.1	Jack W - I live in the U.S. and I agree completely.
Comment221	Donald Trump is an inept, corrupt, lying carnival hukster.  I hope the World will forgive the enduring mistake of his election brought on by a mass of disengranchised and not a few uneducated Americans voting for the most different political option they could in order to effect change.  He is an entirely unqualified embarrassment.  He does not speak for the majority of the people of this Country.  We were forced by the election to give him the keys for a test drive, and he&#39;s wrecked it.  No one will miss him.
Comment 221.1	Drake Hound - The majority of Americans — 53% and growing daily — want him impeached and removed.
Comment 221.2	@Ken Brock Same thing I told a Palestinian, you want a country it starts with education.<br />America needs to really start again with their education, not brainwash but education, if they want to fulfill the divine destiny so many hope in America. <br />Now the limited world view and safe space is being used against your fellow Americans.<br />And isolation didn´t work either after ww1 the crime rate and suicide sky rocketed.<br />Atleast back then you had the world to blaim cause they didn´t listen to you.<br />But now you can´t go into isolation cause that would tear the country apart.
Comment 221.3	@Drake Hound Thanks for pointing out the omission.    I meant &quot;not a few.  &quot; Poor education and a limited world view infest American culture.
Comment 221.4	Few uneducated American ? I just saw a mob of 20 Republican storm a Democratic inquire in a secured room. <br />Those sure talk about Millions and Millions of American together with those who watch FOX news.
Comment222	You tried For Kurds but what you did for Kashmiri innocent People still? its been more than 70 days of curfew.
Comment 222.1	Kurds aren&#39;t Muslim extremists. Taliban can fuck right off, the arrogant halfwits.
Comment223	trump is the vilest ambulatory bag of fecal matter in the history of the United States...Hope he contracts colon cancer that takes years of agony to remove him from this world...
Comment 223.1	@tigressnsnow All of them have had issues of one type or another, but the pure slime that this one has covered the country in exceeds all previous ones combined...You are lucky not to be living here...It&#39;s like 1930&#39;s Germany Pt II...
Comment 223.2	“vilest ambulatory bag of fecal matter” — that is great! 😂
Comment 223.3	tigressnsnow - Kitten videos are the only thing keeping us going these days! I DO live in the U.S. and I can tell you that many — if not most — of us feel as if we have PTSD from this constant strife and drama. All the previously closeted bigots of every stripe are suddenly emboldened by this monster. You are correct in pointing out that most past presidents have done some harmful things, even those that thought they were making the best decisions possible, but I have never actually hated a U.S. president before. Trump lacks all common decency, is incapable of any compassion, and is very dangerous. I am ashamed to be an American right now.
Comment 223.4	YES, thank goodness I don&#39;t live in the USA. And YES, I would love to have been living OFF the planet for the past 4yrs or simply not have volunteered in the first place to come to this planet of ADVERSITY. However, it is also a planet of CONTRAST &amp; JOY. Trump acts on behalf of ADVERSITY for us to eventually experience the JOY of him GONE but really concerned at who we might get instead to lead the free world. Past Presidents have always in retrospect been NOT SO GOOD and done bad things like WMD warmongering and corruption. No one is perfect but GEEZ [I think that&#39;s short for &quot;no such thing&quot; Jesus] could Americans find someone decent to vote for not that we have much choice anywhere. Personally I couldn&#39;t recommend any leader past or present. Putin has started to look good to me recently. Now excuse me whilst I go watch Kitten videos to lighten up and experience JOY for some milliseconds :)
Comment224	Fk u
Comment225	Bizarre tripe.
Comment226	Cut the crap!
Comment 226.1	Does anyone actually cut crap? I mean why mess with that stuff?
Comment227	Wow what a sellout..... the deal maker indeed
Comment 227.1	Prove it stupid!!
Comment 227.2	He took the oil.
Comment228	Traveling with his Cohorts<br /> in that Handbasket!
Comment229	trump will decide what happens with the oil reserves in Syria? Isn&#39;t this the same guy who doesn&#39;t want Mexicans and Muslims coming into America to <i>take our stuff?</i>
Comment230	All roads, Pennsylvania Avenue included, leads to Putin. Trump will eventually be gone and the full truth will emerge, whether or not Trump is a traitor.
Comment231	Turkey and Russia made a deal without you. You&#39;ve been bamboozled moron. You didn&#39;t do a damn thing but destroy the kurds. Allow the Turks to use chemical weapons on civilians including children.
Comment232	Did he forget where he was going with that speech a few times...? I&#39;m embarrassed foreign news covered this.
Comment233	Sanctioned for 9 days lol! Did he flip a coin?
Comment 233.1	@gene and aj I believe facts,and the facts are simple: the US did something unacceptable from any point of view. It is morally backrupt and innocent blood has been spilled... like Trump put it, the sands are blood-stained. <br />What else is morally banckrupt? Taking the troops and selling them to Saudi Arabia like they are some sort of private mercenary group. <br />What else is morally backrupt (and insane)? The letter sent by Trump to Turkey.<br />What else is morally backrupt? Trump taking credit for the peace deal made by others.<br />And many other things.
Comment 233.2	You did and lost again!! LMFAO You believe the hate over the facts? Tell me your facts without feelings involved.....
Comment 233.3	@Keith Roy the cease-fire and agreement was not negotiated by Trump. That would be retarded, his letter to Turkey proves this. It was Turkey that made a deal with Russia and Syria while the US bowed down and let it happen (massacre of the Kurds and all)
Comment 233.4	Ben Shaw you don’t seem to understand what our trump supporters/men in uniform can accomplish in 9 days. If you hate this guy you hate our country whether you realize it yet or not fuckin guy will outshine the Kennedy when he croaks.

Comment 237.1	@Bryan Ouellet Before that, Bush read his Christian bible and thought it applied to Muslims.
Comment 237.2	@Khadr Trudeau what happened before that?
Comment 237.3	@Breezy Mods Obama gave us Black Lives Matter, Doubled the Natl Debt., Cash for Clunkers, Lot&#39;s of Muslims slaughtering Americans, High taxes and brutal government regulation, Set race relations back 70 years, Weaponized the CIA and FBI against America.
Comment 237.4	No Prob-llama he doesn’t have too until he has too. Their is such thing as over thinking; the silent majority likes practical solutions that benefit them.. obama did nothing for U.S.
Comment 237.5	@Cyber Crow I don&#39;t think trump knows what Zimbabwe is

Comment240	Trump for president again in 2020 !!! ❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍♥️♥️♥️
Comment 240.1	He’s track record should make him favorite. But everyone still needs to vote
Comment241	Erdogan has something on Trump.
Comment 241.1	2 words.... pee tapes.
Comment242	It&#39;s a shame that most of you dont truly know what&#39;s going on. Most of you think they are killing kurds. That they are against kurds. No, that&#39;s not it. In fact, they have 12 million kurds living in Turkey. Turkey who has has the most Syrian refugees, 2 to 4 million and European counties struggle with thousands. They want to re-settled them to north of Syria, back to their homeland. They want to protect their border, by the pkk, who if you dont know have killed hundreds of Turks in turkey who has also been trained in Syria. They are identified as terrorist by nato, usa, uk and more. Whats wrong with Turkey protecting themselves. They&#39;ve changed their name yet they are the same group. There is video footage of us officials admitting they are the same. It&#39;s not right with replacing terrorist (issis) with another terrorist(pkk). Why do you think trump said they are not Angel&#39;s, that they could be worse than isis. The only reason why no one knows about this is lack of media attention tion and how the media does not explain it. They dont explain why turkey thinks they are terrorist or who else thinks they are territory. Or how they train children to train soldiers or how they attack from holy buildings. Now you tell me, is turkey still doing wrong.
Comment 242.1	Communist Dog  your not weird but smart
Comment 242.2	@RebelDog no no no. So what if they helped to defeat isis. You can never and should never replace terriost with another group of terriost.
Comment 242.3	what Turkey is doing wrong is viewing the Kurdish militias who defeated Isis as an extension of the PKK Kurds. what Turkey is doing wrong is using said immigrants as a threat against interference. and what the west in turn is doing wrong is being afraid of millions of refugees because the west are complete appeasers for right-wing voters and for Erdogan. if you stand for the values you pray for and if you love Turkey - let Erdogan know you are not with him on this one because he’s shaping up to be a dictator
Comment 242.4	Total T you are also weird
Comment 242.5	If only you were 1\4th as smart as you think you are.
Comment243	I think your biggest lier in the world
Comment244	It&#39;s not the &quot;US&quot; it&#39;s only you. It&#39;s only your fault. Please don&#39;t include every american in your mistakes.
Comment 244.1	Queen Elsa - Yes, most Americans — even Republicans — are outraged by this. He wasn’t elected by a majority of voters (hence his insecurity) and a majority now want him impeached and REMOVED.
Comment 244.2	Queen Elsa comment gave me back a little hope in humanity. let him know we’re not with him
Comment245	Ihanks Trump you are right man
Comment246	All this is a clear message to our current and future allies, that message being &#39;You&#39;re better off with Russia than the United States&#39;.
Comment247	A facking hoax by donald &#39; I&#39;ll do or betray anyone for money &#39; trumpy
Comment248	Is Trump trying to tell the federal reserve and the banking families he will not support what could be fraud would it not be if WAR is business?
Comment 248.1	You need to stop watching CNN,BBC etc.... LMFAO
Comment249	Trump organize the kurds massacre, leave Syria to the Russian and remove the sanctions that he declared one week ago because of the media pressure. This country Usa is a huge joke now
Comment 249.1	No Putin just proved to Erodogan he is playing Trump like a violin.
Comment250	HEPİNİZİN ANASINI SİKİCEZ RAHAT OLUN AMCIKLAR
Comment251	Don&#39;t judge him by the rubbish he says, judge him by the things he dose. On that basis it is difficult not to conclude that he is a Russian puppet. Almost every thing Trump does benefits Putin.<br />He has not exactly moved US trumps out of harm&#39;s way, they are now guarding the Iraqi oil against IS fighters, who were until recently prisoners of the Kurds.
Comment252	Oil because American wants it for themselve.. it&#39;s called profit like how American sent there men to Kuwait to Steel there Oil too..
Comment 252.1	@Keith Roy Looks like you always eat west propaganda news everyday buddy
Comment 252.2	You are so completely delusional. America pulled troops out, because they want the oil? You also have never watched real news? Kuwait asked the USA to kick Iraqi troops out. They were the ones that invaded. Also, are you not aware that the USA is also one of the largest producers and exporters of oil? Frankly, many other countries are highly dependent on middle east oil. The USA could easily survive without it, while others would collapse economically, and you seem to be unaware that the nations that export oil GET PAID for it, and are also dependent on that income, or their governemnts would also collapse.<br />Trump also makes the point that fighting has been going on there since long before the USA existed or oil was discovered. Kind of a shallow attempt to divert blame now, lol.
Comment253	What is he blabbing about? He just made a deal to lift the sanctions until they do something we don&#39;t like, what does that mean? Protecting the oil is all you care about isn&#39;t it Trump. This is the biggest nothing deal I&#39;ve ever heard of. He really has no clue how foreign relations work. If he thinks for one second that Turkey isn&#39;t going to go right back to Syria in the near future than he&#39;s nuts. And will someone please get his sinuses fixed or give him a new way to do his drugs because I&#39;m tired of hearing him breathing and sniffing his snot. <br />He&#39;s flipped on his stance on the Kurds three times in the last week. He&#39;s a disgrace.

Comment256	When is the BBC going to lift it&#39;s sanction, known as the TV licence fee, on the British public?
Comment 256.1	Just don&#39;t pay it.<br />Simple.
Comment 256.2	@Joe Brooks Not when the threat of £1,000 fine for not paying it is included in the &#39;subscription&#39;...even if you don&#39;t watch TV.
Comment 256.3	@Joe Brooks a forced subscription. Even if you don&#39;t watch BBC, you still have to pay the licence fee if your TV can pick up live programs on any channel. No other subscription outlet does the same
Comment 256.4	When sky, virgin, fox, Netflix’s, Amazon, do. And have you seen how Fox News lie. But then they own the scum news paper. YNWA 96.
Comment 256.5	@stop Mass Hysteria TV liscense is a subscription pretty much

Comment 276.1	Wow
Comment277	BIJI KURDISTAN ☀️
Comment 277.1	nature albums the Kurds have been in the area before the Romans took over. they still exist, while a united Kurdistan doesn’t. they defeated Isis and here is their claim. by your logic “the one with the balls lays the claim” they have one. <br />regional powers aren’t willing to give up those lands for oil.
Comment 277.2	@nature albums we are about 40million not 20. And yeah that is correct but guess what, the ottoman empire was defeated by the brits, so brits shouldve decided on the borders from your logic, which they did but ataturk made a deal with brits and so brits did nit create a kurdish country. Both brits and ottomans had promised a homeland back then if they helped but guess what, they got backstabbed by both. Turkey would be weak without its kurds, about 30% of turkey is kurdish plus all the other kurds from iraq, iran, syria that would almost be equal to the amount of turks. And yeah most turks are genetically greek and stuff cause those are the peoples lands they conqoured. In the past ottomans had a lot of help from the kurds. But now they are treated bad by turks.<br /><br />Slowly us kurds will unite and rise to form a free kurdish country, away from oppressors and tyrants like erdogan. Iraq has already gained autonomy, they even have a stromg military that could match up to iraq. Soon all the other kurds will follow. And then we will see what you say then. Kurds honestly deserve a homeland, without kurds isis would still be around many would be killed. We sacrificed our people for the protection of all our middle eastern brothers but some of them like turkey backstabbed us while we were defending them. You lot attacked us while we were defending north syria from isis and driving them out.
Comment 277.3	@-Chairs- British tried to carve the land but it was Turkish even before British was British.. What Kurds don&#39;t understand is who  has the balls claims the land. If Persia had the strength at the time Turkey would be Persia or before them the big balls were with the Byzantines in fact I&#39;m genetically Greek/Macedonian but Turk we are mixed Genetically go get a DNA test and we can talk later it is a good job our 20 million Kurds don&#39;t go around Biji Biji or we would end up fkd up like Iraq or Syria....
Comment 277.4	@nature albums turkey number 2 in germany is a dumb example you gave me. Do turks have history in that area? No. So it is not justifiable to say that it should be turkey even if a part of germany is filled with a majority of turks
Comment278	Oh good its turkey for christmas
