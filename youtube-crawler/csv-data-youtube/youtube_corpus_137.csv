Comment13	god loves peaceful people the others do not do any violence - erdokhan, it certainly does not belong to so few dangers
Comment14	It&#39;s a shame that most of you dont truly know what&#39;s going on. Most of you think they are killing kurds. That they are against kurds. No, that&#39;s not it. In fact, they have 12 million kurds living in Turkey. Turkey who has has the most Syrian refugees, 2 to 4 million and European counties struggle with thousands. They want to re-settled them to north of Syria, back to their homeland. They want to protect their border, by the pkk, who if you dont know have killed hundreds of Turks in turkey who has also been trained in Syria. They are identified as terrorist by nato, usa, uk and more. Whats wrong with Turkey protecting themselves. They&#39;ve changed their name yet they are the same group. There is video footage of us officials admitting they are the same. It&#39;s not right with replacing terrorist (issis) with another terrorist(pkk). Why do you think trump said they are not Angel&#39;s, that they could be worse than isis. The only reason why no one knows about this is lack of media attention tion and how the media does not explain it. They dont explain why turkey thinks they are terrorist or who else thinks they are territory. Or how they train children to train soldiers or how they attack from holy buildings. Now you tell me, is turkey still doing wrong.
Comment15	Fuck erdogan 🖕🏻🇹🇷

He gave him a ear full of his rambling Trump nonsense we all know from his campaign rallies and now thats caused a tragic global incident.

Comment 25.1	Love and respect because your Syrian refugee brothers and sisters are getting treated better by Turkey&#39;s leader than the average Turkish citizen. I know this for a fact because a Syrian refugee told it to me.
Comment26	Let’s go Erdogan 💪
Comment 26.1	FUCK UR MOM
Comment27	Erdogan is accusing the west of doing stuff behind his back. Like what? He just wants to keep his protesters quiet.
Comment 27.1	"Here you go. It has now become a daily part of life in Turkey. Gone are the days of free speech, thinking, and decision making. <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49613074"">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49613074</a>"
Comment28	THIS is what does NOT make sense, logic, reason, and sanity unless of course the real end objective is to occupy. Turkey has said they are forming a buffer zone of 480km ( 300 miles ) long and 30km ( 20 miles ) deep, into Syria, along its southern border with Syria. They also say that once the 4 million or so Syrian refugees in Turkey are settled in this buffer zone, they will provide them with houses, schools, electricity, water, health, etc while at the same time claiming that they currently are not receiving enough outside funding to cover all the expenses of the refugees currently in Turkey. This is hypocrisy unless the goal is occupancy.<br /><br />Doing so gets Turkey that much closer to eastern Syria oil fields. This Turkish leader has said, on occasion, that this was territory stolen during the regression of the Ottoman empire. Unlike any leader Turkey has had since it was formed in 1923, after the collapse of the Ottoman empire, this leader is the first to surface as neo-Ottoman.

Comment36	"What will Turkey&#39;s tyrant do when he confronts Russian forces on his border ? The Russians, Syrian forces, and Kurds have struck a deal to protect Syria&#39;s northern territory. This is what Putin had wanted all along - get U.S. troops out of that region so that he could move in, and Turkey&#39;s tyrant became the fall guy. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpoabnN-OXw"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpoabnN-OXw</a>"

Comment57	"You can watch 🇹🇷 <a href=""https://youtu.be/O5on4M2aYdg"">https://youtu.be/O5on4M2aYdg</a>"
Comment 57.1	Tamam be ... uzatma artık ! ... YAPILANA KATILIYORUM, YAPANA ASLA KATILMIYORUM !!!!
Comment58	ALSO NOTE THIS ... there are Turkish trolls here and elsewhere telling people like me ( who is an ETHNIC Turk; not just Turkish ) to shut the hell up. The one thing you need to know about the Turkish leader and his gang of thugs is that they operate in utter secrecy. They definitely don&#39;t want any infidels, as they like to refer to, or any others outside of Turkey to know what they are actually doing or the truth to be disclosed. For speaking-up the penalty is being labeled, if they can&#39;t get to you, or imprisonment if they can. That&#39;s why those who weren&#39;t so fortunate are now sitting in Turkish prisons. Their philosophy is: - out of sight, out of mind.
Comment59	Just kill Kurds
Comment60	Go on erdogan love from Bangladesh
Comment61	The reporter is misleading people on purpose....its not the kurds turkey is fighting,its pkk and ypG..UN designated terrorist organizations
Comment 61.1	You are correct because 20 - 25% of Turkey&#39;s population are Kurds who are citizens of Turkey ( Turkish ). Turkish is defined as being a citizen of the country of Turkey. It does not necessarily mean a person is of Turk ethnic origin. As an example ... a person can be a citizen of Germany but it does not necessarily mean they are of German ethnic origin.
Comment62	If I was in a power position I would destroy Turkey and make it the 51th state.
Comment 62.1	@ZOOOPY The Byzantines were tough to begin with. They were part of the eastern Roman empire.
Comment 62.2	@S. Mesut Whatever they are they killed millions, Greeks - Armenians - Cyprians and now Syrians.. EVIL COUNTRY!
Comment 62.3	Remember that only 22% of the population are of the original Central Asian Turks that settled into Asia Minor ( Anatolia ). The majority of Turkey&#39;s population are Byzantines who were converted to Islam, Turkish culture, and language. DNA studies have shown this and even some Turkish scholars have stated it. This is why you will see a mix of blonde, red, dark hair, blue to dark eye color, and white to brown skin colored people in the population.
Comment63	The devil is looking, acting, and proceeding more like Saddam with each passing day. Even his own people now live in fear. ... More than 300-thousand already sit in Turkish prisons and the number keeps rising. Anyone dissenting, journalists, educators, political figures, even military officers, etc are sitting locked-up. This is a fact; not fiction in current day Turkey under the present leadership which has now been in control for 18 years. A true regression from what the founder of Turkey ( Ataturk ) had ever envisioned or could have imagined.
Comment 63.1	@M A YAPILANA KATILIYORUM, YAPANA ASLA KATILMIYORUM !!!! İKİNİZ DE BELA VE BERBATSINIZ. BİR DOĞRU YOL VARDI ( ATATÜRK&#39;ÜN YOLU ) VE ONU BOZDUNUZ. DOMUZSUNUZ !

Comment78	This man is no different than Hitler!
Comment79	In addition to releasing 1000s of Daesh prisoners, PKK/YPG deliberately targeted civilians, including reporters, near the Turkish-Syrian border before striking a dirty deal with the Assad regime. Turkey will combat all terrorist groups whether or not the world supports our efforts.
Comment80	America supporting something should be cause for  enough concern. i mean, when is the last time America made a good decision in regards to the middle eastern?

Comment 86.2	@Daniel Edmonds  گبخ gw bxooo fuck kardoghan
Comment 86.3	@TLOMe why did you make that comment? whats the point?
Comment 86.4	NATO is a mutual defense treaty.  Turkey is a member and the U.S. has a base and nuclear weapons there.
Comment87	So they don&#39;t want to talk and sort out their clashes with the Kurds yet they want to India to sort out issues in Kashmir. Great work Erdogan &quot;no mood&quot; for compromise.
Comment 87.1	what a pathetic comparison with a Nazi loving fascist regime in India.<br /><br />When was the last time anyone negotiated with Hitler!?<br /><br />Oh you are a fool.
Comment88	Well the world can put the blame on the White House doorsteps for what is going on in Syria he’s now starting to sell his own allies out for personal, financial and political favours well done Donald the world knew that we could rely on you to fuck it completely all he’s done is given Turkey and Russia a very early Christmas present he’s the biggest threat to world peace since Hitler and trump has more destructive weapons than Hitler and that makes trump more dangerous than Hitler
Comment89	A small American contingency of Special Forces (about 30 soldiers) cannot take an entire Turkish Army so yeah it was smart of Trump to pull them out. It would have been a slaughter and it takes time and money to gather thousands of troops and equipment for deployment. That does not happen overnight and situation has to be assessed. Reality is that plenty of ISIS have kidnapped and forced Kurds to fight for them. Syria has been in a civil war for over 7 years now (let&#39;s not even mention the thousands of years of conflict in mid East. When one ends another starts practically overnight). Syria was weakened ISIS came in. We fought alongside the KURDS but we cannot stay in that country forever. I remember when people screamed when we finally pulled most of our forces out if Iraq then they yelled when we pulled out of Afghanistan after Bin laden killed in Pakistan (another problem child country).  We cannot stay in all these mid East countries forever-- at some point they have to take over and protect their own country. The US cannot protect the world.<br />Now that doesn&#39;t excuse what Turkey did but Turkey and Syria have been at odds before, this isn&#39;t the first time nor will it be the last. With that being said Turks need to be sanctioned 1st and if they don&#39;t respond then a coalition (military from numerous countries including us) should go in. But the cost to American lives and $$$$ should not only fall on the United States. It should be a shared responsibility otherwise we risk a war with Turkey.
Comment90	Turkey you&#39;re doing great, you&#39;re cleaning the mess U.S. and its allies has left behind.

Comment119	&quot;This is the most active front line&quot; So let me just stand there on this hill while I get caught with a stray bullet or piece of shrapnel
Comment 119.1	By the way, these smokes are not from the artillery fire.. PKK burns tires to prevent visions of drones of Turkey.
Comment 119.2	Is all lies propaganda
Comment120	You know that those are tires burning in back right?? It was set on fire just for the news agencies seek of drama.
Comment 120.1	No, it is a PKK tactic to block the view of the Turkish armed unmanned aerial vehicles or drones. That&#39;s how Turkey can pinpoint the exaxt target with minimum civilian losses.
Comment 120.2	Ovuvuevuevue Enyetuenwuevue Ugbemugbem Osas ... I don’t know for sure, but I would not bet against it... Why these biased media not showing the video for these terrorists releasing ISIS prisoners in spite of US?

Comment124	British government informs!<br />German Lidl invests more than $ 19 billion in the UK economy<br />Brexit is a powerful result ...
Comment125	Euro-american media propagate Marxist ypg militants as heroes all for geopolitical interest.  They don&#39;t care about civilians deaths. Look how euro-american establishment destroyed mosul,raqqa and ramadi. They eliminated both innocent life and their livelihoods. Yet they criticise turkey who want to make safe zone for 4 million refugees.
Comment 125.1	Ibrahim Somali biased media... Funny thing is that no noise coming from Israel... Any of you realized this? I guess they are planning on what to call the next terrorist group they will be creating... Oh, cannot be ISIS, sorry, you used that previously...
Comment126	So war with SAA who is backed by Russia? Ero you are a fool, a madman addicted to power.
Comment127	Good job Turkey.  giving the refugees their right to return to Syria with dignity,  protecting national security and not occupying others land like that of US and EU. <br />And Turkey is not doing this Illegally. There is a agreement called &quot;Adana agreement&quot; Between Syria and Turkey which western media never mention. <br />I salute Erdogan.
Comment 127.1	​@Avi Chetri there was no official political kurd territory in syria. BTW, they push refuges to north, to Turkey in order to maintain their control over demography. <br />All West media is telling lies about this issue. It is unbelievable to watch this... I really had trusted the values of western civilizations but now I really feel cheated. They are being hypocrites..:<br />BTW, yes Erdogan is another populist leader just like Trump. But right now he is right and EU and US are giving him the arguments for his propaganda. They let erdoğan use these arguements and that&#39;s a shame.<br />Turks want peace in northern syria so that 4 millions refuges can go back their lands.
Comment 127.2	Erdogan is on the righr path here,its got nothing to do with kurds its the kurdish terrorists groups that their after
Comment 127.3	What about the Kurds and their territories?
Comment128	Trump is a traitor and a coward. Hope Putin’s cock still tastes good from a jail cell, Dickstain Donnie.
Comment129	Another big shift in international strategy, thanks To Putins BFF Trump.
Comment 129.1	+downhilltwofour00  Yep.  A move towards diplomacy - hence the negotiated ceasefire in Northern Syria - instead of war.  Thanks to Trump listening to his voters instead of politicians beholden to defense contractors.  Our mission in the area was to reclaim land from ISIS with the Kurds.  Not to fight for land for them belonging to the sovereign nations of Syria and our NATO ally Turkey whom we have a mutual defense agreement with via NATO.  Not to mention we have a base in Turkey and store nuclear weapons. I would bet most of the people vomiting regugitated media talking points at the behest of the paid off politicians on Twitter don&#39;t know most of what I have said in this thread.  And if they do, don&#39;t dare call liberals.
Comment 129.2	@TLOMe I wasn&#39;t referring to a shift by Putin. We in America know his strategy. I&#39;m referring in a big shift caused in America by Trump.

Comment142	turks do have a history of genocide
Comment 142.1	@Big Smoke <br />Youve presented nothing but opinions &amp; weak justifications for what was done.<br /><br />I dont hate Turkey. I think Erdogan is a dickhead though. Turks are a proud nationalistic people and I greatly respect and admire that as an American.<br /><br />However... 100 years ago, Turks slaughtered Armenians. End of story.<br /><br />Not sure why you cant accept that?<br /><br />America withstood its past... Germany accepted the holocaust...<br />Turkey can survive this... <br />But the denial and feigned ignorance is both insulting and embarrassing
Comment 142.2	"@your mom You&#39;re an ignorant man.All you could do was make me <a href=""http://laugh.no/"">laugh.No</a> matter how much evidence we give you, you won&#39;t accept it.We presented historians and you liars didn&#39;t accept.Need I say anything else?Do you have a reason to believe that Turkey&#39;s didn&#39;t make <a href=""http://genocide.you/"">genocide.You</a> hate Turkey.And you&#39;re afraid of the Turks, even if you don&#39;t admit it.I have an Armenian neighbor and we have dinner together sometimes.Don&#39;t get involved in this,you coward pig"
Comment 142.3	@P4RDUS <br />Yes, the white man moved into native lands... Fought them for it and won... Over many years... <br /><br />Then yes, deals were made and then violated. Many treaties still stand to this day and many tribal nations have much autonomy.<br /><br />But what we did NOT do was round up millions of them and murder them.<br /><br />Not to excuse the mistreatment they did indeed suffer... But they got a far better deal than the Armenians did
Comment 142.4	@P4RDUS <br /><br />Lived side by side. Then Turks slaughtered them. The end.<br /><br />Talking to you is like talking to a flat earther or a holocaust denier.<br /><br />Make up all the shit you want to justify it... But at the end day millions of Armenians, men women and children, were systematically murdered.

Comment158	We still have an Air base there. Media will make up anything for a b.s. story...
Comment 158.1	Yes... Media also portrays these terrorists as “Kurds”... Turkey has 15-20 million Kurds as citizens. If the purpose was to kill Kurds, Turkey does not need an operation outside its borders. Besides, why would Turkey want to kill Kurds. Turks and Kurds live together safely in Turkey. The problem is these terrorists kidnapping Kurds and others and forcing them to fight for them. At leas 28 of these kidnapped people surrender to Turkey in past 7 days...
Comment 158.2	Starscream the air base is just being used to exit with all the equipment but the US is officially out if the war
Comment159	You know, Tsargrad does have a nice ring to it.

Comment174	When u lose your leg to save a finger.
Comment 174.1	@alexander atur Because they are not granted the sovereignty they wish for.. that is the base cause of the many deaths on both sides. Kurds have created their YPG and PKK to realise this in a terroristic manner. Turkey simply responds to that by defending their nation in what ever way necessary.
Comment 174.2	@Troelala You say the Kurds ll seek revenge,  wonder why?
Comment 174.3	Clearly both of you don&#39;t understand that this is a mission based on long term decisions. Terroristic kurds having their own nation would allow them to organize themselfs and create a greater risk. The hate in the hearts of the turks towards the kurds and the other way around will probably never be gone. Just as with the palestinians and the israeli&#39;s. Kurds are free to live in Syria, Irak or Turkey without any differentiation between them and the native people. They are just not allowed to create their own nation, a dream which was shattered many years ago and which they do not give up. Is it truely strange for a nation to act when their national security is in danger? Is it strange that Turkey also refuses to give up in order to protect their sovereignty? Do you really think a Kurdistan would be a peace resolution to all of this? Do you really think that when the kurds have their own large scale armies, infrastructure and high-tech technology that they would not seek revenge? One of the reasons for the invasion is to prevent this situation to ever start but many do not see it, they are blinded by the media. Neither sides have done good, but a kurdish nation must be prevented at all costs to prevent bigger issues in the future. If that means that you have to &#39;&#39;lose a leg&#39;&#39; to &#39;&#39;save a finger&#39;&#39;, so be it. It just means you don&#39;t understand that this is about much more than just creating a save haven for the Syrian refugees.

Comment 196.2	Munde Rex I totally agree because this is actually what it is. Low IQ sheep men think to kick Turkey out of nato solves things out.
Comment 196.3	Having Turkey in benefits Nato for strategic regions, one Turkey is the second-largest army in Nato. Second,  they control the Bosporus straits which keeps Russia&#39;s black fleet from expanding out into the oceans which the US doesn&#39;t ever want! Third, if war to ever be broke out against or from Russia, Turkey&#39;s eastern border will act as a second front to Russia. Kicking Turkey out of Nato is just asking Turkey to ally with Russia, that&#39;ll make situations worse than it is right now.

Carry on supporting those so called noble soldiers that are indeed one of the many plans of America to create chaos when needed. I am writing this thinking that you might learn something of worthy inside your whole empty life that only contains barbaric thoughts and an ideology of torturing innocent for not fighting alongside you. Take my word Erdogan is just a president of Turkey that would leave its place to another in future, but no matter who the president is the noble Turkish army AND the Turkish nation will fight until the last drop of their blood and will become victorius no matter how much you try. We have proven this at the past, let&#39;s not play this again. Peace at home peace in World. We will not stop until the peace is accomplished. Night

Comment230	Turkey is fighting against internationaly listed terrorist organisation PKK, which killed thousends of people mostly by suicide attacks. You can call PKK whatever you like, may it be YPG, XYZ or iny, mini, miny, mo. Turkey is fighting against terrorists and has no intention to hurt civilians or syrian country. Western countries are supporting terrorism in Iraq and Syria since i do not when. Enough is enough. Turkey is not shelling Kurds or kurdish cities. We are shelling terrorist puppets of the big boss, that is why the whole european media is so mad.
Comment231	"Turkey good luck <br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Turkey_relations"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Turkey_relations</a>"
Comment232	because HE KNOWS the amer. prez is a pussy!
Comment233	I don&#39;t know or try to keep up with all that fighting in the mid east<br /> but what was they doing before America showed up,,  fighting <br />what was they doing after America showed up,   fighting,<br />what was they doing after America left,  fighting.    that&#39;s all I know about it, <br />but I trust in our president Trump will do what he feels is the right thing to do,  what ever he says. I support him, <br />And they want to blame him. for the problems. they&#39;ve had. since before any of us was even born.<br /> it&#39;s like a bunch of tn. hillbillies feuding so long they don&#39;t no longer know why those in Tennessee are still fighting, <br />And shut your mouth. Tennessee, I&#39;m a hillbilly from tennessee, I say it if I want to.
Comment 233.1	Typical retarded american 😒
Comment 233.2	If you can read you might want to brush up on basic mid-east history and realize that the region was relatively stable until oil and the Jewish question threw the region into turmoil at the end of the second world war. The wests need for oil as a strategic necessity and our backing of the Jewish state are at the heart of these wars.
Comment234	The Turkey dictator at it again.<br />He&#39;s only starting this war because he lost Istanbul&#39;s mayoral elections and is starting to lose support nationwide.
Comment235	well turkey is clearly working against NATO goals .
Comment 235.1	NATO worked, it won. Should have ended in 1990.
Comment 235.2	@Geraldo Olivier as a turk i hate erdogan&#39;s stupid policy because of that. I do not know where u are from but can you say the same for western countries? Erdogan&#39;s policy does not change the reality that turkish army is fighting terrorist organisations like pkk or ypg. And overall islamic state was also an outcome of iraq war. So all nato countries are to blame when it comes to that, not just Turkey.
Comment 235.3	P4RDUS considering Mr erdogan quite obscure policy / relation with daesh ... better not talk about terrorism. That would bring greater suspicion about mr erdogan s real goal.
Comment 235.4	Trump literally wanted to pull out of NATO. Every move they’ve made has been about dismantling the western led world order. Weakening it in a thousand, thousand ways.
Comment 235.5	Nato&#39;s goals include supporting terrorism? Thn ofc we are working against. PKK and YPG were bombing civilian turkish cities near the border. UN, EU or USA do not listen us at all. So we do what needs to be done by ourselves.

Comment 248.3	Was I born a dick
Comment 248.4	@Nick Nguyen Selling out the Vietnamese won the Democrat party the congress and president . This after Nixon had destroyed them at the polls. Watch Kerry laugh about his 1500 dead promise. Today you spout their talking points. ie &#39; Trump made money&quot; shame on you.
Comment 248.5	Trump is a corrupt, impotent, self serving man who learned how to mislead others early in his career to achieve his personal wants... His capitulation to Turkey by withdrawing was most likely based on the fact his &#39;crown jewel&#39; hotels are in Turkey..... Trump relinguinshed our role as a world leader in exchange for his financial gain and ego.  I am absolutely flabbergasted that Turkey feels empowered to push off a US vice president..but that was all this administrations doing... I think the US has decent people with decent values that can help the world in general.  Our very lamentable selection of a small minded demagogue will damage our ability to effect change for a more stable and equitable world society...definitely not our greatest moment.
