Comment1	Lebanese women are a little butter<br /><br />These people seem proud to have remained in the feudal age, almost out of the stone age
Comment2	Why are they so &quot;proud to be Lebanese&quot;? What has Lebanon ever contributed to the world? What&#39;s so special about it?! It&#39;s just another Arab country with values that belong to the medieval time.

Comment 23.2	@Marwan Lebnani do you really think we like them? They are hezbo al shaytan
Comment 23.3	Hezbollah is the number one enemy of Lebanon. They are controlling all the drugs and money from it from the Bakka all the way to Europe, from the millions they make out of this criminal activities they pay Lebanese politicians to be quite and to do what Hezbollah tells them to do. Iran &amp; Hezbollah  are the real master of Lebanon now and people are sick of it.

Comment 27.1	obvious troll fuck off.
Comment28	Please make more videos about demonstrators in developed countries like UK USA Spain Israel and etc...
Comment 28.1	BBC Youtube totally ignored the million plus demonstration against brexit in London recently.
Comment 28.2	The protest of the lebanese people has spread to over 50 countries because of the large diaspora of lebanese in the world (14 million lebanese abroad while only 4.5 million lebanese in Lebanon) so yeah it&#39;s safe to say that even if we aren&#39;t a first world country our voice matters

Comment31	Hezbollah will say it is plan by Israel üòÇ
Comment 31.1	@Danny J. You are talking crap, although it seems that &quot;Lebanon is not ruled by Iran&quot; unlike you, most people are not dumb and are brave enough to say what is relay bothering them. Iran pulls all the strings from Tehran and thats a fact! Israel will not exploit the turmoil coz Israel has no plan to conquer Lebanon, they have plenty of their own problems and all this talk of Israel  sounds very Iranian....Lebanon is not a democracy and the Hezbollah was not chosen by anyone apart from the ones they pay money to....
Comment 31.2	@Marwan Lebnani Lebanon is not ruled by Iran. Iran doesn&#39;t rig elections or the political process. The Shiites in Lebanon, including som Sunnis and Christians also support Hezbollah. It&#39;s a legitimate politcal party. It seems weird that all the blame is directed towards them, even though they don&#39;t rule the nation. Israel and SA will exploit the turmoil to neuter Hezbollah, which it sees as a threat.
Comment 31.3	Iran is always taking BS
Comment 31.4	@negro bsr Yes I know, Iran government needs some one to blame for the miserable lives of it people.....

Comment 39.1	I don‚Äôt like BBC much either but trust me this video is 100% correct
Comment 39.2	I didn&#39;t understand what u said completely but....<br />What&#39;s happening in Lebanon is real and is the right thing...<br />They didn&#39;t fake or said anything wrong in the video
Comment40	lebanese people follow the gov&#39;t rules!!!!! And I&#39;m proud to be a American
Comment 40.1	American or indo American
Comment41	wait so what exactly is going on?
Comment 41.1	So a group of people stared protesting against new imposed taxes(supposedly ti fix the financial and economical crisis that they have freaking caused) like 6$ a month on whatsapp which is ridiculous because they don&#39;t even own whatsapp and we are already paying a lot of taxes and we never get anything in returns we don&#39;t even have electricity for the whole day for God&#39;s sake and we need to pay for generators and all. Anyways a convoy of a minister went straight through the protest and the body guard stared shooting a machine gun in the air to stop protestors which made the people angry (a women kicked the body guard in the nuts to stop him) bits by bits people started coming down to the streets to voice their opinion with no regards to their religion or political party (finally) and now there are 2 million lebanese in the streets (from a 4.5 million population) demanding for the resignation of the government because no one trusts them anymore and they&#39;ve stolen from us and made us miserable one too many times. Also a factor that helped build up the tension is the way the government was uneffective while &quot;handling&quot; massive wildfires last week. We&#39;ve had enough i can&#39;t even express in words how much i hate this government because they are ruining my country the country i love and we aren&#39;t going to stop until they leave the office, we want a transitional government to organize new elections for a new government to form, we want effective and educated candidates that don&#39;t come form legacy. The thing is the economical crisis in Lebanon isn&#39;t hard to manage but these politicians only care about what&#39;s in for them and about how they are going to steal all our money. So yeah it&#39;s safe to say we&#39;ve had enough. To top it all the political parties who are in charge of the government are sending their supporters to the streets to disturb the protests and cause mayhem and that caused a lot of unnecessary injuries and brutality in order to discredit the protestors so yeah they&#39;re going down
Comment42	Proud to be British Bullshit Corp.

Comment44	I feel so proud to be English.  England is f~cking number one, mate!  We invented and discovered everything and conquered a third of the globe.  We also beat all the maddest dictators and still had time to abolish slavery and improve rights for women and children.  We are better than anyone.  England is better.
Comment 44.1	Alf Garnett don‚Äôt forget. <br /><br />Two world wars<br />One World Cup<br /><br />Doo-daa
Comment45	BBC keep turning their comments off, because most people don&#39;t agree with their propaganda nonsense.  I&#39;m not talking about the subject of this video, but the latest two.  Vile globalist BBC, enemy of the people.  We like Brexit, Trump will win in 2020 and everything else you don&#39;t like, BBC.

Comment 53.3	@Evan Richards oh good grief...
Comment54	It&#39;s not a protest, it&#39;s a party. They&#39;re celebrating and they have fun.
Comment55	Britney spears is incredible
Comment56	It&#39;s a wonderful thing to see young people coming together, standing up for inequality, dictatorships, police States, crooked politicians, Exedra Exedra. The problem is that people are now starting to realize just how unequal Society really is. These people at the top, no matter how they get there, weather it&#39;s democratically-elected, a military coup, or even a royal succession, get a taste for power and realize how intoxicating money is, and once they have it all, Fayetteville f*<b>***</b> intention of giving it back. Did they use whatever means necessary to keep it... They hijack charity, religion, the internet, and most importantly, the hearts and minds of the ignorant. And I&#39;m not just some loudmouth, hypocritical American. The world right now it&#39;s about to explode, in these people will do anything, even elect that f*<b>***</b> lying, parasite Trump. And believe me either the poor and the downtrodden will rise and try to at least get more of the scraps the rich and Powerful leave them to fight over, or we can just be smarter than them, and stop pretending these people in charge represent them... We&#39;re in a lot of trouble
Comment 56.1	Agreed. These people in my country are protesting just to have their minimal rights and just to live like any normal people, they are so sick of dying before hospitals because of the extremely expensive medical care. People are now aware of the corrupt government, they have woken up.
Comment57	Purple eating anal  fires      ....
Comment58	BBC deleting comments because it doesn&#39;t fit their islamic narrative.<br />BBC openly supports islamic jihad!
Comment59	Why protesting is happening. It is also happening on Hong Kong (HK).
Comment 59.1	If your a Filipino you better learn about the communist party of China
Comment 59.2	Philippines K.K.K <br />It‚Äôs alright, not a lot of people know. In Lebanon it‚Äôs become 99% of the people along with the military against a group of billionaire oligarch politicians that are over 80 years old.
Comment 59.3	"@A Ok I think I being pretty stupid because I did not understand Hong Kong&#39;s Protest until Lebanon&#39;s Protest I just heard it on Inside Edition with protesters singing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BabyShark"">#BabyShark</a> to a baby."
Comment 59.4	Philippines K.K.K <br />There‚Äôs a huge difference between Lebanon and HK, Lebanon‚Äôs protests are an actual civic populist revolt, whereas HK it‚Äôs just a bunch of college students being pushed by the US.
Comment60	BBC is a terrorist based news agency
Comment 60.1	Keep reporting bbc for promoting terrorism.
Comment61	It‚Äôs funny to me when western media only show the brown people in a multi-ethnic country........<br />Last time I was in a Lebanese school, most of the class had fair complexions and half the class had blue or green eyes while all the brown people (the minority) were called ‚Äúfarmers‚Äù behind their back.
Comment 61.1	@Sasha Libanova i am lebanese and i am not arab most lebanese deny that they are arab and you are right i agree with you it all depends on the area though most muslims here are from direct arabian decent
Comment 61.2	Arabs in the Lavant (and generally most Arabs) are white, many have tan tones due to middetarian sun exposure, just like Italians, and just like upscale Californians (when you are out in the sun, you get a tan, eh). Having said that, all people of all colours are equal. NO to racism.
Comment 61.3	Resistance 313 Arab is not a race. Lebanese people are Caucasian and some are brown, some are white, some are tan. It varies. You can‚Äôt say that all Lebanese are Arab, because that is not true. Many have European or African ancestry not Gulf Arab
Comment 61.4	Jana Najd I am not saying ALL Lebanese! I was speaking about MY experience.
Comment 61.5	Resistance 313 True Arabs are from the gulf peninsula. You‚Äôre funny if you think Lebanese are ‚Äútrue‚Äù Arabs. Absolutely delusional. You call me an idiot yet you think Arab is a race. Wow funny, do your research
Comment62	Dear BBC,<br /><br />Social media is for discussion. <br /><br />If you&#39;re going to post videos but turn off comments all you are doing is dictating a narrative. <br /><br />You have your own TV and radio stations to push your agendas unchallenged. <br /><br />That&#39;s not how social media works. <br /><br />What are you afraid of? <br /><br />Why don&#39;t you want to hear the views of those who are forced to pay your wages?
Comment 62.1	@Thrill Hou <br /><br />Not really,  as they select most of the questions asked.<br /><br />There&#39;s a very narrow selection of topics.
Comment 62.2	Arfur Fuxxakes they hear the opinion of the great unwashed every week on question time. <br /><br />That‚Äôs probably why they occasionally turn off comments. <br /><br />üòÇ
Comment 62.3	BBC is worried that we can comment on the fake news and make the lies clear. They are afraid of the truth.<br />Welcome in 1984 at his best.
Comment 62.4	Arfur Fuxxakes well said
Comment63	I like how bbc picks and choses when comments are enabled. Some videos we are not allowed an opinion?
Comment 63.1	Go complain to ofcom üòÇ
Comment 63.2	@The Real Maskriz &lt; yet here you are freely saying what you want to say right now..... how does that work?
Comment 63.3	It&#39;s their publication and their editorial. <br />I always give a thumbs down whenever there is no comment available whatever the content of the publication article.<br />And, for instance,  you don&#39;t get a thumbs up for having Napoleon Bonaparte as your icon because he reintroduced slavery to France after the French revolution.<br />If I could I would give you a negative thumb for having that icon if it were possible.
Comment 63.4	Report them for promoting terrorism.
Comment64	Nothing will happen, these people will go back to their belly dancing and eating humus with no results. Mark my words.
Comment 64.1	Marwan Lebnani <br />You‚Äôre such a prejudiced Sunni moron where you‚Äôre putting the entire blame of Lebanon‚Äôs problems on Hezbollah. Why don‚Äôt you talk a bit about the crooks from your side?
Comment 64.2	Hezbollah is the number one enemy of Lebanon. They are controlling all the drugs and money from it from the Bakka all the way to Europe, from the millions they make out of this criminal activities they pay Lebanese politicians to be quite and to do what Hezbollah tells them to do. Iran &amp; Hezbollah  are the real master of Lebanon now and people are sick of it.
Comment 64.3	@A Be careful what you wish for my friend. The French Revolution wasn&#39;t really flawless. I agree with you that peaceful protests never achieved anything. There needs to be a more proactive approach to the revolution. The last thing this country needs is guillotined heads being paraded around Martyrs Square. We need to draw the good from the French Revolution and leave out the bad. The looming question is whether the people are truly ready to fight for what they are protesting for. If so, a pseudo-Tennis Court Oath is the way to start.
Comment 64.4	Nareg Terzian <br />Honestly it was 100 times more fun when we were burning tires and blocking ALL the roads, instead of this pg13 carnival crap. French Revolution is the solution, but let‚Äôs see if the people here have the balls for it, keep in mind all our oligarchs are well protected by the army + private security.
Comment 64.5	Nothing will happen so far as these protests continue they way they&#39;re going. There is no organisation whatsoever. It&#39;s the same every day now; roadblock, people joining in, the same demands throughout the day. That&#39;s fine but how about some of them be proactive for a change and come up with a solution. Take a page from the French Revolution and have your own Tennis Court Oath. Write up a new constitution that meets the demands of the majority and go on from there. The government is definitely going to reject it but you can at least have something to hold on to from there. Since the people are rejecting the government and all it&#39;s facets then have your own elections without the approval of the government in power. It is a risk but at least it&#39;s a step.

Comment66	Yet one million plus demonstration against brexit doesn&#39;t get reported by the BBC. Why is this BBC?
Comment 66.1	@Danny J. nothing to do with the Youtube user demographics then... i.e. inspiring yet more protests globally. The BBC is an establishment organ. It doesn&#39;t matter what colour rosette the political party in government has. Their gain is the gain of establishment confidence in their following the establishment&#39;s line and their profit in that corporation remaining solvent due to the establishment holding the purse strings.
Comment 66.2	Because they don&#39;t gain from it. If Brexit was profitable, BBC would more likely support Brexit.
Comment 66.3	@Name Last not reported in their Youtube account. A story as big as that not reported in this branch of the BBC. Was that decision political?

Comment69	Austerity?<br /><br /><br />Rich people are luxury WE can no longer afford.
Comment 69.1	@Pol Mak standard of living has fallen much lower than has been recorded previously in 50 plus years here in the UK. People in jobs isn&#39;t a measure of wealth or poverty. Slaves are all employed. And what I am saying here applies to everyone including the people of Lebanon.
Comment 69.2	R√¶genhere II unemployment is the lowest it‚Äôs ever been?? I‚Äôm sorry but are you talking about Lebanon or another country? Because the comment you‚Äôre replying to is talking about Lebanon
Comment 69.3	@R√¶genhere II Study a little economics before you start saying others are nuts and you might not continue to be as stupid as you sound.
Comment 69.4	@R√¶genhere II &lt; No they don&#39;t. The rich need people to be poor but the poor don&#39;t need the rich at all.<br />It is a studied economic FACT that billionaires have neither a positive or negative effect upon GDP and that crony capitalist billionaires have a negative effect upon GDP.<br />This is WHY the poor don&#39;t need the rich at all.<br />And crowd funding the rich for them being rich, which is effectively what is happening through taxation, is stupid.
Comment 69.5	@Mean Old Lady &lt; revolutions by the middle class are for the middle class.<br />That is why all revolutions by the middle class have failed in the way you describe.<br />However revolution is a process of change not an end goal. Oppostition to revolution is merely the economic and social system being arrested by the billionaires and being stuck to the point where there is economic dysfunction and social fracture.<br />Economic dysfunction and social fracture feed each other until both grind everyone&#39;s efforts to a complete collapse.<br />The more enlightened richies, as useless and worthless as they are to everyone else, KNOW that without enough revolution their wealth becomes worse than worthless i.e. evidence of their traitorous behaviour to their fellow citizens.<br />The rich need people to be poor but the poor don&#39;t need the rich at all.<br />It is an economic fact that billionaires contribute neither positively or negatively to GDP but crony capitalist billionaires have a negative effect upon GDP.<br />THIS is why the poor don&#39;t need the rich at all.
Comment70	When brexit reduces the UK to the level of Lebanon I doubt there will be many admitting they voted for it.
Comment71	I&#39;m proud to be an American <br /> If i said this in public, BBC would call me a racist
Comment 71.1	Jack Chevy then, yeah, you‚Äôre a racist.
Comment 71.2	@Thrill Hou blackface???
Comment 71.3	BBC wouldn&#39;t call anyone racist for being proud of the country you live in.<br /><br />Why you&#39;re proud of it might be a different matter.<br /><br />If you said you were proud of the genocide of the natives, or proud of the slavery that built America, you might get questioned.<br /><br />But only a thin-skinned Trump supporter would make such a &#39;fake news&#39; claim about the meia that is so  patently untrue.<br /><br />I&#39;ve seen Fox News,  I&#39;d rather have the BBC any day.
Comment 71.4	Jack Chevy I mean. You might be a racist. <br /><br />üò¨<br />Quick question, what did you dress up as last Halloween?
Comment 71.5	@Arfur Fuxxakes We&#39;re all the same. Anywhere you go we want the same things. Countries are like companies, some are small, and some are big, some provide us with resources, and some barely do. Most businesses are corrupt, like most nations. :-)

Comment74	We are at the end of civilization.  JESUS CHRIST IS COMING FOR HIS FLOCK PRAYERS UP FOR ALL IN PAIN AND FED UP!! JESUS CHRIST LOVES US!!
Comment 74.1	"@Public Public - Of evil people, yes.  Man-made govts &amp; ideologies don&#39;t work.  Thousands of years of civilizational rising &amp; falling have proven this.<br />There is no evolution.  We haven&#39;t evolved.  We&#39;re making the same mistakes over &amp; over again thinking it will result in something different, but it&#39;s all the same lies in the end.<br />Islam is the most genocidal ideology in human history that&#39;s killed 669+ million people over 1400 years.<br />Atheist utopianism is a big #2 with 120+ million killed in just over 100 years.<br />These are the 2 biggest competing ideologies right now that are killing everyone else, yet no matter how tyrannical they are, they haven&#39;t stomped out Christianity, it&#39;s only continued to thrive despite horrendous persecution.<br />Ultimately atheism will fall under the weight of islam.  Islam is more dedicated to the fight &amp; atheism is built on a foundation of sand where everything is subjective &amp; crumbles away to dust.<br />Islam is only so strong because it tries to usurp the Judeo-Christian foundation for itself, yet 1400 years later, islam is still the biggest &amp; most obvious fraud in human history.<br />If the anti-Christ rose from any ideology so far, it would be from islam since islam tries to mirror everything about Judeo-Christian history, figures &amp; most importantly, God - yet it continues to fall amazingly short while perverting everything it touches.<br />However, the best muslim isn&#39;t a dead one, it&#39;s an EX-muslim - which is quite a feat in itself given that there is a death penalty for apostasy.<br />Jesus was the best person that ever lived (with so much more documentation on his existence than anyone else in ancient history) so we should all be following his example, not muhammad&#39;s:<br />Sahih Bukhari (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig9JvnuGAgc&amp;t=52m17s"">52:17</a>7) - Allah&#39;s Apostle said, &quot;The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. &quot;O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.&quot;<br />Sahih Bukhari (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig9JvnuGAgc&amp;t=52m22s"">52:22</a>0) - Allah&#39;s Apostle said... &#39;I have been made victorious with terror&#39;<br />Sahih Bukhari (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig9JvnuGAgc&amp;t=52m44s"">52:44</a>) - A man came to Allah&#39;s Apostle and said, &quot;Instruct me as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward).&quot; He replied, &quot;I do not find such a deed.&quot;<br />Sahih Muslim (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig9JvnuGAgc&amp;t=1m33s"">1:33</a>) - the Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah<br />Sahih Bukhari (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig9JvnuGAgc&amp;t=8m38s"">8:38</a>7) - Allah&#39;s Apostle said, &quot;I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: &#39;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&#39;. And if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not interfere with them except legally.&quot;<br />Sahih Muslim (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig9JvnuGAgc&amp;t=1m30s"">1:30</a>) - &quot;The Messenger of Allah said: I have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allah.&quot;<br />Sahih Bukhari (52:73) - &quot;Allah&#39;s Apostle said, &#39;Know that Paradise is under the shades of swords&#39;.&quot;<br />Sahih Bukhari (11:626) - [Muhammad said:] &quot;I decided to order a man to lead the prayer and then take a flame to burn all those, who had not left their houses for the prayer, burning them alive inside their homes.&quot;<br />Sahih Muslim (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig9JvnuGAgc&amp;t=1m14s"">1:14</a>9) - &quot;Abu Dharr reported: I said: Messenger of Allah, which of the deeds is the best? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Belief in Allah and Jihad in His cause...&quot;<br />Sahih Muslim (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig9JvnuGAgc&amp;t=19m42s"">19:42</a>94) - &quot;Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war... When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah&#39;s help and fight them.&quot;<br />Sunan an-Nasa&#39;i (Sahih) &quot;Whoever dies without having fought or thought of fighting, he dies on one of the branches of hypocrisy&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Quran (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig9JvnuGAgc&amp;t=2m24s"">2:24</a>4) - &quot;Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.&quot;<br />Quran (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig9JvnuGAgc&amp;t=2m21s"">2:21</a>6) - &quot;Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it.

Comment 76.1	fake views from you as well.... double whammy!
Comment77	I also have Lebanese relatives! I&#39;m British.We should all remove racism and help each others! Currently I&#39;m in Lebanon it has been my 11th year here after I came from England but I have to admit Lebanon is a quite nice country despite the liers and those theives (politicians) and now the Lebanese people started a revolution to take their rights back from those bunch of ministers that are troubling the country which led to the revolution!

Comment 79.1	@Arfur Fuxxakes And i wish you the best in life.
Comment 79.2	@AWResistance <br /><br />You are so delusional. <br /><br />Good luck with your crutch.
Comment 79.3	@Arfur Fuxxakes I&#39;m high on life mate, come join me. <br /><br /><br /><br />Are billions of people around the world not rational? Are Christians who happen to be scientists, philosophers, professors, historians, doctors, etc.....also not rational? Christians use faith in the belief about God and the afterlife, and use reason and logic for everything else in the natural world. But what you&#39;re really trying to say is: that only you, and handful of others, are rational people. Sounds more like arrogance than rationality. <br /><br /><br /><br />Religion is about controlling the simple-minded? Of course, simple-minded people are dangerous. Religion is a guide for those incapable of thinking through their ill-thought-out ideas, and those incapable of controlling their irrational desires. Religion frees a man from slavery to his irrational desires (lust, anger, sloth, greed, envy), the natural proclivities of mankind. Mankind in the bare is a savage creature, just read ancient history or your local newspaper. You live in a successful Christian civilisation where mankind has be elivated to sainthood, but you foolishly believe this is the natural state of humanity.  <br /><br /><br /><br />The lord is not your shepherd.......because you live in a successful and comfortable Christian civilisation where you can live as a saint without acknowledging the founder. Your living at home with your parents and enjoying the benefits of the labour. Your standing on the shoulders of giants.
Comment 79.4	@AWResistance <br /><br />You&#39;re a junkie in denial. <br /><br />Whatever helps you sleep at night.<br /><br />You&#39;re belief is ludicrous to any rational person. <br /><br />It&#39;s your comfort blanket, don&#39;t expect others to fall for it.<br /><br />You claim that I&#39;m parrotting,  yet your religion is based on parrotting,  because no part of it is evidence based.<br /><br />Your only claim can be that you&#39;re parrotting superstitions from 2000 years ago.<br /><br />Most of us grew out of fairytales,  obviously you&#39;re too gullible for that.<br /><br />Religion has always been about controlling the simple-minded.<br /><br />The lord is not my shepherd for I am not a sheep.
Comment 79.5	@R√¶genhere II Not quite true. Early Christians (Justin Martyr, Saint Augustine, ect..) believed in the concept of &#39;Christians before Christ&#39;. Men like Plato and Moses being concidered to be at least two prefigurements of Christian truth, albiet imperfect. The Jews came close with the Mosaic law, the pagans came close with philosophical enquiry, and Jesus was the culmination of the two. God was &#39;worshipped&#39; by righteous men trying their best to understand, and Jesus then brought the mystery to full light. <br /><br /><br /><br />The old Gods are either demons, mere mtaphors, or they don&#39;t exist.

Comment 81.1	well actually the entire MENA region isn&#39;t going to change none of us would become better due to many factors <br />-world economy isn&#39;t so great (we aren&#39;t in the golden age anymore where countries were fixing themselves after world wars )<br /><br />-the region is highly unstable <br /><br />-outside influence and interference and not just from the west (the west are just a part of it)<br /><br />-the world is having a meltdown and a breakdown i am not even sure we would make it past 2020&#39;s without a world war if things are going the way they are <br /><br />-and last but not least israel generally and no israel is here to stay and isn&#39;t going anywhere <br /><br />so i think we should accept the truth that nothing is going to change in our countries <br />all of our countries from egypt to lebanon to algeria etc etc etc simply lost and we actually did along time ago we just never paid attention <br /><br />i am an egyptian and you want the truth ? the truth is we aren&#39;t brothers or sisters heck we don&#39;t even like each other so much <br /><br />we spent all of our lives fighting for useless cause and for the sake of our so called &#39;&#39;unity and the arab world&#39;&#39; which doesn&#39;t even exist and heck we even did it just to imitate europeans for most part and we failed and we even fought for pan arabism <br /><br />the most shallow , hollow useless ideology there is <br /><br />that it even attacked our ethnicites and our history and our heritage and our identities until we forgot and don&#39;t know who we are that we even called ourselves &#39;&#39;arabs&#39;&#39; we have been brainwashed <br /><br />it would have been better if we all were unified in just keeping the region and our interests safe instead of being united over the fact that we all speak the same language or how much we are arabized or because we had a shared history in some point in time (pan arabism)<br /><br />that&#39;s actually the secret of european unity they all respect their differences ethnically ,culturally and historically and they all had a shared history with each other and they even fought each other and occupied each other and married from each other as well<br /><br />but they wouldn&#39;t ever tell each other to name themselves after each other so they can protect their interests and unite because they respect each other&#39;s sovereignty and independence and differences <br /><br />tell an italian to say he&#39;s a french or tell a french to call himself german or tell an irish to call himself an english or a brit <br /><br />lol it would be world war 3 by tomorrow in europe<br /><br />we aren&#39;t arabs by the way none of us are<br /><br />we are all different ethnicities <br /><br />-lebanese are phonecians / canaanites the same  palestinians and syrians and maybe jordanians are canaanites <br /><br />israelis are israelites and part of the canaanites as well (there are many jewish groups in israel so came from the middleeast and not europeans  and there were palestinian jews as well before israel so technically israelis are related to the region to palestinians , lebanese ,syrians)<br /><br />-Iraq well are iraqis but was home to many ancient civilizations  including the Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian empires. they were never actually unified group or one group<br /><br />assyrians have their own ethnic identity too <br /><br />-us egyptians are coptic / egyptians <br /><br />-algerians , moroccans , libyans are berbers i think <br /><br />the actual arabs from the arabian gulf (saudi arabia , yemen, qatar, oman ,UAE) <br /><br />and you have kurds who are actually indigenous
Comment 81.2	@Dekuune I have a friend in Ashrifiye who&#39;s mom is Lebanese and her father is Algerian. Lovely people

Comment 81.4	Me too! Wow I&#39;m Lebanese and algerian
Comment82	Some folks complain vehemently about how bloated governments are around the world, yet listening to one of these protesters gives you a clue:  free this and free that, i.e., health care and education, as well as free housing, a free ride, no taxes, and any other thing in life they want.  Governments, especially in the west, have become bloated with bureaucracy because the citizens want to be taken care of from pre-Natal to post-Mortem.  When you have millions of free loaders living on the dole and more invading nations in the western world illegally, eventually governments cannot pay for all of this simply because those who actually work and fund free welfare are outnumbered.  <br /><br />As for this protest, kicking out everyone in the government will solve nothing because those who want change and get in power will do everything they can to retain power.  Power corrupts!
Comment83	for freedom, we support you from whole Europe, keep going, kill government
Comment 83.1	The barons of capitalism have more power than king democracy so maybe it would be better to reclaim government for and by the people.

They are paying me $95 per hour, and the best thing regarding it is that I am not really that tech-savvy, they just required basic knowledge of internet and elementary typing skill...The best thing about this gig is that I have more free time with my kids. I am able to commit quality time with my friends and family and look after my babies and also going on vacation together with them very routinely.

Comment89	Why Bbc and Europe don‚Äôt care about Azerbaijan? We also protest against our dictator government ,against Ilham Aliyev and his supporters, but nobody from Europe does care what happens in Azerbaijan, because our thieve government gave you money for being silent yes you do what suits your purpose... I have lots of words that ƒ± want to say, but who cares
Comment 89.1	"People in the West are oversaturated with news stories (every fart of one of our domestic politicians gets artificially inflated in significance by the media), so it&#39;s often a matter of not having the time to read up on every protest/regime out there. Once something does make the headlines (e.g. Hong Kong), every media outlet will jump on that story, because they need the clicks/readers (newspapers are still dying).<br />Why Hong Kong? Because China is looking like the next global superpower and everybody is apprehensive of a country that actively develops new technology (e.g. gait analysis) to monitor people literally everywhere. In other words, the Chinese party dictatorship seems more dangerous than any old one-man-show dictatorship (those have a tendency to fall eventually, e.g. Mubarak in Egypt, Gaddafi in Libya, etc.). Also, Europeans, specifically, are very concerned with Turkey and Russia right now, which are much closer to home and seem to be doing whatever they please.<br />There are so many other protests deserving of our attention:<br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ongoing_protests"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ongoing_protests</a><br />Also, remember this? --&gt;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Drug_War"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Drug_War</a><br />I know that doesn&#39;t excuse the self-centered way in which Europe choses which protests to focus on. Anyway, I hope this explains why we don&#39;t show our support for every cause.<br /><br /><br /><br />TL;DR: too many dictatorships to deal with them all; local media focusing on often insignificant domestic issues."
Comment 89.2	@Maya Ibrahimova I&#39;m not Armenian, but your attitude towards an entire race of people is perhaps a good indication of why the BBC don&#39;t care.

Comment91	*Lebanese Nation is an Ancient Phoenician! Why can be a Nation and Cultured Arabian now?
Comment 91.1	*The meaning of the Northern Hemisphere is the Northern part of the Equator and in the History of Early Civilization Humans came from the Ancient Mesopotamia land there! That is very different from the Northern Earth like Norway you mean just now!
Comment 91.2	@Henky Mizella  and if u meant by  Norwegian people  when u mentioned northern hemisphere  i am interested  to know about the creation of their ships ..... cz if u notice it s a stolen  technology since the exact same ship is the symbol  of the Port of Beirut.
Comment 91.3	"@Henky Mizella  if u are interested in the  Pheonician Culture,where they started and everything about our history (what&#39;s known at least)  you can  check this  youtube  channel: <br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOOsEGLOEk-Q0w12fsqGMVw"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOOsEGLOEk-Q0w12fsqGMVw</a><br /><br />you can contact the  owner of the channel he will send u all Materials needed  to learn everyhting about us ....<br />if u are a middle eastern  i assume things will be easier for u , cz most of the things haven t changed  a lot especially in speaking  and if u are lebanese  it gets even more easier for u in pronunciation and it would make u understand  our hometowns names  and  our traditions  especially the common words we use in our daily life which has no meaning  for example mshaHar...&quot;"
Comment 91.4	@aTm *I only know a few Phoenician Cultures, which at least recorded in Their History from Groups of People who carried the Earliest Civilizations of Humans and those in the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth! Whereas the Arabs proved to be only in the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth! How many Civilizations can They come out and the Funny thing is They can claim to feel older and more to bring the salvation of mankind and They must be respected by Humans forming This CIVILIZATION namely  the People of the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth?!
Comment 91.5	Exactly,can you  write or speak  Phoencian ?! <br />the Whole country was called Canaan and with few parts from syria and Isral however the Western Mountaisn were Called the Mountaisn of Lebanon (ê§ã‚Äèê§Å‚Äèê§ç‚Äè)since the creation of the universe ..<br />the bible says  in psalms 104 i assume that God created the whole universe with one word and then came down to Lebanon and Planted its Cedars with his Bare Hands ....I am not sure if the same trees still Exist this day ... but i am Very Confident there are so many trees in here  are around 4000 years old .... and the oldest one is at the entrance of Cedars city it&#39;s dying it s been eating by worms for 40 to 60 years so far  details information can be found in Cedars City or Barook, u can ask for Flyers.<br />ê§å‚Äèê§ç‚Äè ê§Ä‚Äèê§ì‚Äèê§î‚Äè ê§ã‚Äèê§Å‚Äèê§ç‚Äè ê§ï‚Äèê§á‚Äèê§â‚Äè ê§å‚Äèê§å‚Äèê§ã‚Äèê§ä‚Äèê§ï‚Äè ê§çê§ä‚Äèê§ç‚Äèê§è‚Äèê§ç‚Äè

Comment93	I&#39;m proud to be English but the BBC would call me racist and far right for saying so.
Comment 93.1	It&#39;s okay to be proud of anything. Being proud of your nationality doesn&#39;t intrinsically make you racist, but if you support fascist institutions, that would make you racist. If you do, then don&#39;t pivot back to being a victim of being called racist due to your nationality. It&#39;s dishonest.
Comment 93.2	@Bucket with a face on it <br /><br />I&#39;ve seen some of your comments,  I&#39;m not surprised at people reporting them.

Comment 95.1	Marwan Lebnani Wrong. Number one enemy of lebanon is israel whos intention is to create instability in your country, and you are foolish enough to fall for it. The drug lords in bekaa are a different story, stop trying to mix up a resistance group as some kind of a criminal organization. I guarantee you a criminal organization wont care enough to protect the borders or country from terrorists attacks in syria.
Comment 95.2	@toaster road Hezbollah is the number one enemy of Lebanon. They are controlling all the drugs and money from it from the Bakka all the way to Europe, from the millions they make out of this criminal activities they pay Lebanese politicians to be quite and to do what Hezbollah tells them to do. Iran &amp; Hezbollah  are the real master of Lebanon now and people are sick of it.

Comment 95.4	Official FBI how do u blame hezbollah? Didnt alot of brave men die fighting for lebanon through the help of hezbollah to kick israel out back in 06? They are not the ones imposing taxes and how do they create more jobs this is all out of their hands the country is flooded with immigrants who take the job for way less which is why alot of lebanese cant find work
Comment 95.5	All they want to do is steal our money its been like that for over 50 or so years
Comment96	Hahahaha nobody cares about some shitty irrelevant country called Lebanon.<br /><br />Lebanon should either be ruled by Syria or Turkey we dont need useless countries like lebanon, andorra, san marino, naru and palau or the solomon islands.

Comment 104.1	The BBC is late to the game. If this was anywhere in a rich country it would have been in the news last weekend when it started. Lebanon needs reform
Comment 104.2	Lebanon has been ablaze for quite some time now. There have been people demanding the fall of the system for over a year. It&#39;s just now that we all became united. BBC in this case helps the Lebanese by giving a platform for our voices to be heard in the international community. We want the money that our politicians stole back.
Comment105	ALL from ALL countries should be proud.  I have Lebanese relatives in my family and adore them.  We&#39;re all in this together, regardless of what the stupid &#39;conservative&#39; politicians say.
Comment 105.1	@Anthony .M I&#39;ve been making and eating hummus since one of my relatives taught it to me 40+ years ago.  Buy chickpeas and sesame seeds in 5-gallon buckets.  And, of course, my Lebanese relatives INSIST that Lebanon is the home of hummus!
Comment 105.2	Ah that&#39;s what I like to hear! I also have Lebanese relatives! My mum to be exact but I&#39;m british.We should all remove racism and help each others! Currently I&#39;m in Lebanon it has been my 11th year here after I came from England but I have to admit Lebanon is a quite nice country despite the liers and those theives (politicians) and now the Lebanese people started a revolution to take their rights back from those bunch of ministers that are troubling the country which led to the revolution!
Comment 105.3	@Samer S Let&#39;s dream of one world, where all faiths, all colors, all cultures can live in peace.  First step isn&#39;t  to build silly walls around countries, but to embrace all.  I&#39;m a Roman Catholic and follow the leadership of Pope Francis.
