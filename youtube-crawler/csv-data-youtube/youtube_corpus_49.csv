Comment3	"Does he live in WA? What time was this? There was a storm that moved through <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSPq8MVNGOA&amp;t=8m30s"">8:30</a>-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSPq8MVNGOA&amp;t=9m00s"">9:00</a> my house but then an explosion around 1:00 am. Trust me when I say it wasn‚Äôt lightning and thunder. I was outside. I left comment on Mike Morales latest video explaining. In Marfoogle‚Äôs broadcast video it sounds like thunder."
Comment4	I haven‚Äôt seen Marf in a long time..., Loooking Good Marfoogle.<br /><br />Definitely saw the light flashes. I didn‚Äôt consider lightning. Cuz, I didn‚Äôt hear.<br />I am grateful Marf that you made it back to your mic. Unharmed on the outside..., stay strong on the inside!
Comment5	After a flash of lightning, count the number of seconds till the sound of thunder. For every 5 seconds the lightning is one mile away. üòä  ML Copper ü§ó‚ù§

Comment10	BETTER GET YOUR MOMMY!!!
Comment11	It&#39;s called thunder omg
Comment 11.1	@CJ BLAZE  OK so he didn&#39;t call so I don&#39;t have time to talk on the phone but I am right hand to God trying to  Help him  Because it is very important. I would understand his hesitation but I don&#39;t like people going after livelihood and I am trying to help him but it&#39;s too late to talk on the phone he never called or you never gave him the message by like I said I will have my phone available for taxed until 9 EST 6PST so basically like 3 hours or after that I will be available again until Monday  And by then it will be too late by then anyway this is time sensitive for this is also my last text because I was just trying to help and not only did he not call it seems like you are just ignoring me well OK I tried to do the right Christian thing
Comment 11.2	@CJ BLAZE  Unless he just wants to text me then I would be available until 5PST white on the phone 3PST and if he doesn&#39;t want to that is totally fine no problem at all I don&#39;t even care I just wanted to help him out  Believe it or not and I can&#39;t say it here
Comment 11.3	@CJ BLAZE  If he can&#39;t call by then then that is fine too  I just wanted to help him  About something very specific And like I said it is genuine and that is on my parents and he  Will understand what I mean. 7743035555. But I will be unavailable after 3 PST SO HALF HOUR LEFT
Comment 11.4	@CJ BLAZE  If you are referring to me I am not a hater. IA encourage people to watch M ARF in the reason I didn&#39;t know until this morning is because  RTP and snaps who I wish a speedy recovery again despite his disgusting videos whether they I down on not over 500 people saw them and he has been saying it in about 10 different videos despite knowing the truth but now RTP showing up at people&#39;s door armed after calling in and Adam supporting him and this guy sleeps in his car so how is he getting around and it seems like Adam finally told him off last night because RTP was clearly upset with Adam and Blue Moon who may be the same person or maybe it is decks I don&#39;t know but that&#39;s what I was told but that doesn&#39;t matter what matters is this guy an ex felon going around making up lies getting my work called and then yesterday he doesn&#39;t even try to hide it anymore he now is begging people to find out exactly where I work so he can call and convinced them to fire me because in his words I am a psycho. Meanwhile all I see is a man   Falling apart publicly Making threats showing up at houses just like he told Adam he would do and still has a bunch of other houses he wants to go to and somehow like 5 different people get a website in the same day and yes they are cheap but they don&#39;t know how to make them that&#39;s to hide pot but I&#39;m getting off trackIf I could I ask a favor of you please for old times sake I need to speak to Adam ASAP in believe it or not I am actually looking out for him. I tried to text the number for the call in show and nobody got back to me I tried to tweet him and I am blocked and then I tried in email last week in over spawns so I am going to be working on a video from 6:00 p.m. EST on so that only gives me a 1/2 hour but if he could call before then meaning 3:00 p.m. his time I would be extremely appreciate of and he will be happy that he called after we talkI swear on my parents , he will  know what I mean
Comment 11.5	The Red Pill News Dispensary haters ganna hate... but they keep watching!  Hope your well...God bless! ‚ù§Ô∏èüôå
Comment12	I live in Pa and I am 50 years old. We had a storm like 2 weeks ago that was not like anyone I have ever seen or felt not normal. The thunder didn&#39;t roll it slammed everything up and down crazy
Comment13	He had his headphones on, then, his chair rolled on the floor making a noise....<br />He must be talking about something else???
Comment14	DEW. .
Comment15	It‚Äôs called lightning people. It‚Äôs not anything new. Lol.
Comment16	Wow, thank you Copper!!‚ò∫Ô∏è
Comment17	I SAW THE FLASH
Comment18	Might be nice to include another minute of his explanation! Stupid
Comment 18.1	@S. E. C-R right but people might not know that. 2 seconds longer would help
Comment 18.2	"travelnc2g It‚Äôs on the replay of his original airing starting around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSPq8MVNGOA&amp;t=1h35m45s"">1:35:45</a> into the video."
