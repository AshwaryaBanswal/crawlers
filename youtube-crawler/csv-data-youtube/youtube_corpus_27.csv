Comment1	Boris is tied by his less Eurosceptic collegues. Once Farage gets enough seats, these collegues will understand they need Farage to get Brexit done.
Comment2	BORIS  WILL  REGRET  THIS  DECISION
Comment3	Boris has dug his ditch
Comment4	BoJo has been put back in his box and has yielded to the Deepstate EU plan.  <br />It’s not our deal - it’s an EU treaty. Not what the 17.4 million voted on either.
Comment5	BoJo just lied in this interview completely.... His Deal does not make us Free, he is ticking a milestone date called &quot;leave the EU&quot; but all the deal problems have been kicked down the road for another 3 years and during that time any EU deal is adjudicated by the ECJ, how can that end up being a good deal for the UK. There a number of other EU hooks in the deal as well..  Just read people....
Comment6	England, UK how is it that AFTER years &amp; years of trying to free yourself you can&#39;t? Choose Farage to lead you to freedom from the EU so you can once AGAIN, be truly a Sovereign independent nation with the ability to trade with nations that will NOT exploit and oppress you as the EU has been doing to you.  Get truly free from the EU like you were before the EU tricked you into bed with them.  Like May, Johnson is NOT working in the best interest of the people of England and UK. Dump him.
Comment 6.1	It&#39;s just the UK, not &quot;England and UK&quot;. England is one of the four countries which makes up our nation.<br /><br />Moreover, Farage has stood for election a ridiculous number of times, and never gotten anywhere near victory. I know his supporters make a lot of noise, but the majority of this country has no appetite to back someone like him.
Comment7	Boris trusts the EU. I don&#39;t trust Boris. The Brexit Party is the real deal.
Comment8	Slightly off topic but could the bbc do a special report regarding the security surrounding the royals? <br />With all the Epstein stuff ( that you’re not covering) and previously Saville, it appears the secret service are incapable?<br />What are the chances of two royals having close friendships with paedophiles?? If I were to be in the same room as a royal I’m pretty sure they’d have unearthed anything and everything. So ... I’m just wondering .....
Comment9	Boris will save UK. Corbin will destroy it.
Comment10	I&#39;m sick of voting, it clearly doesn&#39;t work. People voted to leave the EU and didn&#39;t get it. People voted for Theresa May because she said she would deliver brexit, but again it didn&#39;t happen. People backed Boris because he would deliver brexit and again it didn&#39;t happen.
Comment11	No deal better than a bad deal.<br /> Brexit party it is !!!
Comment12	Forget this subject. The BBC - particularly Emily Maitlis - are so anti-Conservative/Brexit its disgusting.  Like with Bercow any semblance of impartiality is gone. And we are supposed to pay a license fee for this Crap?!
Comment13	Time to Go
Comment14	hung parliament,  labour snp alliance, no brexit, independent Scotland, unlimited immigration- you&#39;d better believe it. oh and Boris will lose his seat. our society is lost. we must fight to liberate our land.
Comment15	Boris BS your a lier.
Comment16	Time to double triple down On HK index
Comment17	Very very big to HK index cfds...Pay close attention
Comment18	Get rid of brexit.
Comment19	Get rid of Boris.
Comment20	Nigel is ace.
