Comment11	With Everything I have seen, it seems like the drill points allow the pressure out with way smaller earthquakes than if there were no drillpoints. Id take 100 4s than one 6 anyday.. Earthquakes have always hit those areas, but lately they have actually been smaller.. Sure it messes up their equipment way down sometimes, but at least it keeps the pressure from building brother . That being said , NO DO NOT DRILL INTO A DANG SUPER VOLCANO OR EVEN SMALLER ONES. &quot;Devils Kitchen&quot;, yeah could be a great name some day!! Smh!   Keep up the great work man!
