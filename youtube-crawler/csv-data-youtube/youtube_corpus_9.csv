Comment1	Doesn&#39;t Britain already hold the land speed record
Comment2	This is what happens when Scrapheap challenge goes too far ,you get loons lashing up crocks of shit like this .The driver needs saving from himself &amp; certifying / sectioning for his own good !
Comment3	Its a jet engine
Comment4	One Question.   Why?
Comment5	It&#39;s good to see the Anglo - South African relations come into effect to further develop our knowledge in the field of physical sciences.
Comment6	I&#39;m not trying to be a killjoy or a party pooper but what is the point of these land speed records? genuinely asking if any of this technology can be used to improve life in any way?
Comment 6.1	If you can&#39;t engage in conversation without insulting someone! I wouldn&#39;t bother commenting if I was you !
Comment 6.2	@Zen Mate Never mind then. It gains not to engage into conversation with an uncultured spoon. <br />As you were.
Comment 6.3	@Ivan Strydom Again like I said, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. This has nothing to do with high speed ground transportation, high speed landing, nor supper sonic commercial airliners. These are all different things. Its like saying F1 is improving submarine tech. It&#39;s not, just in case you&#39;re not aware.
Comment 6.4	Zen Mate these test provide data that allows for further expansion of high spend ground transportation as well as high speed Landing potential of aircraft in the near future, not that I expect you to have any knowledge of the sort of thing. So just leave this video and go watch a mind numbing reality show with celebrities or something. <br /><br />So in the future your brainless child will be on a supper sonic commercial airliner coming in for a high speed landing and he will be none the wiser as to his dim witted father refeuting the validity / necessity for the tests that enables him to do so.
Comment 6.5	@Ivan Strydom You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. I just commented on your other exact comment. How can &quot;Aero dinamics&quot; (btw, please spell check) on a salt lake be of any use to anyone? Seriously asking, doubt you know the answer but...
Comment7	It doesn’t matter what anyone calls it. If the independent verifier, the FIA, is satisfied that it is a car, then it is a car.
Comment8	The purpose of this car us to get children interested in the STEM subjects. This has already been going on for some years in schools the UK and in the attempt-location in South Africa.
Comment9	What if it crashes
Comment10	But Why?
Comment11	This is not a car mate. Put a car engine... Don&#39;t fool like Brexit!
Comment12	faster than koenigsegg and Hennessey and ssc and Bugatti and everybody else...…….
Comment13	Boring!<br />Looks nothing like a car because it’s not a car.<br />50 years ago this might have been interesting but not today. Looks as though a few bored old wealthy men were going through some sort of life crisis! Thrown enough money at something and it’ll go twice as fast as your car that’s not a car.
Comment 13.1	Pierre cim  these videos are utter bullshit
Comment 13.2	Well this is utter bullshit you&#39;ve written here my friend
Comment14	Feed the poor for God sake. Waste of money here. This is nothing to God.
Comment15	Good luck chaps. I remember keeping a keen interest in 1997 with the 763mph record, and it will be a lot more interesting to you trying for 1000mph.
Comment16	Great, super but what a shame ......... destruction of nature!!!!! Our next generations will live to undo the damage inflicted on our environment
Comment17	Jet car this year and rocket car next year.
Comment 17.1	They’re doing high speed testing this year so only need the jet engine. For the 1000mph record they will use both together to thrust bloodhound up to 1000 mph!
Comment18	Awesome..............
Comment19	I own a car that has a top speed of 180 mph (289 KPH) and you couldn&#39;t give me a million dollars to drive this car at 180 mph. I&#39;ve had it up to 120 and things started going really fast. After having a Charmin moment I let off the gas. When I was young and stupid, I would have driven the thing to the limit, but when you get older you realize how fragile life is.
Comment 19.1	True
Comment20	What is the limit on land speed records????
Comment 20.1	@Kerb_appeal amazing.
Comment 20.2	So far it’s 760mph
