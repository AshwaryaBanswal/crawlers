Comment48	The shared driveway is apparently meantly designed for them.   Now cleaning the snow is another thing to discuss.  But it is a very good video.
Comment49	I also have a sister, but I don&#39;t know if we share the same dad or not. I think she was around 10-14 years old the last time I saw her. My biological parents were getting ready to have another child when they decided to give her up for adoption. My grandma and aunts were the only one that knew of this sister, but sadly, my grandma passed away. She took the secret to the grave. I don&#39;t know what happened to my sister, but I know that she is out there. She&#39;s alive, I can feel it. I wish I would have gone with her, maybe I would&#39;ve had a happier life.
Comment50	Wow! I am very happy for you, beautiful ladies.
Comment51	Remarkable
Comment52	Can you babysit for us, I know it&#39;s last minute, but, you are my sister.<br /><br />What, you want to get paid? But you&#39;re my sister.
Comment53	Thank you for sharing such a beautiful story
Comment54	after years of searching she found her BBC next door
Comment55	I better ask my neighbor too.
Comment56	Why did she say grandma though?..those kids are her nieces..
Comment 56.1	Slip of the tongue
Comment 56.2	I consider my aunt my grandmother bc there is a 20 year difference between her and my mother; I have never met my real grandmother.
Comment57	I love the story ..
Comment58	Be kind to ur neighbor who would knw it could be ur partners that u been looking for :)
Comment59	Did just call her a neighbor, a sister, and a <b>grandma????</b>
Comment 59.1	Noticed that too....

Comment 60.1	Miami vice

Comment61	What an awesome story.
Comment62	So beautiful
Comment63	I’m so glad they’ve embraced one another, they’re an integral part of each other’s lives! Beautiful 😊
Comment64	Love it!
Comment65	I&#39;m not trying to be negative here but let envision for a sec that they had different gender, and both single and met in such circumstances. A chance of incest would be pretty high. Again we&#39;re just imagining.
Comment66	So happy for them I feel like crying but am drinking vodka at the moment so that will be inappropriate
Comment67	I mean what are the chances I feel if her child didn’t hang out with her they they may have nerve really had an interaction or if she has chosen a different house how different things would have been🤔🙃
Comment68	This is physics

Comment84	Cool story! I lived less than 2 hours from a half brother for 21 years. That entire time, I didn&#39;t know he existed! My new neighbor just moved next door last year, from CA. Come to find out, we lived in the same county as kids! She lived in Flint, &amp; I lived west, in Flushing! She attended my h.s. her senior year. I was a sophomore but we never crossed paths. She moved from MI. to CA. Now, she&#39;s my neighbor &amp; my friend! We both love working outdoors &amp; exploring! We call ourselves sisters from other mothers!

Comment100	Wow what a fantastic story !!!
Comment101	Now that&#39;s a GREAT story 😊
Comment102	I thought some kind like this only happen in a movie. Gosh...!!!!
Comment103	My father has 6 children. I am his eldest son and the second oldest in line. Growing up though, I was told I was the eldest child of us all. Until I was 15 years old, I had no idea that I actually had an older sister. When she was born, my (or OUR) father was only about 18. At the time, her mother wasn&#39;t sure if the child was my father&#39;s or another guy&#39;s. But the girl insisted that she just knew it was my father&#39;s. But, being so young and not knowing what to do, it was agreed that they would give her up for adoption. As fate would have it though, the family that ended up adopting her lived in the same town as my father.<br /><br /><br />They raised her in the same neighborhood I would grow up in as a child. Now my sister is only 2 years older than myself. I was a freshman in high school when a kid approached me telling me that my &quot;sister says hi&quot;. I thought at first that he was talking about one of my younger sisters. I thought it strange, because she and I didn&#39;t speak at this point (that&#39;s a story for another time). I asked if he was talking about my younger sister and he said &quot;No, your older sister.&quot; I said &quot;Alright. Now I know you&#39;re playing with me. I don&#39;t have an older sister.&quot;<br /><br /><br />He says &quot;Yeah you do. You just never knew about her.&quot; He tells me that she wants to properly meet me, tells me her name, all this stuff. To make a long story short, my sister and I were attending the same high school. She and I passed each other in the hall probably every day, not knowing that we were siblings. She became curious about her biological parents after learning that she was adopted and she found out about my father and her 5 other siblings and she found that she grew up basically down the street from my father&#39;s house. She and I met, and I ended up introducing her to our father and the rest of us. The rest is histroy. This all happened 10 years ago now.
Comment104	Tears.
Comment105	Smells like BS to me...
Comment106	What are the odds of that happening..lol
Comment107	That&#39;s so freaking amazing! What are the odds? Divine intervention? Now they can grow close, learn to love each other and support each other! I&#39;m so happy for them xx
Comment108	More curious to see how life goes on from this point.
Comment109	Hillary&#39;s daughter looks like Dawn.
Comment110	God is great all the time
Comment111	Perhaps it must have been their parent wish to meet someday.
Comment112	Found her long lost sister from another mother...lmfao

Comment117	The world is a small place
Comment118	I never got to find out who gets to shovel the driveway.
Comment119	Woooww......
Comment120	Actually she looks like her mom not like her sister
Comment 120.1	@Mathias Von Wulf If shes your step sister then you wouldn&#39;t as you have completely different biological parents
Comment 120.2	Well they are only half siblings, i&#39;m sure they are probably a good few years apart in age. I have a step sister who&#39;s 16 years older than I am. We really don&#39;t look much alike either.
Comment 120.3	Yeah I was thinking they don&#39;t look related at all.
Comment121	OMG!!! the part where she says &quot; welcome sis, i am glad to meet you &quot; 😭😭😭😭😭
Comment122	How Blessed are the both of you girls!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼💜💜
Comment123	i found my half sister on ebay around 2003........she purchased an item i was selling and i recognised her name........i double checked it with someone close in family first then messaged my ebay buyer saying congratulations youve found your half brother.........30 mins later we were chatting on the phone......we stayed in touch for about 6 years after that but drifted apart.........its a bit like &quot;long lost family&quot; on tv but all after youre reunited it can sometimes fall apart for various reasons.
Comment124	Talk about destiny!!
Comment125	The world must really feel small to them! 😂
Comment126	yup i call this complete bull*%#@
Comment127	The little one, Stella felt it!!! That’s why she kept visiting her aunt!
Comment 127.1	So true!! That makes the story even better ❤️
Comment128	Western culture is really becoming like shit !! Giving birth and throwing children !! Someone doesn’t know his or her father !! What the he’ll !!! I’m as being a Muslim I feel this is really disgusting.. in our faith it’s really important to take care of your children and not to fornicate ! <br /><br />We know our neighbors very well take care of each other’s..
Comment129	Is just me or is this something which would appear on one of those story channels?<br />mY nEigHbOuR iS mY lOnG lOsT sIsTeR

Comment 141.1	@Kristina Winter that&#39;s your business.
Comment 141.2	Enid Clarke I don’t see any resemblance whatsoever
Comment142	God bless them both and their families!
Comment143	What a grand story!<br />These two seem kind of standoffish with strangers. Understandable.<br />But, when they make connections, they stick.<br />I wonder how much of this is biological.<br />I wonder what the odds are if finding a sister next door.
Comment144	Wow... I always click on amazing stories
Comment145	Totally mesmerized by your story...☺️
Comment146	But the real question is who ended up cleaning the shared driveway when snow came? 😂
Comment 146.1	i love you omg
Comment 146.2	@Frank Musico Frank where in Canada are you?  I&#39;m also in Canada... we may be related and ....

Comment157	What a unique story!
Comment158	Fhew.. cool, :) Lol
Comment159	I am still annoyed by the shared driveway thing. Who the hell design such a house!?
Comment 159.1	shared drives and tall bushes in fence boundaries....it puts the best people at odds like little else can...
Comment 159.2	We shared a driveway. No big deal back in the day when people were civil.
Comment 159.3	Because they were meant to meet each other this way,God is great.
Comment 159.4	@DVF Same here, luckily my neighbor had a snowblower and did both sides, at Christmas I would by him a case of beer and he loved it..

Comment163	That was fun.
Comment164	Found my girlfriend next door ...so yeah you never know .
Comment 164.1	@Crazy things happen after 8:45 <br />I still dont understand but thanks any ways .
Comment 164.2	@Crazy things happen after 8:45 <br />No its me that doesnt understand your lenguage so i asked if youre willing to say that in English .😁
Comment 164.3	@My Name what? 😂 I don’t think I made any grammar mistakes...
Comment 164.4	@Crazy things happen after 8:45 <br />Explain better and speak English this time ...sounds interesting my translator tells me .
Comment 164.5	@My Name there’s actually something in psychology called the “proximity” factor. You are more likely to have a romantic relationship with someone based on close proximity.
Comment165	Love this. Makes my heart smile.
Comment166	my new neighbors probably think Im crazy xD xD im just really awkward around new ppl OK! hahha
Comment167	Great story. Such a small world.
Comment168	They look nothing alike like my two daughters. My kids share both mom and dad and still look nothing alike.
Comment 168.1	Ya, why is that.  I expect siblings to look alike, but some don&#39;t share any similarities...
Comment 168.2	True but that makes it even more interesting that  their voices are identical!
Comment169	I find this hard to believe.
Comment170	God bless you both.
Comment171	Cool !!
Comment172	We’re family share the big roll 😂
Comment173	I was like, &quot;How are they gonna do an awesome story, like this sounds like it&#39;s gonna be, in 5 minutes?&quot; Well done. Amazing story. I still would like to see a full documentary about this, though, lol 🤗💐💝🦋
Comment 173.1	"They need a DNA test proof for us nonbelievers.your a fool if you buy into every kind <a href=""http://story.tv/"">story.tv</a> shows are getting desperate.."
Comment174	Dawn johnson is such a common name. You still could be mistaken.  You need to keep.searching. you look nothing alike.
Comment 174.1	They confirmed that they have the same father, and half-siblings don&#39;t always look alike.
Comment175	Now that was a God Thing!!
Comment176	God has amazing ways
Comment177	❤❤❤
Comment178	Omg. Is this for real??? How can this be. I mean what are the odds. Same city maybe. Even same neighbor. But like next door with a shared driveway. No wayyyyyy. Omg. <br />And oh why isn&#39;t anyone as shocked as me. <br />Maybe there are forces within us drawing people towards each other when there is a special relationship. Wow.
Comment179	They sound alike.
Comment180	This’s God is work! Not a coincidence
Comment181	They were meant to meet 😂
Comment182	This looks like a Vox production. Their style has taken over.
Comment 182.1	I really like the vox style.
Comment183	HOLD IN 2 EACH OTHER!😁
Comment184	Some people are meant to be in our lives. I was introduced to a guy by a mutual friend at a roller skating rink in 1982 and we talked for several minutes about the military, as he was in the Navy and I was going to join in just a few months. I never expected to see him again and so I forgot about him. A year later, my Navy ship caught on fire and I was teamed up with a complete stranger to look for a special water to put out the fire. Since the fire was major, I ended up hanging out with this guy for about 6 hours. After four hours, we were comfortable enough to start asking each other some personal questions, like where are you from? After only a few questions and answers, I soon realized he was the guy I&#39;d met at the roller skating rink a year earlier. We quickly became best friends and are still best friends today.
Comment 184.1	amazing
Comment 184.2	@KELLI2L2 we called it light water. It was in 5 gallon blue bucket/containers and used to put out electrical fires.
Comment 184.3	SPECIAL water 💦 to put out the fire ❓❕
Comment 184.4	@Edward Traxler Yes. I ran into an old friend from Seattle in NYC and only chatted with him for a minute before we went our separate ways, as he was with friends. A few hours later, far from where we&#39;d met earlier I ran into him again at a Starbucks. This time he was alone so I sat with him and we caught up. It was a very strange thing to have run into him in NYC the first time. The second time was utterly ridiculous. 😂
Comment 184.5	I was looking around the APOD at Karshi-Khanabad Air Base in Karshi, Uzbekistan and started to ask a young SGT about the Louisiana posters on the wall. He replied that his unit was an Army Reserve unit out of Baton Rouge, LA. I looked at him and replied that I was also from an Army Reserve unit out of Baton Rouge but didn&#39;t know him. We quickly talked .. he was from the transportation unit at the air port while I was with the MMC downtown. Now .. we were &quot;home boys&quot; and started the &quot;do you know ...&quot; .. and at one point he said that he worked at a specific Radio Shack. I looked at him and went .. &quot;You tried to sell me a VCR!!&quot; .. small world sometimes.
Comment185	Amazing story
Comment186	Loving it 💞💞💞💞

Comment 211.2	People with common sense..they should have thrown in a DNA test so people like myself would believe. TV shows are getting  desperate for shows.your a fool if you just believe every kind story
Comment 211.3	Probably because they are unhappy with their life and wish they had someone. <br />Sad to say I see a lot of sad faces in the sad world.<br />I&#39;m one of the sad faces but I not a thumbs down .<br /> I&#39;ve lost so many family members in the pass few years my life has changed so much I couldn&#39;t tell you but I&#39;m being strong and move on.

Comment249	"In western societies people often overlook their neighbors and love to avoid them. They do not bother to know who is residing at their next door. Years pass by yet the two families recognize each other as strangers. Sadly, the same culture is gaining popularity into other societies as well. <br /><br />Islam on the other hand entertains respect and recognition of neighbors. It gives them their duly rights that would make the neighborhood as one family. The ambassador of Islam, Prophet Muhammad (peace, blessings and mercy upon him) talked much about the rights of neighbors, that if they are observed we could find significant differences in our lives and relations. Few of the rights addressed by the Prophet of God are listed below:<br /><br />1. Do not block his air, light by raising your building high without his permission.<br />2. You must visit (and take care of) him when he is ill<br />3. Do not harass him<br />4. If he asks you for help, you should provide help for him.<br />5. If you buy fruits send some as a gift to him, otherwise bring it to your house secretly and do not allow your children to take it out to vex his children with it. <br />6. If he dies you should participate in his funeral procession. <br /><br />The Prophet also said in regards to neighbors, <i>&quot;He is not a true Believer who eats his fill while his neighbor is hungry&quot;.</i> At another place, The Prophet (peace and mercy be upon him) emphasized on saying the statement three times, <b>“By Allah, he does not have faith!”</b> It was said, “Who is it, O Messenger of Allah?” The Prophet said, <b>“He whose neighbor is not safe from his harm.”</b><br /><br />To sum up, neighbors have so much rights that the Prophet once said, <i>“Angel Jibril advised me continuously to take care of the neighbor till I thought that Allah is to make him an inheritor.”</i><br /><br />Peace."

Comment260	Just wondering if the are other people like me who do not give a flying fuck about stories like this or the people in them. To me, human interest stories are total human disinterest stories. How much of a minority am I in?

Comment262	That&#39;s amazing must be fate! My mum had a baby girl adopted 3 years before she married my Dad and had me and I&#39;ve always wondered if I would meet her one day!
Comment 262.1	You need to do something if you want to find her. Chances are she won&#39;t move in next door. Uh...wait a sec...lol.
Comment 262.2	One of those DNA test, if she is not there she could have a family member, and that would be a way to her.
Comment263	Biggest fake news channel i

Comment 285.1	Indeed, we Africans relate to each other in our communities
Comment 285.2	Iceborn wow!
Comment 285.3	I was born and grew up in a little town in Sweden. Everybody knew each other. Now I live in Stockholm, that is a different story. I don&#39;t even know all who live in the same apartment house as me. Just those who live on the same floor and under and above. But one day I walked in at my new working place and met my long lost cousin. That felt amazing too.
Comment 285.4	Same in India

Comment298	The law of attraction in action.
Comment 298.1	bo ptah It was purely coincidence
Comment 298.2	@bo ptah that was very beautiful. <br />Also it&#39;s exactly what I think about it all. What I came to think some years ago, now. Energy is ubiquitous, it can&#39;t be created or destroyed, energy makes up everything. <br />I could never word it as beautifully as you did. <br /><br /><br />It&#39;s kinda like what goes up must come down, except energy is everywhere, in everything. <br /><br />I think you&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve read something so exact to my theory. I know you aren&#39;t the only one out there, you just happen to be the first one I&#39;ve come across in a way where it&#39;s brought up I guess. Very interesting, actually.
Comment 298.3	@Daffodil Everything is energy.  there is nothing but energy..  And energy has clearly defined laws.,  the &quot; law of attraction &quot; is just electro magnetism.  humans literally create their own reality with their electrical ,mental/emotional field.  There is no God up in the clouds planning everything.  the Energy we know as God exists within everyone .  Everything is God.  but mankind has the capacity to &#39;know&#39; this..  you might not know it.  thats fine.  but i do.  I have experienced God many times..  It is completely indescribable.,  but it means you know what the Buddha, Christ , Krishna, St Germain, Sai Baba,  and many others know.  I hope one day you will know it also..  Once you have got over the anger from reading this post.
Comment 298.4	@Daffodil God created the law of attraction..  It&#39;s not complicated.
Comment299	Great story with a happy ending. What are the odds of that happening. You girls really oughta play the Lottery together. Am thoroughly delighted for the both of you.

Comment 304.3	@Tan James Nope I love fortune cookies( to eat &amp; read the msg) but not once have they predicted the truth, im still broke &amp; single &amp; my health is not good &amp; the only travel I have done is on the bus to the supermarket
Comment 304.4	david white <br />That’s cute. Did the predictions come true?<br />Ironically fortune cookies are seldom found in the South East Asia countries nowadays. <br />You will not find it in restaurant here in Singapore. Welcome to Singapore.
