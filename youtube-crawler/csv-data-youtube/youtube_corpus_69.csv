Comment1	Famous saying Copper. You missed a bit, lol.
Comment2	Even before I ever heard of Dutchsinse, I had heard somewhere that the drill points across the nation were where there were earthquakes happening.  My niece lives in OKC and at that point 3-4 years ago there were earthquakes, and my sister in law from Ohio were talking about the earthquakes and I said to her I hear it is because of the oil drilling. So even before I ever heard of the Dutch I was spreading the word of what he knows! Yay! Because of how totally useless and corrupt the USGS is I take great pleasure in discounting the USGS to as many people I can and talking up Dutchsince. USGS just get off your high horse and report the scientific truth. You will sleep better and be much happier!  In the meantime everything you say is suspect!
