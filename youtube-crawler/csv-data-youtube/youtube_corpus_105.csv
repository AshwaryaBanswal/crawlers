Comment6	There is such a shortage of organs in the world that children and young adults are taken and harvested for organs everyday for the super rich to live. How about a video on that?
Comment7	It&#39;s not even a question to me that I want as much of me used as possible! Should I leave it to the worms and fire to be destroyed when I can save lives or make lives better? I believe that it should be the norm to use organs unless people actively opt out.
Comment8	ALLOW COMMENTS ON ALL YOUR VIDEOS OR NONE BBC. YOUR CENSORSHIP DOES NOT GO UNNOTICED.
Comment9	The idea that my death may bring someone else life brings me great comfort.<br />Other people may have thier reasons for not wanting to save another&#39;s life, I don&#39;t personally understand them, but that&#39;s my reason.

Comment 11.1	@Spangle Man show the evidence about what you &#39;hear&#39;!
Comment 11.2	"<a href=""https://www.codac.org.cn/"">https://www.codac.org.cn</a>  This is official website of China Organ Donation Administrative Center, it&#39;s managed by Red Cross Society of China. You could get excat number  of donations and successful cases there. The website is in Chinese language only, but Chrome can translate it."
Comment 11.3	Yeah for sure I hear China loves peoples rights &amp; democracy also! China is guilty of systematic organ harvesting of prisoners etc, read into &#39;Falun Gong&#39;
Comment12	If you want to donate your body to a college or university they want you organs intact
Comment13	BEST OF DEEDS ,IS BEING PURE IN ATTITUDE TOWARD MATTERS <br />,NOT THESE THINGS
Comment14	BEING  REALLY PURE IN ATTITUDE AND INTENTION IS A DEEP THING  ,NO NEED TO PUT UP  GOODS IN EXCESS OVER THE SURFACE ,BRITS MAY CALL U ,SUCKER <br />CONSUME GOODS ,<br />DEEP THING ,NOT A BRITISH THING

Comment16	Practice Falungong.
Comment17	Many Brexiters also have traumatic brain injury
Comment 17.1	Mr Pickles <br />I feel to tell people when they are acting not smart
Comment 17.2	0IIIIII <br /><br />Mind your business then, not your choice
Comment 17.3	Mr Pickles Iâ€™m an American but i can tell you Brexit is a<br />Bad idea
Comment 17.4	0IIIIII <br /><br />....... Due to having to listen to the crazed remoaner snowflake soys running round with blue hair and bad teeth!
Comment18	People shouldn&#39;t have a choice whether they donate or not. Who cares what happens to your body when you&#39;re dead, you don&#39;t need the organs anymore and they could save someone who does. Anyone who opts out is selfish af.
Comment 18.1	@Mr Pickles you&#39;re alive when you have sex... organs are only taken if BRAIN death is confirmed. So technically you&#39;re alive but will never wake up.
Comment 18.2	normal person <br /><br />No, people should always choose what they do with their body, itâ€™s a God given right......... when organs are taken they take them whilst your still technically alive, and when they take them your body is destroyed, and who can say whether your organs end up in a lab or a body...... Tell me, does your partner get a choice when you ask for sex, or do you just take it??
Comment19	Do what you like with me. I won&#39;t know.
Comment 19.1	@Paul Taylor organ donation is not some conspiracy, it&#39;s giving part of your body for someone else to live. We&#39;ll all die, we are tiny things in this world, tiny in this universe. When were gone, our family will forget us as &#39;great great uncle bob&#39; and we will fade away into time. Don&#39;t be so stuck up and think your so important that you won&#39;t let no one touch your DEAD body.
Comment 19.2	"Watch this...<br />DON&#39;T EVER BE AN ORGAN DONOR..<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/EZVo5O0W7VE"">https://youtu.be/EZVo5O0W7VE</a>"
Comment 19.3	Don&#39;t be too sure.
Comment20	I won&#39;t donate, because the recipient of my organs could be a right scumbag... You know, even convicted pedophiles are just as entitled to organ transplants as decent people are.
Comment21	Never be an organ donor! They will kill you or your loved for your organs. Organ donors are intentionally left to die or are killed instead of a natural death JUST for your organs!!!
Comment22	Good for them &lt;&lt;&lt; FREE ASSANGE
Comment23	It takes a great amount of bravery to donate your organs after death whether its you or your loved ones  who decide.
Comment 23.1	"@maszlagma<br />Err... No<br />Watch this..<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/EZVo5O0W7VE"">https://youtu.be/EZVo5O0W7VE</a>"
Comment 23.2	I don&#39;t know if it should be considered bravery, you don&#39;t need it anymore, you don&#39;t feel it being taken out and you can save lives with it, I believe it should be the bare minimum anyone can do. Now if you provide a kidney, bone marrow or part of your liver while you are still alive, that is bravery.
Comment24	National Death Service.<br />Just murdered my ma-in-laws best friend.<br />She had caught pneumonia via the pneumonia jab and was only talking on the phone from hospital 2 days ago, then her sister was told she was dying.<br />She and her husband were told to go home and we&#39;ll phone you if anything changes.<br />Within one hour she was dead.<br />They could and <b>SHOULD</b> have stayed, because that is when they overdose them on morphine to free up the bed ASAP.<br />The NHS are <b>MURDERERS</b> and the people who work in it should be ashamed to call themselves &#39;caring&#39;.<br />I removed my name from the organ transplant list a year ago to make sure this lot never take them.
Comment 24.1	That was a really interesting lie.
Comment 24.2	First of all I wanted to write the comment just to say it is impossible to get actual pneumonia from the vaccine but then read the rest of your comment and now I believe you are either a troll or have mental issues. Either way I hope you get better/change your attitude.
Comment 24.3	@Tikho yeah ikr
Comment 24.4	You really are a psycho huh
Comment25	Want the organ?  Pay for them.
Comment26	"I believe consent is assumed in the UK unless you go out of your way to opt out. The NHS admit they kill thousands of people each year. Do you really think they would let you live and take your valuable organs with you if you were in a bad way?<br /><a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2161869/Top-doctors-chilling-claim-The-NHS-kills-130-000-elderly-patients-year.html"">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2161869/Top-doctors-chilling-claim-The-NHS-kills-130-000-elderly-patients-year.html</a>"
Comment 26.1	@Mr Pickles That&#39;s fair, you don&#39;t gotta do it
Comment 26.2	I opted out, the government doesnâ€™t own my body.........
Comment 26.3	Imagine linking the daily mail as a source lmao
Comment27	I bet no one would accept my organs!

Comment28	GIVE ME BACK&#39;S ME GOLD ðŸŒˆðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°
Comment29	RIP
Comment 29.1	Did you watch any of the video? They are actors.
Comment30	free kashmir go back indiA
Comment31	Sometimes I wish others could read my mind because these words are hard to say
Comment32	The doctors and nurses are real....
Comment 32.1	Thank god for that
Comment 32.2	Well I thought they were fake aswell untill they cleared that up for me!
Comment33	Organ donation shouldn&#39;t be a issue after a person&#39;s death seriously .
Comment 33.1	"@Kellie A<br />WHO DECIDES YOU&#39;RE DEAD kellie?<br />Watch this<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/EZVo5O0W7VE"">https://youtu.be/EZVo5O0W7VE</a>"
Comment 33.2	We can opt out of our own organ donation. Once the donor is dead, the family should have no say. It just wastes time and resources going to save another life. I have told my family that if my organs CAN be donated, do it! I&#39;m dead. I&#39;m never going to use those organs again. Save someone else.
Comment 33.3	@Felippe shouldn&#39;t have a choice.
Comment 33.4	Should be opt-out really.
Comment34	Wont doctors stop trying to save ppl&#39;s lives if they can save even more w the harvested organs????
Comment 34.1	Stupid
Comment 34.2	Stupid
Comment 34.3	Stupid
Comment35	So so sad but if the death of one can at least help.pthers then bless God an his way
Comment 35.1	Previous month I managed to withdraw my first five figure check ever!!! I&#39;ve been working for this provider on the net for 2 yrs now and I never been happier... They are paying me $95 per hour, and the most desirable thing regarding this is the fact that I am not really that tech-savvy, they just asked for basic knowledge of internet and key typing skill...The best thing about this is that I have more time for my loved ones. I am able to devote quality time with my family and friends and look after my babies and also going on holiday vacation together with them very frequently. Don&#39;t let pass this opportunity and try to react fast. Let me show you what I do... <b>acttoday48Â­.Â­cÂ­oÂ­m</b>
