Comment2	it would be so nice that the migrants who are in europe (mainly in france, england, germany and sweden) were as respectful and coexistent as the ones who came to brazil.<br /><br /><br />funny thing that nobody questioned why neighbor countries like iran, saudi arabia and turkey didn&#39;t take any of them but europe took millions of them without second thoughts LMAO.<br /><br /><br />people are stupider than they realize
Comment3	Brazil... Brazil... Land of Confederate soldiers, Nazi fugitives and now Arab terrorists... Crazy country.

Comment9	Typical BBC shit.<br />Even the annoying background music.
Comment10	Never been in nothing, never auditioned for a thing.  I was just going to do music with the people close in my life, but they all just___.  I spent my young adult life having to tell people bullshit because I was always in the process of begoning  something.  Anything bigger than that, anything alien, it would have to have been a big effort, and I would have done it.  (If you must know).  Instead, I was dognapped by my owners.
Comment11	Hooray to Attila!‚ô•<br /><br />Hooray to Korea!!!‚ô•<br /><br />Destroy Roma.<br /><br />Destroy America.
Comment 11.1	My Believe look man, honestly I have no clue of what you‚Äôre saying. It makes zero sense your loose pattern of thought.
Comment 11.2	Orlando Morgado Obama was also a loyal dog in South Korea. A prostitute named Hillary is also a Korean man&#39;s favorite female dog.<br /><br />Obama, I think he&#39;s just a cockroach, but he&#39;s a very useful slave.<br /><br />I hope that America will remain loyal to Korea in the future.<br /><br />Rome eventually falls apart. The U.S. is the same.
Comment 11.3	My Believe no, never thought you as a friend. More like an clown.
Comment 11.4	Orlando Morgado oh... I&#39;m sorry if I felt bad. Did you really think of me as a friend?
Comment 11.5	My Believe you‚Äôre telling me to go away from my own country? What a outstanding stupidity!<br /><br />The video tells about this family finding a new home in my country and you post a incredible obnoxious and full of hate comment. <br />You should be ashamed of this kind of behaviour

Comment46	want to be millionaire. this madness is at the root of most economic ills and it will become the downfall of all humanity. But no one can blame him, he came from a deadly society of one kind,  he will help to create a deadly society of another kind.  In the end , what will stop this madness is an ecological disaster of some kind that will gradually terminate the life on earth.  Men&#39;s life on earth is speeding up the progress towards that destination.  Towards the end it will be inferno the strongest and the richest will have means to survive to the end but their end is also programmed and nothing can stop it. <br />I want to be a millionaire well done you will have many women who will attach themselves to you like a slug and she will give you couple of children (not more because as people get rich and comfortable they get more greedy and selfish and lazy) you have your tow children to carry on the madness.  This is why the whole idea of monogamy and the idea of so called family  unit must be revised. The World needs villages, small communs and rural life.  The Cities are killing humanity!

Besides if europeans can live in democracy and piece everybody can :) (what&#39;s your solution for christian and buddhist corrupt dictatorships bud?) And of course they&#39;re running away op, it&#39;s mini ww2 over there -_- It&#39;ll bounce back when the war ends like every country does after it&#39;s wars.

Comment 64.2	@Rubber Dub...Who said this 2 syrian rufugees are part of a &#39;&#39;diversity proganda&#39;&#39; ?....Brazil has Always been diverse in its culture, history and people. That is not case here. Also diversity in Europe has different context and lexicon than to a country like Brazil. &#39;&#39;diversity in Uk is often assiocated with failed intergration of muslim communities from Asia, and the so called Middle east. Due to a large % not wanting to conform to a liberal-western culture as the nature of islam is very orthdox and conservative

Comment 95.2	@Anonymous Coward Failed? He got 250 thousand dollars. The TV show he was in is a morning show, &quot;celebrity chef&quot; (in the description) is very hiperbolic. He only appeared once in the TV
Comment 95.3	These people failed over and over again. The one male only hit the mini-lottery by being put on a TV show.
Comment96	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca_-FWHKkBg&amp;t=0m28s"">0:28</a> It&#39;s S√£o Paulo, BBC, not Paolo."
Comment97	Stick a video up of the racist Doreen Laurence comments on the London fire brigade...and before people start with the her son was murdered by racists....she was like this way before Stephen was killed. Take it from someone local, too much you lot don&#39;t know about that family probably for the best.
Comment98	But far right and xenophobic still hate u ...in Brazil they are not majority.. But in the other one (north of Brazil, near Mexico) they rule now..
Comment 98.1	@Thomas vanDyke South of Brazil is mostly white. Cases of racism are viewed as racial injury by the commom legal view. Most of the victims are minorities primarily blacks and immigrants (Venezuelans, Peruvians, Syrians, Hatians...).
Comment 98.2	@Petit oh woow didnt know this‚Ä¶..what do you mean by racial injury in the south of brazil. I mean i know majority of south are of  recent European migration of Germany, Italy, Poland etc. But i also know there are groups of Japanese, Black Brazilians, Mixedrace Brazilians etc
Comment 98.3	"@Thomas vanDyke You had cases of Syrians, Haitians, Venezuelans, and even northeasterners (people from the northeastern region have a history of prejudice. It also falls under the same racism and racial injury laws). According to the Brazilian Public Safety Yearbook, the South Region has the most cases of racial injury. All southern states have rates above the national average.<br />Source: <a href=""http://www.forumseguranca.org.br/publicacoes/13-anuario-brasileiro-de-seguranca-publica/"">http://www.forumseguranca.org.br/publicacoes/13-anuario-brasileiro-de-seguranca-publica/</a>"
Comment 98.4	@Petit xenophobic in the south ?....against who
Comment 98.5	We have more xenophobic people in the south region of Brazil. Still happens way less than in most countries.

Comment101	Capitalism is awesome
Comment 101.1	Cousin Jeff hello my fag
Comment 101.2	@È™ÑÂÇ≤ÁöÑÂÖ±‰∫ßÂÖöÂëò Hahaha what? Why does being capitalist mean you want to get involved in foreign wars? Capitalism is a economic system, not instructions on foreign policy. You have no understanding of politics.<br />(And this is coming from a guy who critiques capitalism quite a lot).
Comment 101.3	Then why are you so mediocre?
Comment 101.4	<b>Capitalism is the main reason of these people are homeless refugees</b> <br /><br /><b>Thanks to Capitalist UK, US, France and NATO for funding the proxy wars in the middle east</b>
Comment102	Bolsonaro needs to fuck these two off
Comment103	They will be paying the Brazilian gangs for the safety of their businessüòù
Comment 103.1	In Brazil, the police is one of the gang,they get paid too but the rich pay them more so they leave the crimes in the otherside.<br /><br />Many night rape, house invasion are made by police in civilian. They stalk and knows their victims well and it&#39;s often a very young women from the favela, With brothers in prison and dead parents.<br /><br />They also robe Banks, control petty criminals and send them to do pick pockets. Finally everyone blame crime without knowing Who Is truly behind it.<br /><br />It&#39;s like the drug business between Mexico and the USA, it&#39;s all controlled by the CIA,an agency created to protect Americans
Comment 103.2	S√£o Paulo is one of the safest cities.
Comment104	Respect  syrian people.
Comment 104.1	Why ?
Comment 104.2	united africa ja , like the last respect you caused in Syria causing war
Comment105	he is planing to go back? thats good i guess
Comment106	Become a millionaire and you too can exploit the poor.
Comment 106.1	"<a href=""https://youtu.be/NxD1pOWAz_w"">https://youtu.be/NxD1pOWAz_w</a>"
Comment 106.2	@Anonymous Coward My only blame for Syria is that they denied the existence of Israel for so long, after attaching Israel on Yomkippur , thus absorbing a defeat.<br /><br />Things would have been so much better if they recognized Israel early,get back their side of the Golan before religious extremists taken power in Israel two decades later.<br /><br />Moshe Dayan,Itzhak Rabin were very reasonable intellectuals and their religious side was sleeping at home with their family.<br /><br />Now things became horrible when Netenyahu took power and only Syria is begging for peace. Arabs should understand that loosing wars have consequences, Wich is lost of lands, starvations, rape, massacres.<br /><br />Russia and America are made of conquest,same for many empires. It&#39;s your fault, not the Jews fault, they were just more modern and smarter.<br /><br />This said I don&#39;t agree that Syria people destroyed their country,it was destroyed by foreign agents. Its difficult to pinpoint who sent ISIS to destroy Syria but they are definitely fake, it&#39;s fake jihadism .<br /><br />Now some said that a good chunk of isis is made of mossad agents and the rest are brainwashed idiots recruited online with females who serve as war hore.<br /><br />I don&#39;t agree with that but many points their fingers at Israel.
Comment 106.3	Syrians ruined their own country (with some help from foreign jihadis.) Maybe they can ruin Brazil, too?
Comment 106.4	No point in having money if you do not use it for evil.
Comment 106.5	@R√¶genhere II I agree. Brazil is not Australia or Europe but at least they can work without bombs falling on their heads, that&#39;s all they need to succeed.<br /><br />Crime is another obstacle but as Muslim often donate to the poor, they are making friends in the area. <br />I hope they won&#39;t get robbed or killed,as Brazilian police is so corrupted and pro Bolsonaro, they might set them up.
Comment107	And they criticize Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro is transparent unlike jokers like Obama who masquerades as defender of human rights.
Comment 107.1	@Patrick He doesn&#39;t have that political ability to do that or that power (at least not yet).
Comment 107.2	Bolsonaro will make sure none like you are coming to Brazil.
Comment 107.3	I agree that Obama is a warmonger president.<br />But you do realize Bolsonaro is against migration, right? He is also against Muslims and Arabs.
Comment 107.4	Mohammad Mohaimin Kabir Bull shit you don‚Äôt know no shit about Bolsonaro or Brazilian governament!<br />It‚Äôs from Lula‚Äôs and Dilma rules in them government opened the visa for refugees.
Comment108	You cannot be<br />Syrious as john mc enroe used to say
Comment109	The way to a mans heart is through his stomach.anyone with good food making skills will become a millionaire
Comment 109.1	In your dreams
Comment 109.2	i have good cooking skills but you need money to make money ,its not easy either to get into a business that has more to do than just being able to cook
Comment110	But  a Muslim nation won&#39;t accept Christians like this!!
Comment 110.1	Imma add Jordan to the list and Palestine, the two main armenian churches are literally located in lebanon... plus, muslims face 52% of all hate crimes in Germany and get discriminated against constantly, not to mention entire political parties base their entire existence on hating them (and get support from very kind christians) so it&#39;s not all sunshine and rainbows you weird weird man -_-
Comment 110.2	Indonesia and Malaysia plenty of Christians living there
Comment 110.3	We accept Christians but not homo/Bisexuals, and the Capitalist Dracula<br /><br />We&#39;ve street of Christian in Islamabad Pakistan
Comment 110.4	<b>Socialist Assad protects Christians from the US/NATO backed IsIamist rebels</b>
Comment111	Great spirit and best wishes to both of you!
Comment112	Great spirit, i am sure the dreams they already left are even greater.
Comment113	How do you go from Syria to Brazil? Like who is funding this people
Comment 113.1	@Petit - You&#39;d better band together &amp; take them out now before they wage jihad on you in 10-20 years&#39; time.
Comment 113.2	You go by plane and you buy a ticket.
Comment 113.3	Most of the immigrants had money or they got help from someone who did. The immigrants helps themselves, the Brazilian Government doesn&#39;t really help them (because we can&#39;t, and the brazilian economy is recovering from a recession). The welfare system is not very strong as exists in Europe.
Comment 113.4	There&#39;s a fairly large Syrian community in Brazil. There was a large wave migration of Syrians and Lebanese to Brazil in the 1950s.
Comment 113.5	Ngm Mngw yeah , bit odd for them in Latin America
Comment114	Brazil is always better than having Syrian dudes coming to Europe
Comment115	Thank you Brasil for giving them a new home.
Comment 115.1	Im from Brasilüáßüá∑

Comment116	Brazil is more violent than Syria,
Comment 116.1	EFIL WV how can you compare it ? In Syria there‚Äôs WAR, in Brazil there isn‚Äôt.
Comment 116.2	@Mean Old Lady bud, i have read some holybook (including quran) but i have never found (NOT A SINGLE ONE) An instruction to do violence.<br />You may be missing a characteristics of holy book here, i even doubt you read a bible.
Comment 116.3	Mean Old Lady 60K people get murdered in Brazil annually. That‚Äôs more than die in Syria.
Comment 116.4	"No, it isn&#39;t.

Comment 116.5	"The issue is that inequality is high. Therefore, violence does not prevail everywhere, it depends on where you go to just like in other countries. You can have a decent life out there. It&#39;s a huge and lovely country which received many immigrants from Germany, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Israel, Portugal, Africa, among others throughout its history. For instance, read this text about the Japanese community in Brazil: <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Brazilians"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Brazilians</a>"
Comment117	no idolatry in Brazil.
Comment118	Be careful out there, Brazil is one of the most violent countries on the planet, it&#39;s homicides rates are always over the roof.
Comment 118.1	@F-22 Raptor I will explain to you that hardly a non-Brazilian will understand this, I believe that more than 80% of violence in northern Brazil has caused drug trafficking, criminal factions created in southeastern prisons dominate the dispute for drug trafficking in the north and in Brazil all. We can say that this war is new in northern Brazil, but the southeast specifically S√£o Paulo was once as violent as in the north the reality is that one of these factions dominates the entire state of S√£o Paulo so crime is low there is no war that happens in the north. And fuck all your skin color theory.
Comment 118.2	@Thomas vanDyke So you are saying when a white emigrates, it is white nationalist/white supremacist bullshit. Question for you - what is it when a black emigrates ? is that black nationalist  / black supremacist bullshit ?<br /><br /><br />I think this is the last we will hear from little Tommy.
Comment 118.3	F-22 Raptor prime example how great and multicultural and beneficial it is for all sides espectheir food for all those foodies out there
Comment 118.4	@F-22 Raptor Your evidence for this is? Or is it just anecdotal evidence as always, you dimwit.
Comment 118.5	@Thomas vanDyke it&#39;s actually true, in southern Brazil violence is less because most of the white people resides in southern part of Brazil while in North Brazil violence is high because of Latinos and blacks.
