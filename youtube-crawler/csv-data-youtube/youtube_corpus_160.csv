Comment1	Seems like a showoff to shut up western media so that they can abuse women happily ever after
Comment2	So sad that this is even real in this day and age...a woman had to set herself on fire, just for this crumb.
Comment3	MEN AND WOMEN EQUALITY<br />🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷
Comment4	Western peoples called this is freedom .... hahaahha
Comment5	Innocent children killing in kashmir with pellets gun and other weapons
Comment6	Wow what a shite country iran is
Comment7	Now I understand why the USA is starting on Iran again. Shame on then for giving women some rights. The last time they attempted democracy the USA removed Mohammed Mosadeghe
Comment8	I think people need to understand that although Iran was a very modernized and western country before the revolution, that now a lot of those things have been reversed and we have no choice but to accept it and start to build Iran from scratch. From the bottom up. Yes it is sad that the modern country Iran once was is no longer there. (Modern = human rights and no strict sharia law) But we simply cannot dwell on the past and say “get these mullahs out of Iran and bring the shah back!” People legitimately think this will happen, but it’s just so unrealistic. Our best bet to make Iran “great again” lol, is to patiently make progress like this step by step and after a while this Islamic regime will collapse under its own weight, just like the Soviet Union.
Comment 8.1	@Tasin Al-Hassan What&#39;s false azizam
Comment 8.2	That&#39;s false.
Comment9	Hate hate hate
Comment10	B I G deal🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
Comment11	And their team won 14-0.<br />It&#39;s likely they will be disappointed when they go to their second match...
Comment12	T-this is depressing.<br /><br />It is fantastic that after all this time, they are finally allowed into stadiums.<br />But the fact that they weren&#39;t to begin with, someone had to set themselves on fire and that we have to celebrate this, is depressing.
Comment 12.1	@Qwerp This had nothing to do with the Blue girl. Stop mentioning her lmao. That girl was mentally ill and she randomly entered the stadium. Her own father admitted to this.
Comment 12.2	@Qwerp If women were allowed in the stadiums from the beginning there wouldn&#39;t be this much of hooligans in Iranian fans and their vulgar language, women&#39;s presence could have a positive effect. I am a conservative however telling this. Funny thing is if these women are so much after equality they should go to their women&#39;s Football instead which 99% of them won&#39;t go there to support Iranian female footballers.
Comment 12.3	Has no one ever heard of security guards? We get out of control people back in England and all other places and yet we still allow women there. It not being &quot;safe&quot; isn&#39;t an excuse to ban them and take away a basic right to freedom of movement (to the stadium) and association (getting involved with the stadium).
Comment 12.4	Because Iranian boys are looters they use swear, lots of F words and out of control so it wasn’t safe for women to be there
Comment13	BBC no mention about another historic 14-0 wi  by Iran, thats a new World record for any qualifying game.<br /><br />Edit: Jew controlled media
Comment14	If she wants to set fi;re to herself over football she must be really bored. Btw being English requires ownership of dogs, observing the football and more pa;gan do;g worshipping, that reminds me! Seen as you&#39;re experienced in talking behind peoples backs and going through peoples privacy and being sta;lkers! Come follow me over to corey shulister&#39;s channel and we can discuss further and see if je;ws have this culture of breeding dogs, ki;ssing dogs ass;,es and wiping the dog&#39;s cr;:ap off your carpet for your wh;ite english gf and her family and again bree;ding do;gs and paying massive attention to your dog as if it&#39;s religion. Btw have you any idea how ug;ly pi;g breeding is? Not surprised that you&#39;re not concerned seen as since primary school you&#39;ve also been bragging about your fore:.sk;in and the chee;se it collects for a perfect cheese sandwich for your gf&#39;s wh;ite mou;th right?
Comment 14.1	Nobody cares, Shlomo.
Comment 14.2	Any idea how many words I had to alter for the comment to post? Whi;.te man YouTube democracy.
Comment15	Still shocking that someone had to lit herself on fire to achieve this.
Comment 15.1	Lol people still believe this nonsense.
Comment 15.2	@Saracen Or just that people should go where they want regardless of their gender.
Comment 15.3	Achieve what? That women can now watch football with other men? <br /><br />Whats wrong with an all-women football match? They were allowed to do this.<br /><br />The woman could&#39;ve watched the football match on T.V , instead she burnt herself.<br /><br />She is martyr of stupidity
Comment16	Women only section. It’s something but eh that kind off defeats the purpose in my opinion.
Comment 16.1	What&#39;s wrong?
Comment 16.2	It is. It was only because of fifa that forced them to let them in .
Comment17	The fact that this is news tells you what you need to know about the Iranian government.
Comment 17.1	That they care more about safety of women?
Comment 17.2	@Smash A Commie well the first statement was already kind of untrue but 8 get the idea but this is just kinda bullshit
Comment 17.3	@Smash A Commie why are white supremacist as yourself so obsessed with the muslim world. Trolling
Comment 17.4	LostInPA about Islam you mean
Comment18	freedom feels good...
Comment19	Just another twenty years to understand to offside rule.
Comment20	man these girls are cute...
Comment21	This is not an equality issue, it&#39;s one of <b>female</b> <b>supremacy</b> . In a country where men aren&#39;t allowed to watch female sports, the entire world rallies behind the less important issue. Of course if men were allowed to attend female sports, the money generated would turn everything around and women&#39;s attendance revenue is insignificant. But neither the BBC nor anybody anywhere in the world wants Iranian female athletes to succeed.

Comment23	Interesting, Saudi Arabia and Iran finally enter the 21st century.
Comment24	Propaganda...
Comment25	Oh no.... what’s next? Women on construction sites 🤔 hmmm never seen a woman in the uk on a construction site. Why is that?
Comment 25.1	Look a bit closer! Growing force of women construction engineers, consultant architects! You wouldn&#39;t notice from your hole, keep digging Lol
Comment 25.2	Cos they want equality only in certain areas. Not the hard physical labour
Comment 25.3	Women in the UK are too out of shape to work there?
Comment26	Oh Islam such a peaceful religion
Comment 26.1	You are moron
Comment27	"It utterly ridiculous that things like this still happen <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23EqualityForAll"">#EqualityForAll</a>"
Comment 27.1	Some dumb cultures are just ridiculous... <br /><br />Remember... cultures are dead.... ancestors are dead... we are alive... why should we be bound by something dumb that people before your time created... think about it... lol
Comment 27.2	yes, equality for all, including Iranian men who can&#39;t attend women&#39;s sporting events! nobody told you about that did they?
Comment28	How doe a white male escape the feminist wraith? Become a Muslim. She’ll shut up then.
Comment29	Anyone in U.K. who watches live TV broadcasts on TV or radio or watched or receives any BBC TV or radio by laws has to pay for the BBC TV license.  Now if you don’t pay the BBC TV license you can be fined or go to prison .  Many people are confused and believed just because they have a TV in their house assume they have to pay the BBC TV license and they do not wish to face prison or heavy fines if they don’t so they pay it. Now it may be possible that they didn’t need to pay for the license. If you look at the rules they are often vague and intimidating should the fee not be paid. The government have a BBC charter in place allowing these laws to exist and be enforced.  The BBC is absolutely not allowed to be biased and if there is a bias complaints have to be filed via two concurrent methods via the BBC complaints service and failing the outcome of this the third line of appeal is through OFCOM . It really is very beurocratic and long winded .   There is no freedom of choice and there is unfortunately plenty of bias.  It is long winded and complex deliberately in order to maintain the current level of subscriptions to the BBC TV license which collects many billions of pounds per year.  In summary the government allows laws to exist which are unfair.
Comment30	You can barely see women in Arabic middle east have such faces, that are educated, confident, and fearless. Iranians deserve a brighter future. A secular and democratic free country for the next generation!
Comment31	Iranian girls are good looking lol
Comment32	Are you watching this, feminists?
Comment 32.1	@LibertarianPersian are you implying we are jealous of the penis? I would never want to have a penis in my life, vaginas are much prettier.
Comment 32.2	@hexxie0 Feminism is some sort of terrorism in western societies, in my opinion, most of you ultra feminists hate men just because we are men with a penis. I am happy for Iranian ladies as an Iranian man but I hope they won&#39;t go as crazy as western women any time.
Comment 32.3	If you&#39;re curious: yeah. Just totally failing to see your (nonexistent?) point
Comment33	About time
Comment34	They&#39;re hot what&#39;s your Instagram?
Comment35	Looks like a made up act, woman brought from the streets (homeless) to show something that is fake<br />What a typical Iranian regime
Comment36	Remember control is not choice<br />Freedom is choice<br />Religion is a Doctrine of guidance and should be remembered....
Comment 36.1	@Aphantom47 Get a grip plank
Comment 36.2	Johnny Feve ha ha ha ha jack ass
Comment37	Idiots.......<br />They see all the money that came from it and were probably like &quot;we should have done this earlier&quot; <br />If Americans are dumb for mass shootings these fucks are dumb for treating their women like complete shit......<br /><br />Real Tough Men eh? <br />Tell your women where they can drive and how late they can stay out? What they wear....<br />Sounds like a nice bunch of folks.....<br /><br />I&#39;ll wait for an Iranian female president......
Comment 37.1	@Haojun Li <br />You seem like the problem I mentioned previously.....<br />Sexist ass country.......
Comment 37.2	You need to take some meds. Seriously sir
Comment38	With their lip filler, nose -job  and Chanel handbag .
Comment39	The BBC is financed solely by the British Government with money extorted under duress from the British public.
Comment40	Now let them dance on social media without going to jail.
Comment 40.1	@Kurt S Okay then.
Comment 40.2	Tasin Al-Hassan blame the media, don’t blame me. Idk the laws of Iran, I just know what the media tells us.
Comment 40.3	@Kurt S They got jailed,but not for the reasons you stated above. You&#39;re just making it all so dramatic. The girls who were jailed worked for WhiteWednesdays,an American-based neoconservative organization hell-bent on altering Iranian faith and culture in the name of &quot;Freedom and Democracy&quot;.<br /><br />This has been the law since Iran severed ties with the US,UK and Israel in 1979. Nothing new. In general dancing won&#39;t get you jailed or fined.....well maybe unless you twerk or do it in a sexual way. Otherwise it&#39;s no crime. People in Iran rarely dance,no matter however it&#39;s legal. It&#39;s the diaspora in the USA that make it seem like as if native Iranians (80 million people) are some sort of dancers waiting to be free.
Comment 40.4	Tasin Al-Hassan so those chicks dancing in sorta revealing clothing on Social media, then getting arrested, was not real news?
Comment 40.5	They never went to jail for dancing. That&#39;s the narrative pushed by western media. People dance in Iran everyday. It&#39;s an ancient Iranian tradition.<br /><br />You can,however,go to jail for assisting foreign-back organizations like WhiteWednesdays. It only makes sense why. WhuteWednesdays is in bed with US warmongers like John Bolton and Madeline. These guys support Mujahedin E-Khalq,an Islamist terrorist organization responsible for helping Saddam Hussein&#39;s Ba&#39;ath regime gas Iranian civilians.<br /><br />It&#39;s in IRI&#39;s best interest to take them down and the vast majority of Iranians agree.
Comment41	Welcome to the 21 century where women are equal and evil politics can stay in the 7 century!
Comment 41.1	@m women get paid the same as men for the same job. If you want to make more money work longer hours or change your profession.
Comment 41.2	I wonder how many centuries is needed for human being to understand deference between equality and similarity.
Comment 41.3	@m <br /><br />I have, have you ever studied the gender earnings gap? It&#39;s not a wage gap, it&#39;s an earnings gap. Do 5 seconds of research to educate yourself on statistics and you&#39;ll see why all economics, statisticians, mathematicians and anybody no a moron are all laughing at that perpetuated myth.
Comment 41.4	@m How in this day and age are there still people that misunderstand the gender wage gap like this...
Comment 41.5	@m yeah yeah whatever
Comment42	Why is this news.
Comment 42.1	propaganda
Comment 42.2	A regime restricts a part of their regime. That is what the news is. Because news is when something important happens. This is important.
Comment43	Women don&#39;t know anything about football.

Comment 46.3	fafar gol - that is true, the Bible does not include the USA in the end times. <br /><br />Repent and find the True God. I pray for you brother! Fight for peace not violence.
Comment 46.4	Johns<br />in God we trust , but i am not sure if God trusts America anymore.<br />America is being ripped apart in slow motion.

Comment52	Nice job Iran, you&#39;re...slowly catching up to Ancient Rome that let women watch sport events 2000 years ago.
Comment 52.1	lol
Comment 52.2	@dragon hunter I hope so. Otherwise yikes!
Comment 52.3	@Pax you guys are getting trolled. Dude is baiting. He&#39;s not actually that stupid.
Comment53	To all the people who&#39;d been defending Iran during all the tanker incidents: this is the true face of Iranian regime. Iranians had the biggest chance to finally topple their corrupt government with the help of the US, yet you morons thought that America was the bad guy in that situation. Shame on you.
Comment 53.1	Paul<br />Do not white wash the american hands , who intervened  in other countries throughout history.<br />America with the warmongering policies ,changed the course of political movements  who were seeking Democracy. and that is as bad as overthrowing a government !!!<br />You seem to forget that regime change from the Shah to his succourers was all planned by the US.<br />Remember 1953 coup d&#39;etat against the  lawful elect prime minister of Iran(Mossadeq) in favour of the Shah  and again  the American hands behind  the fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979 ?<br />The one country that has caused most amount of chaos and blood shed in the world since the second world war is the US.
Comment 53.2	WTF? US defending people? lol
Comment54	Check out this new Facebook page it&#39;s brilliant.<br />Called 👉 The main meme&#39;s official 👈 <br />Or<br />Join this Facebook group if you hate Man United.<br />Called 👉 We ALL hate scum (man) utd👈

Comment 56.1	As if like women weren&#39;t allowed to visit stadiums in the 19th century.
Comment 56.2	Still a long, long way to go.
Comment 56.3	@paul han not that easy. America intervention only works on defenseless shitholes who has a few AKs and some fishing boats
Comment 56.4	@Pax - Fair point. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a healthy middle ground between stoning women and menstrual graffiti.
Comment 56.5	It would have entered it faster if America intervened in there.
Comment57	Iran and Saudi Arabia if Prophet Muhammad pbuH is alive, He will bamboozle you both for being damn too extremist. <br />Heck how could you censor people&#39;s feelings and emotions. Hapiness is universal too one wants to be lurking in corner sad.
Comment 57.1	@carte blanche <br />Wrong, during the era of the Prophet there was a daily chronicles and archivist peoples are well informed of the daily matter of their states. There was public treasury, banking and auditing
Comment 57.2	@Ultra Angel he didn&#39;t say  that prophet Mohammed is extremist , he said Iran and KSA r extremist
Comment 57.3	Yes true, in prophet Mohammed era no-one  knows about anything but now we know everything about life religion health &amp; wealth ..etc so I don&#39;t know why they r extremist
Comment 57.4	@Nature Boy u don&#39;t know any thing about extremist. U only repeat words like a parrot. Before prophet Mohammad no body even  didn&#39;t know what human right is. East and West people obey their leader&#39;s interests.

Comment 59.1	Equality in America? Are you for real ?!
Comment 59.2	U.S.A. = Devil&#39;s paradise<br />United terrorist States of America
