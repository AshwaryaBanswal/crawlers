Comment13	Let&#39;s get this crap going on its time what are we waiting for Christmas...
Comment14	I don&#39;t understand this lot.  They vote Boris Johnson in as PM then they all turn on him like a pack of wolves.  As for J Corbin .....  he is another breed, he is deliberately holding up this whole deal.  Strange to think a country like Great Briton would give up their rights as to how their country should be run, to have an outside country take control and dictate what can be done or not, I find very strange. Has anyone considered or even calculated as to how much money has been paid to the EU over the years and what it is going to cost for the divorce?  Surely this kind of money could have been spent in the UK. !!!!!!!  what a bunch of spineless sheep running this country.
Comment15	+ i. rob     -    I observe there are no such things as coincidences ; 39 000 000 000 is a ransom demand in all but name. The  &quot;Lord of Karma &quot; would be  &quot; DISPLEASED &quot;   with the    &quot; INTENTION &quot;  of UK politicians to pay this fee. The reason is ; the UK is a bankrupt country and is not allowed to give ANY money to any third parties under ANY circumstance as it is counted as  &quot; &quot; &quot;    &quot;THEFT&quot;.  The only action the  &quot; Lord Of Karma &quot;  would approve is   &quot; no deal &quot; with   NO payment.  Any signing up to any treaties with  a monetary  fee would of course also be treated as theft.   (past present and future)<br />                                                                                                                                                                   Now you know.<br /><br />The above comment was in reply to i. rob who stated :    39 illegal immigrants die because of EU open borders.    Brexit saves lives by closing borders and imposing customs checks.
Comment16	CON ALERT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />If it wasn’t about Brexit cons would lose hands down<br />We are being coned big time read the deal it won’t bring us out of the eu it’s smoke and mirrors

Comment21	Nigel Farage for PM. BoJo&#39;s a remainer.<br />General election. Remember 1381.<br />Nigel Farage for PM. He&#39;s the only hope for Brexit. Just renounce the treaty as of 29 March 2019. No need for anything from Brussels bureaucrats. No need for Article 50. UK is a sovereign nation.<br />Just renounce it.
Comment22	Irregardless of one’s view, that “stop brexit” guy has an incredible vibrato

Comment25	Shouldn&#39;t Johnson now get into a ditch?
Comment26	Jo Swinson is such a nasty lady. She has already said her useless DUP party will do everything in their power to prevent Brexit. So why comment on the deal in the first place. Swine
Comment 26.1	Toad swinson is Lib/fems mate , not DUP
Comment27	They want to prevent Brexit. Thats it. What the hell is wrong with Boris. Why request for another extension?
Comment 27.1	He has to request an extension by law
Comment28	This is bullshit. Johnson has failed. He really has. If Britain dont leave the Uk on the 31st, I&#39;m done
Comment29	Had 3.5 Years !!! General Election will Sort !
Comment 29.1	No, May held a GE and that just made it worse. But now we have Boris&#39; deal, we should have a referendum on that.

Comment31	What a shambles. <br />I have a MP that voted against her &quot;Leave&quot; constituency. That Labour MP lied to her &quot;Leave&quot; constituency, stating she would respect the Referendum. Once in power she&#39;s reneged on that commitment. She&#39;s now wants to stay in the EU. She now wants a 2nd Referendum. She refuses to face her constituency. She blocks everything that the Government tries to implement. She refuses to give the constituency a General Election. This has happened all over the country. A stalemate because of lies. Millions of voters without a voice. A Vichy Parliament against the British people.
Comment32	Remainers are propping up a minority Tory government with an unelected PM to stop the people from voting
Comment 32.1	I voted for Boris!
Comment33	Stop stupid brexit!!!
Comment 33.1	Fuck off!
Comment34	Time to scrap the license fee and get rid of the BBC. The BBC is the enemy of the British people.

Comment 35.1	hippy1922 Irish citizens have benefitted from the NHS with many travelling to UK for treatment and Irish UK getting free treatment on returning to settle.taking a strain off irish healthcare system.This will end and place the burden on irish citizens
Comment 35.2	"hippy1922 The EU is moving to a “Qualified Majority” and abandoning member state veto ,so Irish veto would not be <a href=""http://effective.it/"">effective.It</a> also plans fiscal governance of tax <a href=""http://affairs.irish/"">affairs.Irish</a> exports to UK are <a href=""https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/brexit/tradeandstatistics/"">https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/brexit/tradeandstatistics/</a> Also Irish exports to the EU pass through the UK.The Republic would have to spend a huge amount on infrastructure to ship direct."
Comment 35.3	@Jack This can&#39;t come into force without all countries agreeing to it so the Irish government would just veto it. It would be political suicide in the Republic for any government to give up the 12.5% corporation tax. <br /><br />As for trade a no deal Brexit would be challenging as the UK is a huge customer. The UK accounted for 12% of total exports of goods in Ireland in 2017 and 24% of total imports of goods. In services, it accounted for 6% of total exports and 9.3% of total imports in 2017. <br /><br />The EU is a bigger market for us

Comment38	If only the British people had a Second Amendment, the populace could rise up, storm Parliament, and take back their once-great nation.
Comment39	Shame, they can not amend a bill paused . Why waste time, call an election. British people demand MPs not get paid till after an election and hand back their pay over the past three years.
Comment40	🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Comment41	It&#39;s the EU with all these excuses they keep coming up with to delay it over and over again. It&#39;s insulting that our University smart men and women can&#39;t figured it out that the EU is making sure we don&#39;t leave. EU wants to keep it&#39;s doormat, the UK.
Comment 41.1	@Erica Stones I&#39;m just struggling to understand the argument your trying to make and want to understand your pov.
Comment 41.2	hippy1922 never mind and don’t worry about the offence thing I am used to it.
Comment 41.3	@Erica Stones You are not typing full sentences I&#39;m finding it hard to understand what you are trying to say no offence. <br /><br />None of what you say prevented the UK parliament voting for a no deal Brexit. <br /><br />What has amazon a private company got to do with Brexit?
Comment 41.4	hippy1922 OK, here’s one trading and boarders debates that were part of the Brexit. Then we promise of leaving at the end of 2016 then we were promise of leaving in 2017 which more meetings for a leaving date. Which then a debates on trading again and promising of leaving in 2018 it goes on and on. What about the way Amazon has been treating their employees by mistreating the foreigners, taking away their working rights and human rights act dismissed. I know I am ranting, but I am getting sick and tired of this and broken promises.
Comment 41.5	@Erica Stones You haven&#39;t give one way in which the EU has forced the UK to delay Brexit. You said the make excuse after excuse to force the UK to delay Brexit so tell me 1 or 2 of those excuses??? How has the EU forced the UK to delay Brexit?
Comment42	Going off todays events 24/10/19, all MPs are shitting themselves and instead of stopping Brexit they will be trying to stop a GE, those who are in Labour leave constituencies will be first in the queue for the toilets if Bojo gets his way!

Yes, people are rushing to get into the UK to join relatives before the doors are SHUT! the UK will be tougher for foreign terrorists. Thank God!<br />What a crappy legal system! 14 years for 58 dead bodies. 58÷14 =? Outrageous. No wonder we&#39;re a great place for terrorists!

Comment50	Eyes to the,,,  noses too the,,,, and the dick in the street,  well, what can I say about this vote,  😦 😴, I think everyone on both sides of this argument should just  Chillax and put the little brexit toy box away for now, and just everyone have a taste of the good-time we all had together before all this crap started A Great Christmas together. Not as remain or as leavers just as normal people,   don&#39;t worry, you can be sure it will still be there to get out next year to play with again, after all, it&#39;s always going to be as interesting as , watching a nail travelling at top speed on a not so smart motorway,  let&#39;s face it, you got more chance of  highways agency admitting that smart motorways are death traps than getting this sorted for Christmas 🎄 anyway, seriously relax boys and girls, if you don&#39;t you end up like the wanna be rag and bone man with a light up fag saying and tonight Matthew, I&#39;m going to be a noisy ,  distraction to traffic  and sing any old iron,
Comment51	BREXIT: Parlamentarismul britanic se retrasese in sine pentru a-si analiza atitudinea fata de parlamentarismul UE, similaritate a atitudinii Regatului Unit al Marii Britanii si Irlandei de Nord, reprezentind sintagma biblica ,,&lt;POPORUL ALES&gt;&quot;, nu numai fata de Europa, ci fata de intreaga omenire intercontinentala. Principiu universal: Royal Academy; Simbol: Magazinul Harrods, in care se gaseste totul destinat lumii, de la ac la elefant. Greu mai analizeaza parlamentarismul dual pentru a lua hotarirea finala! Ce ironie a istoriei, ajunsa pina azi, privind Inventatorul Original asupra utilitatilor necesare traiului optim al umanitatii! Aceasta este sinteza mea asupra celor difuzate si ascultate, cu convingerea ca, &lt;Magna Charta Libertatum&gt;, a lui Ioan fara tara, fiinteaza si azi &lt;Modelul Standard&gt; al Sufletului Universului. Presupun ca se stie de catre Londra.
Comment52	Great. So the main reason for Brexit was for UK to leave the european market. Now UK is leaving but is STAYING in the market? NHS is close to being sold off and becoming privatised? What was the point for Brexit again?
Comment 52.1	&quot;NHS is close to being sold off and becoming privatised?&quot; ..... Really?... LOL!....... We ain&#39;t staying in the &quot;Customs Union&quot;!
Comment53	We have the numbers. Give us a GE and we will tell you one final time, definitively, that the country wants to leave the EU
Comment 53.1	The problem with a GE is that people vote for all kinds of reasons, including party loyalty.<br /><br />A referendum doesn&#39;t have that problem.<br /><br />Give us a confirmatory referendum and we will tell you one final time, without any ambiguity, that the country wants to leave the EU.
Comment54	Apparently , judging from Jo Swinson’s mouth, dentistry and orthodontia is not covered in the NHS.
Comment55	<b>NATURALLY. THIS POST IS DENIED AS A COMMENT BY THE BBC, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS IT&#39;S THEIR NEWS</b>
Comment 55.1	"<b>Neither Richie or David would dare to read this out loud even though it&#39;s been on the BBC</b><br />(It was the US Fascists that reintroduced Hitler&#39;s EEC, est. in Berlin in 1942, starting in the late 1940&#39;s)<br />BBC NEWS CHANNEL<br />Last Updated: Monday, 30 April 2007, @ GMT @ UK <br /><b>US and EU agree &#39;single market</b><br />Ms Merkel will soon be Mr Bush&#39;s closest ally in the EU<br />The United States and the European Union have signed up to a new transatlantic economic partnership at a summit in Washington.<br />The pact is designed to boost trade and investment by harmonising regulatory standards, laying the basis for a US-EU single market.<br />The two sides also signed an Open Skies deal, designed to reduce fares and boost traffic on transatlantic flights.<br />But little of substance was agreed on climate change.<br />However, EU leaders were pleased that the US acknowledged human activity was a major cause.<br />Richest regions<br />Economics rather than the environment or politics was the focus of the summit, says the BBC&#39;s Europe correspondent, Jonny Dymond, from Washington.<br /><b>The two sides agreed to set up an &quot;economic council&quot; to push ahead with regulatory convergence in nearly 40 areas, including intellectual property, financial services, business takeovers and the motor industry</b>  .<br />Without the US there can&#39;t be any success in coping with a globalised world <br />European diplomat<br />Limited hopes for EU-US summit<br />The aim is to increase trade and lower costs.<br />Some reports suggest that incompatible regulations in the world&#39;s two richest regions add 10% to the cost of developing and producing new cars.<br />German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country holds the EU&#39;s rotating presidency, said last month that if the US and EU could set business norms today, they would &quot;secure the markets of tomorrow&quot;.<br />Since she came to office 18 months ago, she has made repairing damaged relations with the US a top priority.<br />Emission cuts<br />The Europeans said they were pleased that the US now officially acknowledged that climate change was happening and that human activity was a major cause of it.<br />&quot;We agree there&#39;s a threat, there&#39;s a very serious global threat,&quot; said European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.<br />&quot;We agree that there is a need to reduce emissions. We agree that we should work together.&quot;<br />But behind the scenes, says our Europe correspondent, officials were saying that not much had changed.<br />Ms Merkel will try to nudge the US towards a global approach to climate change before a G8 summit Germany is chairing in six weeks&#39; time, says our correspondent.<br /><b>But the US has consistently rejected the European approach of imposing national limits on greenhouse gas emissions, saying they would harm the international economy</b> .   !!!<br /><br />Comment failed to post."

Comment61	It is Tories plus Brexit party vs. Labour plus LibDems next GE. Polls suggest 65% of the seats would go to Farage and Johnson. The Remoaner mob can’t sabotage an exit anymore then!
Comment62	That facial mike is the wrong color! It ain&#39;t Orange
Comment63	If the conservatives cannot get it to bed by 31st they are toast
Comment64	The Brexit farce continues. A True Brexit won&#39;t be allowed to happen because 3 to 6% of the World Population own the Western World. The majority of the population is in debt, plus we shall be cashless within 10years, so the total control of the population of the Western World will have been accomplished and we will all be like she sheep. Big Brother will have total Control!
Comment65	If the EU was a creditable union of any kind, they would have thrown us out. The fact they haven&#39;t, discredits the other member countries whose governments would never behave in such a farcical and disingenuous manner.  They have given up a lot more than we have to join the EU, including their sovereign currency.
Comment66	Den of traitors.  THERE IS NO BREXIT IF THERE IS A DEAL!
Comment67	The ﬁrst lock is the transition period, which lasts until at least 2021. We must<br />hand over an estimated £39 billion for nothing, be bound by EU law and take<br />orders from an unelected Joint Committee operating under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Will the EU27 agree an equitable free trade agreement before the end of 2020? Unlikely, since all the goodies they want in the “future partnership” are set out in the Northern Ireland backstop, which kicks in automatically on 1st January 2021 unless superseded by a<br />partnership” agreement. Full ratiﬁcation by all Member States is required<br />before any such agreement can come into force. Achieving this in time to avoid<br />entering the backstop would be nothing short of miraculous, even if the EU<br />agrees to extend the transition period for one or two years. So it is more pay<br />with no say and a likely doubling of the Brexit bill to £80 billion, to be paid with<br />no reference to British MPs.Not only does the backstop carve out Northern Ireland a an EU province and set a border in the Irish Sea, it creates a partial “customs union&quot; that requires us to implement EU trade tariffs and  with no decision making powers.<br />Under highly restrictive “non-regression clauses”. the UK also agrees to<br />implement all EU emimnmental. competition, state aid and tax harmonisation laws, with the unelected Joint Committee and the ECJ once again able to punish us for any perceived backsliding. British farmers will be locked into a subsidy regime well below support received by EU27 farmers , who nevertheless <br />retain tariff-free access to the UK. British agriculture would be decimnted. It<br />means we could not support British businesses, give ourselves a competitive edge in new technologies where we excel. strike independent trade deals or diverge in key policy areas Such as good regulatory and tax Free EU access to UK fisheries to sit down as a marker for negotiation future “deal”<br />The Political Declaration replicates all the onerous “non-regression” clauses of<br />the backstop and requires even more surrender of sovereignty via participation in and funding of the EU’s aerospace and defence programmes, free access to UK waters for EU ﬁshermen, a full customs union and common trade policy, free movement by the backdoor under “mobility” clauses, EU control of UK agriculture via the state aid rules and in general full adherence to the acquis communautaire in all policy areas.

Comment78	Wto
Comment79	Reiterate -how did they vote without scrutiny of the 110 pages? Can 15/16 year olds who are now 18/19 year old comment ? <br /><br />Who wants to work til 75 years old to &#39;stimulate the economy&#39; which if not cheap enough after Brexit- revoke art.50- can only stimulate Irish Reunification &amp; Scottish autonomy. Pity people who planned on retiring in Spain or elsewhere in Europe. Moggy has Dickens to quote from shame on him - peddling the notion of &#39;choice&#39;. Maggie also over stayed her welcome.

Comment90	Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?
Comment91	We need a general election simple
Comment 91.1	pat dunne Newspaper sales are at an all time low.The BBC has 29m compulsory subscribers.
Comment 91.2	An election will solve nothing . The coming break up of the UK will solve nothing . The divisions in England  opened up by vested interests  such as the Murdoch media will  never be solved   . The real question will be who will take the blame once they are out of the EU . It aint gonna be pretty .
Comment92	Ffs
Comment93	It might be a version of Brexit but it is absolutely NOT a version of Leave.
Comment94	I don&#39;t get Johnson pausing/withdrawing the deal if the deal doesn&#39;t pass by 31st October! Johnson has got his deal through. What does it matter whether it is on the 31st October or 31st January? In either case we will will remain with the current free trade with the EU until the end of 2020. In either case we will need to discuss legal implementation of the new deal by the end of 2020. <br />This makes no sense. I can&#39;t help wondering if the reasons Johnson is doing this is because:<br /><br />1) he or his donors have a large sum of money invested in shorting the pound on 31st October, and face massive losses if the pound doesn&#39;t crash on the appointed date. In this case, it would make sense for Johnson to try to crash the pound which has been rising after Parliament accepted his deal, by sabotaging the deal if it does not take place precisely on the appointed date.<br /><br />2) Johnson is trying to avoid the new EU laws on tax avoidance due to come in on January 1 2020. These laws will give authorities the power to require disclosure of the assets of wealthy tax avoiders, money launderers, and fraudsters who currently avoid paying tax in the UK and EU by putting their assets in secret offshore accounts. I understand that if the brexit process is not complete by January 2020, then this EU law will be UK law until the end of January 2020 - enough time for the UK IRS to investigate and prosecute these tax avoiders. Is Johnson trying to protect wealthy donors to Johnson or the ERG by trying to force the deal to be completed or else crash out with no deal before end of 2019 at the expense of the rest of the country?

Comment128	Move the party
Comment129	Voted labour all my life but it&#39;s full of numptys and the biggest numpty of all corbyn is a traitor to democracy il never vote labour again
Comment130	I am always astonished who you brexiteers are blaming for this ongoing shitshow. So, lets recapitulate: It was THE TORY PM David Cameron who had the great idea to promise a referendum about your membership in the EU to get more votes in a general election. Since the result of the referendum was not as he expacted and wanted he pissed of and THE TORY Theresa May became his successor. She then picked her team of TORIES to negotiate a withdrawl agreement with the EU. After that was done (Nov. 2018) she failed to get that withdrawl agreement through the TORY DOMINATED British Parliament. But not only that: the only other option of leaving the EU (without an agreement) also was refused by that TORY DOMINATED Parliament. So your TORY GOVERNMENT had to ask the EU for an extension of your leaving period. The EU allowed this extension, but also gave your TORY GOVERNMENT the advice to not waste time on that issue. So your new TORY PM Boris Johnson decided the best thing to do would be to send Parliament on vacation. Now this blond bafoon means MPs should vote for his bill without even reading it...<br />Long story short: You guys blame the Labour Party, the LibDems, the SNP and the EU while it is obviously a TORY SHITSHOW.
Comment131	UK; do what the people asked in the referendum.
Comment 131.1	Their parliament wants stop Brexit. Bretrayal of democracy
Comment132	brexit is not the problem but the two different currencies which is dragging down the pound. UK has to leave at the end of the month and not linger again to the January 2020. no deal brexit is the only answer as the fat cats of EU try and control the union monetary fund. get out and make your own deals with your neighbours.
Comment133	Jo Swinson, nobody wants your opinion.
Comment134	Funny how nobody (BBC, Sun, Channel 4 News, Sky News) mentions how shit the deal is anymore.. or ever mentioned it for that matter!!! It&#39;s becoming just a binary between: a) remain in the EU or b) accept the &#39;deal&#39; (aka NEW EU Treaty document)... It&#39;s media strategists hard at work and plotting and creating narratives for the less observant voters in the UK to eat up....
Comment135	only 5% of the deal is t mays deal without the backstop so the mps already know its content......this an attempt to change it by amendments and extend it over 31st  <br />we need a general election.......get rid of the anti democrats
Comment136	Surely the ultimate irony is that <b>Labour/SNP/Lib Dems will always vote this deal down so they don&#39;t need weeks to scrutinize the details.</b> Three days or three weeks - they don&#39;t accept it so any scrutiny is meaningless. It&#39;s all a game to stop Brexit. Delay and delay and delay...
Comment137	What a lot of Brexiters dont realise is that agreeing a deal does not mean we just leave the EU. There is now a transition period when we are still in the EU and negotiate our new trading terms with the EU. This is a minimum of 1 year to end of 2020 but possibly a further 2 years to end of 2022. It will very likely require that further extension.<br /><br />What is also not understood is that commerce and business leaders across all sectors will be drawn into these negotiations.<br />Their main focus will be to achieve free trade and essentially the same terms as we enjoy now. The EU will in return want assurances that we would not undercut them by setting up new deals outside the EU in each sector - sort of quid pro quo. So Business is likely to readily agree this. So in the end it will be like being in the Single Market and Customs Union with that formally being declared.<br /><br />The differences of being outside the EU finally in 2022 or whenever will be in relation to free movement - and even there they are likely to relax the £30k salary rule in response to Business pressure. We will of course no longer be in the EU parliament or have any other representation. Nor will we be making payments to the EU beyond the £33b.<br /><br />So what was it all for? Business and those at the top of the economy will still be calling the shots. They will seek to keep things as they are now - in effect staying the Single Marker and Customs Union in all but name. The only true Brexit would be &#39;no deal&#39; but that is not going to be allowed by the establishment.<br /><br /> There will still be a negative impact on growth and jobs over the interim period at least and our influence would diminish as well as had to take rules from the EU without being able to influence them.<br /><br />Scotland is likely to seek Independence too so yet more negative impacts could unfold.<br /><br />So the benefits are hard to see - no economic ones and the rest delayed by up to 3 years and in any case intangible.<br /><br />But I suppose at any point up until we actually leave in 2023 we could just revoke Article 50 and &#39;remain&#39;. Worth thinking about!
Comment138	forget brexit. How are the BBC still puting videos out in 720p?? We are in 2019 where 4K is becoming the norm! What are we paying our TV licence fee for?!

Comment142	Absolutely disgusting that  remainers will not  accept this deal.
Comment143	Now there’s a thing god placed a firmament in the heavens to separate the waters below from the waters above lucifer placed members of parliament in the House of Commons to separate leave voters from below from the remain voters above and it was so?
Comment144	Why do they to interviews by those annoying people who shout all the time?? It would make sense to go to a place that is more quieter.
Comment145	lib dem and labour must put politics aside, and work togethor in the general election, to not split remainers vote. Three dominant parties (labour and lib dem being both remainers), in a two party election system will only benefit the tories. Lingering hope for britain to remain!!
Comment146	Probably the best thing to happen is an election to finally bring this fiasco to an end once and for all!
Comment 146.1	And how did that turn out for May?<br />Now that Boris had secured a WA, we should have a referendum on that.

Comment168	MP&#39;s don&#39;t want to leave?  i thought it was the will of the people/nation via the referendum vote over 3y ago which determined that?  MP&#39;s as the public servants of the people were meant to action that result and not try to bully their own agenda over the top of the public&#39;s vote and democratic choice.   Shame on you for dragging this out longer than it required and trying to sway the event from evening happening, that is not democratic at all but it seems the democratic vote now is only valid if the MP&#39;s agree with what the public have voted for.   Slippery slope to a dictatorship and considering the number of wars that were fought / supported under the democratic flag of &#39;your vote counts&#39; i think people are having quite enough of this from the MP&#39;s and those MP&#39;s should be held accountable.
Comment169	From a column &quot;The idler&quot; The Natal Mercury:-<br />&quot;A message from the future, year 2094:- The British Prime Minister visited Brussels today and asked for an extension to Brexit. No one can remember when the tradition started but it draws tourists from all over the world&quot;.
Comment 169.1	Very good.
Comment170	They just refuse to talk about democracy.

Get rid of these useless pieces of rubbish rasit labour party who anti semitism goes along side the Nazis and lib dems who are the most Undemocratic democratic party ever you are all a laughing stock of the world
Comment176	Yet again the BBC putting a remain spin on the events.
Comment 176.1	fricozoid1 no the bbc is the Brussels Broadcasting Corp
Comment 176.2	If you think that reality favours remain, then yes, you&#39;re right.
Comment177	Why did the Brits voted Harry Dunne to be the Prime Minister?
Comment178	Why didn’t Boris and ERG leave the EU on the 29th Mar? They lost their chance !
Comment179	So two remainers to one Brexiteer interviewed, bias BBC at its worst
Comment 179.1	@normal person What makes you think we won&#39;t have to follow trade standards (laws) to export to America? What makes you think that China won&#39;t make movement of their people part of a trade agreement? The fact is, you trade off all these things in a trade agreement, quite like what we do with the EU. Your solution is to jump out of the frying pan into the bigger, more powerful fire. The EU is China&#39;s biggest trading partner, a 500m population is the leverage we&#39;re leaving to offer up a trade agreement with 50m people. You do the maths.
Comment 179.2	@fricozoid1 trade deals don&#39;t involve law making or immigration... you don&#39;t trade these things. Making trade deals with other nations won&#39;t restrict our law making or immigration control...
Comment 179.3	@normal person All of those issues were compromised on whilst being a member of the EU. All of those issues may be compromised on when agreeing trade deals with other nations, especially the USA. We may end up with none of the things that you want.
Comment 179.4	@fricozoid1 many worry about the short term (collapse of the EU) and don&#39;t focus enough on the long term potential. Full control over law making, immigration, trade deals with other nations other than the EU, and the money saved that we send.
Comment 179.5	It&#39;s getting harder and harder to find an expert that supports Brexit...
Comment180	When the remoaner MPs want to push anti- Brexit legislation through both houses they can overturn hundreds of years of parliamentary procedure and precedence and force bills into law in record time. When Boris tries to get his bill through, suddenly the same MPs are bleating that Boris is trying to push legislation through without proper scrutiny. Bloody hypocrites.
Comment181	It&#39;s not even a deal lol
Comment182	It appears to be the best of both worlds deal, a remain deal, repackaged with a couple of minor changes. <br /><br />A general election can&#39;t help if it offers no real choices, and so one is left with the only conclusion that the party political system is so broken that a govt formed by any of the clowns that currently claim to represent us in parliament, irrespective of which team they claim to support would be illegitimate.<br />Oh and why does the BBC never discuss military/security union and the transfer of soverignty and subordination of legislation despite a supposed brexit. Manipulation and propaganda by way of exclusion of discussion?
Comment183	The deal has not been agreed by the people
Comment184	bbc loves filming euro flags, and host standing near shouting raving lunatics, BBC you should be ashamed of your blatantly never ending biased coverage..you are the filth of a TV network working against Britain...
Comment185	stand with... oh sorry

Comment 190.3	Gar Sm Haven,t you been told to clear off already.
Comment 190.4	It&#39;s a minority government. Parliament as a whole represents the people, resulting from the most recent election.
Comment191	Leavers ask to respect the result of democracy referendum but refused to respect the democracy process of the house. Pathetic 17.4m.....
Comment 191.1	@normal personwhat about the lies sold in the campaign by the Leave? I believe you will agree with me that they didn&#39;t vote for this mess...
Comment 191.2	It&#39;s not a &#39;democratic process&#39; the MPs are actively defying what the people voted for by purposely voting down anything that may progress Brexit.
Comment192	Respect the referendum,respect democracy, respect people’s will!!!Just leave EU!!!Otherwise you shall see people’s power!!!
Comment 192.1	李鑫 - You are talking about the UK parliament and using the word &#39;respect&#39; in regard to the will of the voters..... I&#39;m sure we all now know that is one thing most MPs do not posses... Any respect for their voters.
Comment193	I really thought I’d finally be voting conservative as I finally believed they had someone who would put our people and country 1st again and get us out on no deal. Instead we have another self loving prick who only cares about their party and not us!! Fuck you conservatives I’ll be voting for Nigel farages brexit party in the next election now!!!!! 😡😡😡
Comment194	Right if we now delay again , I stop work 🖕I’m done doing anything more for this traitorous country dirty people running our country democracy what democracy , we voted you don’t listen this is shitting on all of us so I will do no more I’m done  🖕
Comment195	The people of Britain voted to leave the EU. That&#39;s a fact without a deal. The remainers are stomping over the people&#39;s democratic referendum win vote that&#39;s a fact. Well we have a clear understanding that if the people of Britain who were given a chance to make a real choice about their future through the British Democrat system, don&#39;t do as they are told thay will be crushed down by those who are displeased with the result. A blatent act of bureacratic self-serving sabotage by the disfunctional remaine mixed party with no regard for democracy or the voice of the people. I really hope that all leavers will join together to bring about their majority democratic referendum win vote, and leave the EU with no deal. How on earth can you trust the mixed-up remainers agenda, blatently taken away the people&#39;s win vote, and so willing to give away British sovereignty to a bureaucratic   none democratic system called the EU.
Comment196	He gets a deal they pass it then reject it how pathetic. Labour should be ashamed.
Comment 196.1	@FINLAY Duncan not you, john john
Comment 196.2	fricozoid1 how ?
Comment 196.3	I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve totally misunderstood the situation
Comment 196.4	John john they didn&#39;t reject it
Comment197	The thing is, what do both sides really want? The leave side - who prima facie have the numbers in Parliament but appear desperate not to use them, indicative that Boris might in fact be a closet remainer - want a mechanism to ensure that we leave before the start of 2020 so as to avoid any new EU regulations or any chance of a future Government stopping Brexit. 31 October and no more dither and delay is simply a succinct way of expressing this position, but 31 December is really their red line. The remain side have different visions ranging from &quot;deal on their terms&quot; to 2nd referendum to unilateral revokation, but referendum between this deal and remain is a compromise on which the various strands of remain can all agree if convinced that it&#39;s now or never. Both Leave and Remain believe that they will win any decision on whether to hold a 2nd referendum should there be a vote in Parliament, and both believe that its a referendum they would win in the event that it did occur. <br /><br />So from the Leave side, why not say to the EU &quot;look we&#39;ve proven we can get this through, extend until 30 November so that those little dears can read through it line by line and take comfort in that, before we formally sign it into law&quot;, and from the Remain side, why not call the Government&#39;s bluff vis a vis Leave having the numbers in Parliament to stop a second referendum and those who were dead set on no deal but now seem converted, really being willing to vote this deal all the way through to law.

Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.&quot;<br />- Romans <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aTaYAXpuiY&amp;t=13m11s"">13:11</a>-13"
Comment 209.1	In other Words: remain.
Comment210	Its not a deal its a treaty, wakey wakey!!!
Comment211	I guess the 17.5 Million who voted DON&#39;T matter. That&#39;s democracy for you ;)
Comment 211.1	@Piet Kraan what matters is the majority.
Comment 211.2	Piet Kraan Both parties promised leave in their 2017 manifestos and Brexit Party won 2019 election.Dont they matter
Comment 211.3	I guess the 16 plus million who voted  to remain also don’t matter. That ‘s democracy for you too.
Comment 211.4	Obviously if you didn&#39;t vote then your vote doesn&#39;t count, and you don&#39;t matter.<br />Why on earth do you think you matter if you can&#39;t be bothered to vote?
Comment212	A simple free trade deal or customs union with no ECJ Jurisdictions could have been a far simpler solution to this crisis.
Comment213	i notice the way that the remainers have the brexiteers arrested when they shouted out at sour  faced soubry , but when the remainers are shouting out insults its allowed , funny that, but the bbc is not biased, leaving at the end of this month , lol , tatics from corbyn, he knows the tories will suffer and hopes to win  a GE , but does not realise he will never win .
Comment 213.1	It&#39;s called &quot;confirmation bias&quot;
Comment214	well they voted for the deal for now as they did not want to break out with no deal, right? As in it is blackmail.
Comment215	Brexit should be cancelled for the sake of the ethnic minorities.
Comment216	How many more bloody extensions do these clowns want. The members of Parliament should hold down their heads in shame, as should the BBC, who have so overwhelmingly proved to be contradictive and biased throughout this whole procedure. THE PEOPLE OF THE UK made a democratic choice. The so called, exceedingly well paid, representatives of those people have repeatedly strived to thwart that choice, aided and abetted by the BBC. And openly encouraged do so  by the dishonesty of the speaker of the House of Commons , who was emplaced to ensure a fair and unbiased control over the behaviour of these childish representatives. In any other country, Bercow would be found guilty of dereliction of duty and dealt with in the most severe manner. He can bleat on about enabling the opinion of the lesser members of the house using carefully worded sentences and archaic president to fool parliament, but at the end of the day, he has openly and wantonly controlled the undemocratic refusal of this parliament to accept the will of the people that pay their wages. The people of the UK voted to leave by National Democratic process yet the only democracy that these parliamentary representatives want to understand is that of their own bubble inside Westminster. Excise these representatives for what they are: a cancer in the body of democracy.
Comment217	🌼If the majority of people had voted remain. None of this would be happening. All of the MP’s would be happy. I think that many of the MP’s have forgotten that it’s people who have put them in power. And it’s people who will and can vote them out. They also aren’t looking at he fact that. <br /><br />🌺There are loads of people who have just had enough. People are protesting.Threading  acts of violence. How much longer do they think people will put up with this?🌺
Comment 217.1	&quot;If the majority of people had voted remain. None of this would be happening.&quot;<br /><br />-Well no shit sherlock. You want a cookie for pointing out the obvious?<br />If they voted remain then there would be no need for any further debate because they would just remain in the EU.<br /><br />Now, that they voted to leave then they have to discuss on the best ways to leave.
Comment 217.2	Thats english law for you you got police putting brexit supporters in hospitals I got pics and videos a young lad in manchester looking at x10 yrs in prison for touching a girl on the arm to ask a question  england is a mess you can thank lib dems labour and the snp

Comment 238.5	Macdonald Maurice Where did you hear it from,tell us.or did u make it up
Comment239	A reasonable time-table to give Commie Corbyn the Jew hater and the other traitors time to include membership of the customs union in the agreement.
Comment 239.1	@Gerald Gallagher <br /><br /><br />Dry your tears Cherub!... just because you married an Ugly Pig don&#39;t take out your frustration on brave Brexiteers.......LOL!
Comment 239.2	Another quality comment from a brexit loving moron
Comment240	Oh my seems a second referendum is coming.<br />Oh gee how will the BREXIT party lie more, can they get the 17.4 million voters united.<br />I mean first time people were uneducated after 3 and 1/2 years.<br />Will they throw in their own glasses and house just to spite their neighbour ?<br />And lower the property value. stay tuned as common mass are as stupid as HK protesters.<br />Or will the western education and morals triumph and they decide to save their own skin.<br />By reading what are the benefits and disadvangetages to themselves by staying in the EU. <br /><br /><br />Climax of BREXIT will end before january of 2020. <br />Last season of BREXIT I can promise you that ;)
Comment 240.1	@Death to the EU regime Oh my are you triggered, oh no more Will of the People ?<br />Now you realise referendum is not legal binding.<br /><br /><br />Oh gee I am predicting a change in UK politics with 16+ million remainers voting for Liberal Democrats.<br />So better get working on new LIES to get 17.4 million people together. will be it be NO DEAL Exit .. eh that wouldn´t get 5 million people. oh who is going to negotiate for a deal?
Comment 240.2	You do realise the government have the final say on any referendum....don&#39;t you?.... LOL!
Comment241	CLEAN BREAK BREXIT
Comment242	Is The Universe purposefully keeping this from happening? Someday (possibly soon) we will look back and wish Brexit never happened
Comment243	That guy shouting in the back ground, puts some night shifts in.
Comment 243.1	Rumour is he&#39;s funded by certain very wealthy Remainers.
Comment 243.2	He&#39;s a fake actor.
Comment 243.3	Indeed.
Comment 243.4	Sor os funded cupcake like our msm entertainment london police lib dems and labour
Comment 243.5	BFN TV He no doubts votes Labour, Blames the Tories even though they probably agreed to his benefits.
Comment244	They voted against the timetable to persuade the EU to approve an extension until January 21st, so they can amend the deal until it&#39;s unrecognisable, so that it&#39;ll be rejected by the EU parliament. It&#39;s all just a ploy for tactics to try to increase their odds of winning an election. Boris Johnson is very right to push for an election, but the remoaner parliament won&#39;t approve of that until his deal is dead so they can humiliate him further so they can increase their odds of winning an election further. Labour probably wants to blame the Conservative Party for their behaviour, but then probably won&#39;t be able to get a deal, and then use that as an excuse for a second referendum between no deal and remain in the hopes we vote remain. They don&#39;t care how long it takes, and what all this uncertainty costs. They just don&#39;t. They want to make people sick of it enough to vote to call the whole thing off because it&#39;s too arduous in a second referendum.
Comment245	Swinson, Corbyn et al can suck our nuts. Get it done and move forward
Comment246	Sorry 😐
Comment 246.1	Susan Grant not my fault I tried
Comment 246.2	@Linda Barker no shame felt for a proven LIAR

Comment248	Shows, no matter what the people vote, if it is not inline with the (establishment) then intervention until it turns to (establishment) line. This government is disgusting to the lowest level. Vote of no confidence with its MP&#39;s, it needs a cleansing and review of aged  processes.
Comment249	The uk had no chance to leave the eu.. there should not of been a referendum. But im telling you this now.<br /><br />There will more then likely be terrorist organisations made our of this. All because our mps couldnt stand together..brexit will not happen. And with that the trust of the people. So all you remainers who are scared of not being able to travel to Switzerland. Have mo fear. You have won. But with that democracy has died..
Comment 249.1	&#39;&#39;&#39;. All because our mps couldnt stand together&#39;&#39;.... You ain&#39;t British mate!
Comment250	CONFUSION OF THE HIGHEST ORDER
Comment251	There is known democracy in this country
Comment252	How much longer can this nonsense continue? Seems a little weird that the first vote wins when they don’t appear to have had enough time to understand what they voted for...
Comment 252.1	@Jude Lind more time to let the stabbing continue the grooming and msm to talk cack
Comment 252.2	Excellent response - very well done!  I would have been proud of that one.
Comment 252.3	Martin Thody Much much longer. They don’t want the Brexit Deal because it will affect hair EU pensions.
Comment 252.4	MPs have voted the deal through but want more time to add amendments and further scrutinise it.
Comment 252.5	The mp are the one holding the deal
Comment253	Let the ppl vote again, now they know what brexit means/+!
Comment 253.1	•c h e r r y• <br />Thanks chez 👍
Comment 253.2	Finally someone with sense
Comment 253.3	@Brian Smith Out with Deal or NO deal.<br />If no deal how come you are still negotiating.<br />Oh why don´t you show us how it is done.
Comment 253.4	Sam Ber <br />Don’t know about you but out means out ! Much the same as leave means leave. 👍
Comment 253.5	@the spartan Oh are you sure , can you even decide with the 17.4 million people to have a DEAL exit or NO deal exit.<br />Versus 16 million people Remain/Revoke ? auch prepare to lose on a real Vote instead of 2 Choices. <br />Or is life only made up of 2 choices. even elections you can abstain.
Comment254	There was no referendum held in Britain on changing the Constitution to leave the EU. There was a national opinion poll without any specific proposal.
Comment 254.1	@FINLAY Duncan <br /><br />There is only One way to leave the EU! .. by leaving the customs union and releasing Great Britain from the conditions of membership such as free movement of labour.
Comment 254.2	Death to the EU regime Why shouldn&#39;t we be able to decide how we leave the eu?
Comment 254.3	Talk sense mate!....the proposal was to leave or remain in the EU regime!...
Comment255	Go smack that loud mouthed prat in the gob

Comment 256.1	Yet still Brexit is inevitable,,, sucks eh?... LOL!
Comment257	Ah he&#39;s disappointed that the house has voted to delay, then pauses the bill.<br />Those pesky delaying remainers
Comment258	Why do they keep doing these interviews close to loud mouth losers
Comment259	Fuck Trudeau fuck islam fuck migrants
Comment260	Only the future will determine how this will all be weighed in the balance.
Comment 260.1	And finally, at the end of this mess,<br />UK and EU will have a lot less,<br />So Brexiteers, tremble and sober<br />After 31st of october,<br />For we all shall remember<br />The 1st of november.
Comment261	Two days is nothing. In the U.S, they sprung on a giant healthcare bill that repealed and replaced Obamacare with just a few hours to debate. And that bill was made that day.
Comment 261.1	And that was a complete failure
Comment 261.2	Sounds like lib dems in uk passing laws in 30min
Comment262	Why are all the BBC posts from the remain angle? Where is the vid of the pms speech? The BBC is getting so desperate.
Comment263	If you ask the kids what they want to do with the house and they decide to burn part of it down to save money on paying for gas and electric from the grid, would you follow that? If they tell you to drive your car into the sea or off a cliff, would we do that?
Comment264	Too fast?The British people voted to leave three and a half years ago!The British people are being held hostage by traitors in Parliament. All of which have huge Egos that get in the way of common sense!.
Comment265	Brexit, an exercise in self humiliation and futility. The EU should be dealing with real problems like Syria. Instead we have to baby sit the spoilt brats in England who peed on themselves again...
Comment 265.1	You&#39;re an idiot mate!.... the only thing the EU regime can do about Syria is accept ever more economic migrants to shag your ugly women while your taxes pay for them to sit on their arse all day and watch TV.
Comment 265.2	Why don&#39;t you go over to Syria and help sort things out?. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re village will survive without you. Other countries are low on the list of our problems
Comment266	You mean Boris is the only leader with an actual back bone,<br />well done Boris teach the parliamentary children how a leader, leads. The<br />parliamentary children who cannot take leadership must be shipped or tunnelled<br />over to EU Junka who will tuck them into bed and change their parliamentary<br />nappies for them.<br /><br /><br />It&#39;s not a mess, this is what leaders do, lead. This type of<br />leadership has been lacking from the British parliament for too long a time,<br />all snowflakes must report to their mommy and daddy the EU where Junka will<br />tell tuck you into bed and tell you all what to do and let the British govern<br />the British people.<br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />decker I do not like Boris but Boris is the only one that,<br />at this time, because Boris has no loyalty, Is the one that is putting on a<br />good impression of getting the UK out of the EU, for many years I have not seen<br />anything good about the EU, the EU told Greece to be the holiday destination<br />for the EU so must build as many holiday apartment as the Greeks can manage,<br />the Germans lent the Greeks as much money and the Greeks ask for then the<br />market fell and the Germans demanded their money back with interest, quadruple<br />Greeks committed suicide. The 3 leaders of the EU gave the EU Parliament 1<br />choice, not 2/3/4 just one choice to replace Junka whose retiring on the best<br />pension he could possibly ask for and everyone says that the EU parliament is a<br />fare Democratic institution. Why have two EU parliament, is that not greed and<br />opulence. Do you know the German and French farmers have never made a profit,<br />they get welfare benefit from the ECB, you cannot imagine the stich up the EU<br />is you fricking idiot. The Germans have a direct pipeline from Russian, the<br />Germans then sell that oil and gas on to the rest of the EU especially to the<br />UK for inflated prices, Yet Russian is under sanctions, now you know why<br />President Obama tapped Angela Merkels phone to find out what the hell is going<br />on. I could go on and I have nothing good to say about the EU but remoaners are<br />sheep too stupid to get it. I ask politicians and intellects why they want to<br />stay in the EU and they always say the same thing to stop the Germans and the<br />French from starting world war 3, how PATHETIC is that. Notice I do not want<br />the UK to leave the EU because someone told me so, or it was the figure on the<br />side of a bus nor any of the PATHETIC reasons remoaners think Brexiters want to<br />leave the EU for. Well done Boris and Nigel and I do not like either of them, I<br />do not like Nigel, I had to stop myself from puking when I put my cross in the<br />box for the Brexit party.
Comment 266.1	You should take off your tinfoil hat. Obviously you do not have the slightest clue of ​​how the EU works.
Comment267	FUCK the BBC
Comment268	“And a suspicion here [in the EU] that politicians in the UK are using Brexit to further their own political goals”<br /><br />Boris has forged his whole career around whinging about the EU
Comment 268.1	Autumn clarke because the PM is retarded
Comment 268.2	@pat dunne <br /><br />Totally agree son!... I&#39;ll never be able to understand why after a 100  years of independence you Spud bashers are still unable to live like civilised people without English troops baby-sitting you?
Comment 268.3	@Death to the EU regime  Best not involve your  tiny undeveloped brain in things you have no understanding of .
Comment 268.4	@pat dunne <br /><br />Ironic coming from a nation of bigots who blame Westminster and the English  for their inability to resolve thier own petty teritorial squabbles<br /><br />Time to grow up Mick and unite.
Comment 268.5	@Death to the EU regime Exhibit A
Comment269	The electoral commission has claimed they don&#39;t keep data on who voted in elections but if you look at the lib dem seat of Westmorland and Lonsdale a vast majority of voters were surely eu citizens who are resident or people from London registering their votes at their seconds homes. The uk public deserve to be given the actual data.
Comment270	why dear god you not conduct interviews in the studio? the people shouting in the background ruin the quality if your fine reporting.
Comment271	Boris didn&#39;t break any promises. Our remain MPs did. Did they want him to break the law? The remain mps are the biggest bunch of manipulative liars our parliament has ever seen in modern times and we had Blair! They want to tie us to a UK wide customs union, force another referendum on brexit and Scottish independence and split the vote between the Conservatives and brexit party. Leave voters need to vote with their heads and put a stop to their nonsense once and for all.
Comment272	When this idiot Boris going to ditch?
Comment 272.1	When people going to wake up police a putting brexit supporters in hospital and you think you can trust labour and lib dems snap out off Soro s trap
Comment273	the remoan-stream media doesnt know what to do with itself. it has completely screwed itself into a circle
Comment274	I have no clue what this MP Jo Swinson is thinking, but damn it I voted Leave, and Yes I thought I would get a Hard Brexit!!! But she and the rest of the Lib Dems are driving me crazy with their rhetoric!
Comment 274.1	I think there&#39;s no need to drive someone crazy who is already crazy on his own.
Comment275	Just a point of historical record. The US took more than 6 years to colony-exit [actually our secession didn&#39;t formally happen until 1812  under Pres. Andrew &quot;long knife&quot; Jackson and the British army burned down the White House--oops!]  from the UK and its 245 yrs later and we are not entirely free of the UK. THe Queen owns huge swaths of land in the US as well as NY which means I&#39;m very likely [as well as other Americans]  are still paying tribute to the crown in the form of taxes. Oh well I can think of worse. Paying Politicians for their stay at Trump resorts in Florida &amp; around the world. That I know I&#39;ve paid for.
Comment276	evaluation means nothing if you have to go that path, nuts, so many MP are nuts.
Comment277	We need a general election labour and liberal democrats are acting like children are vote mean nothing
Comment278	Corbyn has done all he can to disrupt and then plays the helper. Vile. Anyway the bill got voted in favour of the deal moving forward.

Comment281	Fxxk Labour and tory cunxt
Comment282	Britain never actually had a referendum. A referendum is a legal device to enact specific changes to a constitution. Britain had an opinion poll and then worked on the proposal!
Comment 282.1	Peregrine Slim Both parties promised leave in their 2017 manifestos.DOH winnning 80% of the vote

Comment285	British prosecutors at the Assange hearing were conferring with American officials at the back of the room to get instructions, just like in a post-Brexit Britain.
Comment286	2 days is not enough! At least a week.
Comment 286.1	@S S  I have been following the parliamentary sessions for some time now and they just all want to be able to stand up and speak and say what they have spent the previous evening writing down.  I think we should analyse this like we do at a sports event.  We could then see just what questions are real questions and which are real concerns and what portion is self-interested rhetoric and bluster.  We need to seive it!!!!!!
Comment 286.2	JK JK it’s not much different to Mays deal... they’ve debated the majority of it already for ages.
Comment287	Do you know what I really don’t care anymore. We had a referendum and it seems the opposition ( Labour, SNP, Lib Dem’s and co ) simply don’t care what the people voted 🗳. Not surprising really when the SNP are full time liars, Lib Dem’s backed down on a key promise the moment they got a taste of power and Labour, well what even is labour now? Yes they have the seats but what are they? Corbyn, Dianne Abbot and the rest, they might as well start waving red flags 🚩 and joining extinction rebellion on their anti establishment agenda. All self serving low life, if they had any courage they would have agreed to a general election when they were offered and tried to solve Brexit themselves. Absolute cowards! That’s just my opinion though.
Comment288	UK is truly democracy compared with Republic of China,  Republic of Korea, MP always physically fighting at Parliament
Comment289	The Traditions of the English does not include Atheism, Protestantism, marxism and the sneaky zionism that pretends to be beside you.
Comment 289.1	The Church of England is literally a protestant church... (The Irish remaining as Catholics (aka non-protestant, loyal to the Pope) is one of the main reasons for the conflicts between the UK and Ireland)  Also, haven&#39;t the British literally created the modern Israel?
Comment290	The Socialism of the Germans was sabotaged by the marxists. The Original socialism of Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel does not have the presence of atheism and marxism. The communist manifesto of Karl Marx is not the same with Socialism of Friedrich Hegel. Central Europe was known to be lands of the Kingdoms. The true memories of Germany and Austria when they are still complete as a nation. Right now Austria is divided into 5 different nations. May osterreich be whole again and the influenced of marxism and atheism be reduced.
Comment291	Online poll including Brits abroad please. The World Wide Web could end this.
Comment292	It’s all theatre. I tuned out a while ago.
Comment 292.1	please don&#39;t tell me season 3 of Brexit is ending on the 31st.
Comment 292.2	It is.<br />Just one big <b>FAKE ACT</b> by <b>ACTORS</b> who work for the globalists.
Comment 292.3	FINLAY Duncan I dip in every now and then to find the same situation. I don’t pay much attention because what’s the point?
Comment 292.4	Ollie Munday Your quite clearly still tuned in as your watching this.
Comment293	The people demand a Brexit, the government keeps stalling and pointing fingers, however they are to blame for going along with the bad deal to begin with.  Demonstrating their own incompetence
Comment 293.1	@killbotone a clean break is what it sounds like 3 years is a long time to have too have sorted something. It should have been mostly done. We&#39;ll have to agree to disagree because neither will change eithers mind
Comment 293.2	@Christopher Irving But what&#39;s a clean break? No more dealings? It&#39;s not possible. You knew this.
Comment 293.3	@killbotone again a clean break with sensible arrangements for future agreements not shouts of &#39;ordah&#39; of the speaker every 5 minutes by people trying to block it a nice clean break and a plan for future trade we&#39;ve had 2 years to do this. Stop saying we knew this would happen we didn&#39;t at all we just want a break we&#39;ve had best part of 3 years to do it I don&#39;t get what our politicians have done for 3 years. If we knew It would happen the brexit party would be in power and their not its still the conservatives
Comment 293.4	@Christopher Irving But what did you expect them to do? Just go away? That&#39;s not how democracy works. You knew this. You knew this would have to happen.
Comment 293.5	@killbotone I know it won&#39;t I&#39;m annoyed because there stalling and wasting time when they could be re negotiating deals or forging new ones instead of die hard remainers trying to block it we need to get on with it and stop dilly dallying
Comment294	Get out &amp; Exit  , Already !!
Comment295	Not from the UK just want to know why the brits have voted out what will happen what will they gain
Comment 295.1	@Amelzy bbe: That they don&#39;t know either.
Comment 295.2	Autonomy and the ability to run our own affairs.
Comment296	bangarang<br />j
Comment297	Its law we are leaving haha fuck u bbc
Comment298	Fair play to bojo, he did a great job. He got the deal in short period of time and he convinced europen union and Irish government .but sadly opposition especially dup ,ldp, labor, snp are outside of history. They agree not to agree. Briexit is like a hobby for them they don&#39;t want to let it go.
Comment 298.1	No he didn’t, he re branded May’s deal and accordingly due to the EU negotiation, the Johnson deal is worse than the May deal.
Comment299	If they have agreed on the deal why ask for an extension.Stalling for time because they don’t want to leave.The deal is the deal it’s not going to change
Comment300	We voted LEAVE, who mentioned a deal 🤔 the politicians who are screwing us over,
Comment 300.1	No problem. If you want to go, you just have to emigrate, for example to Australia.
Comment301	Total Disgrace, not what was voted on in 2016.Bring on the general election.

Comment 305.1	Trudeau is completely inept.
Comment306	Soft Brexit
Comment307	All the things they whinge about they had the last 3 years to work on...they should have been working every weekend.  🇬🇧 Out.  The people did vote for a hard exit.
Comment 307.1	John Priest nope
Comment 307.2	wrong
Comment308	British parliament is a bunch of clowns
Comment 308.1	"@Seer Seerwealth <br /><br />No.<br /><br />The UK is run as a Representative Democracy,  not a Direct Democracy. <br /><br /><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy</a><br /><br />You can&#39;t have a true democracy in a kingdom,  because the Crown retains more power than any citizen. <br /><br />Hence why every MP (and every official) swears allegiance to one family and not to the country or its population."

Comment311	THE NOSE TO THE LEFT
Comment 311.1	@Gunther H.G. Geick There was literally BIG NOSE chick on the left, when he said that.
Comment 311.2	THE EYES TO THE RIGHT
Comment312	I hate to be that American commenting on how someone should manage their internal affairs, but the UK sorely needs a general election to clean house.
Comment 312.1	Gar Sm whats it to you.
Comment 312.2	@Jack Johnson is a liar.
Comment 312.3	Gar Sm not yr business.
Comment 312.4	@Jack Very democratic.
Comment 312.5	Martin Rangel Please EU keep ruining countries
Comment313	One more week and Doris will be in a ditch YAY!!!
Comment314	Further time another three years perhaps
Comment 314.1	That&#39;s three more seasons.
Comment 314.2	Take the royal pi ss I know you can see videos and pictures of police putting brexit supporters in hospital
Comment315	I vote to remain .... No more brexit .... Enough is enough .... We are strong with EU...
Comment 315.1	@Martin Thody ya will see in next election... We cannot just leave this new deal is not good for the country .....
Comment 315.2	clifford fernandes maybe you did, but more people voted to LEAVE so we should leave ... it really is very simple
Comment316	congrats to Boris and his team. We&#39;re almost there.
Comment 316.1	LOOOOOOOOL
Comment317	So my prediction is that the Remainers will try to tack on 2 amendments to the deal.<br />1. They&#39;ll try to tie us to the Customs Union. This will fundamentally change the deal. No Brexiteer would be willing to accept that.<br />2. They&#39;ll try to tack on the requirement for a second referendum.<br /><br /><br />The combination of these would be devastating to Brexiteers &amp; entirely corrupt. It will force Brexiteers to vote for a second time (which we will not be happy about), but we will also be forced to vote between remain and a deal that will be a gross distortion of what Boris has layed out so far. Brexiteers aren&#39;t wild about the deal as it is, but I for one would take it. If forced to vote between remaining and a butchered version of this deal, my vote would be worthless. This is why I hate the opposition benches. While they chastize Boris for breaking the laws (that they make up as they go along), they&#39;re crafting ways to shaft Brexiteers out of their vote.<br /><br /><br />As a Brexiteer I just have to hope these amendments are succesfully thwarted. Of course the remainers will try to pass the amendments before a general election, because they know they won&#39;t get them passed if they lose control of the House. Again, you can take issue with the stunts Boris has played, but all of this is absolutely criminal. If there is an extension, the only honest thing to do would be to immediately call for a GE. Anything less is utter dishonesty.
Comment 317.1	You are not happy to vote on Brexit a second time - I assume you consider this undemocratic. But why is it democratic to hold general elections every four years?
Comment318	Not enough time to prepare to leave .... three and a half years is not enough...?!!
Comment319	The UK is fucked.
Comment320	The fools the fools the fools
Comment321	I voted for a NO DEAL Brexit in 2016 and that&#39;s as &quot;hard&quot; as Brexit comes. You do not speak for me, you traitor&#39;s slagbag. @Jo Swinson.
Comment 321.1	Gar Sm is it because yr ignored by yr own you attention seek elsewhere
Comment 321.2	Gar Sm No respectable decent person would subvert and make mischief in another countries affairs.
Comment 321.3	Gar Sm in fact you are the last person to tell people anything.its not yr place and ill mannered and rude.
Comment 321.4	Gar Sm why should you tell anyone in another country what to do.
Comment 321.5	@Jack I agree. Why should Johson tell the Irish and Scots what to do.
Comment322	Why are 90% of comments turned off regarding Brexit on social media sites  ?????
Comment 322.1	Because they don&#39;t want anyone to see that we still want to leave the EU
Comment323	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aTaYAXpuiY&amp;t=1m48s"">1:48</a> Our Boris and Priti Patel hooking up in secret?! GET IN, RKID!"

Comment 323.2	@Suck MyToe It was just a joke, though they do look perfect for one another. So adorable!!!
Comment 323.3	Awwww, say its not true
Comment324	BBC,  just has to finish every newscast with a slur on the Prime Minister. So calculating and petty.
Comment 324.1	Too bad they won’t put a bag over Jo Swinson’s head.  Or at least a muzzle.  Last time I saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it.
Comment325	The British political system is a big farce. How much longer should EU treat them like if they ware a civilized parlement?. No more pre brexit please , we are fed up whit UK blabla nonsense! Let&#39;s get to the aftermath now. We need to move on and start repair the political wounds on both sides!
Comment 325.1	SAHBfan yes
Comment 325.2	You mean, deliver Brexit and stop stalling....
Comment326	Ironic all about taking control not the EU has control
Comment327	After all meetings looks like back to step 1
Comment328	THERE IS NO POINT TO ASK BORIS FOR ANYTHING. BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET IT. <br /><br />HE IS WITH FIXED AGENDA FOR HARD BREXIT. REGARDLESS OF ALL THE SERIOUS RISKS TO PEOPLE    THE UNION AND THE ECONOMY. <br /><br />THE LABOUR MPs WHO GAVE BORIS KISS OF LIFE WITH THEIR SUPPORT ON MAY S HARDENED DEAL. AND JUST  AFTER HE AND HIS TEAM BEEN CORNERED BY THE PARLIAMENT. <br /><br />THIS IS BECAUSE THE PARLIAMENT WANTED A GOOD BREXIT DEAL FOR ALL AND NOT JUST HARD DEAL  FOR  PART OF THE 17.4 MILLION LEAVE<br /><br />ANYONE WITH CARE FOR THE COUNTRY AND PEOPLE WILL NOT TAKE RISK WITH A  HARD BREXIT. SPECIALLY AFTER HAVING 43 YEARS CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EU ,ALL THE FREEDOM AND THE DEEP CONNECTIONS PEOPLE, SERVICES,AND BUISNESS HAVE WITH EACH OTHER. ANY HUMAN WITH SINCE OF CARE WILL NOT SUPPORT ANYONE WHO IS TRYING TO HARM THE EU, UK REALTIONSHIP WITH HARD BREXIT.<br /><br />THIS JUST LIKE LEAVING YOUR LONG  FAIRLY GOOD JOB  SELLING YOUR HOUSE,LEAVING ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES AND TRYING TO RESTART A NEW LIFE IN A PLACE YOU DON&#39;T  HAVE ANY CERTAINTY OF A SUCCESS OR BETTER LIFE.  BUT ALL YOU HAVE IS HEAR SAY,JUST  GUESSING AND LIVING  ILLUSIONS IN YOUR MIND ,IGNORING ALL THE REAL RISK. GOING THROUGH ALL THIS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WANTED YOU TO DO SO.<br /><br />THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BREXIT AND HARD BREXIT IS.<br /><br />THOSE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BREXIT PROCESS IN THE HOUSE OF LORD&#39;S AND THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD REALLY THINK HARD BEFORE SACRIFICING THE UK FOR  SOME UNCERTAIN NEW FUTURE WITH SO SO MUCH TO LOSE FROM DAY ONE.<br /><br />THE SHOULD NOT HEAR THOSE WHO ARE SAYING THINGS WILL GET WORSE BEFORE GETTING BETTER. <br />THIS IS THE EXCUSES OF THE LOOSER,THE UNCERTAIN AND THOSE WHO LIVE IN DEARM LAND.<br /><br />WHY RISKING THE UK,UNION, PEOPLE, ECONOMY AND THE OLD GOOD EU ,UK RELATIONSHIP FOR A DARK   UNCERTAIN AND TOTALLY UNKNOWN FUTURE.THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF THAT FUTURE RIGHT NOW IS ALREDY HAPPENED JUST  SEE HOWMANY BUISNESS AND COMPANIES MOVING OUT FROM THE UK AND THE BILLIONS OF £ THE UK LOST SO FAR  BEFORE EVEN BREXITING. THE FORECAST IS NEGATIVE. IF IT WAS POSITIVE. THE EFFECT OF PRES  BREXIT WOULD&#39;V BEEN POSITIVE AND THE GBP WOULD&#39;VE GONE SKY HIGH .OVER 1.67 USD. 1.48 EURO<br /><br />THE EVIDENCE OF NEGATIVE EFFECTS WITH BREXIT SPECIALLY HARD BREXIT IS ALREDY WITH US.<br /><br />YES THE US ,CHINA,AND OTHER BARGAIN HUNTER ARE SO HAPPY TO PROFIT FROM BREXIT MESS. THOSE EXTREMISTS BREXITERS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS INCLUDING SOME LABOUR MPs ARE INFACT NOW HELPING BORIS AND HIS TEAM. <br /><br />THE LABOUR MPs HUMILIATING SUSPENTION BY BORIS AFTER TRICKING THE QUEEN FOR NOW FORGOTTEN. THEY JUST SUPPORED HIS DEAL GIVEN HIM KISS OF LIFE. THIS IS THE MAN THE HOUSE OF LORD&#39;S AND THE PARLIAMENT WILL BE VOTING FOR HIS HARD BREXIT DEAL WHICH IS BAD FOR THE UNION,PEOPLE AND THE ECONOMY. <br />BUT GOOD FOR SOME BREXITERS EXTREMISTS, THE FAR RIGHT, AND THE OPPORTUNISTIC COUNTRIES WHO ARE WAITING FOR THE GREEN LIGHT FROM BORIS AND HIS TEAM TO MOVE IN TO THE UK WITH AGENDA OF THEIR OWN. EXCLUDING THE EU AND CREATING BORDERS. BUILDING INVISIBLE  TRANSPARENT  WALLS WHICH ARE AS BAD AS A REAL BRICK WALLS. <br /><br />THIS IS THE NORWAY STYLE BREXIT BORIS.,FARAGE AND THEIR TEAM OF BREXIT LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS PROMISED??? MILLIONS OF PEOPLE VOTED FOR IT.<br /><br />MILLIONS OF PEOPLE VOTED FOR 350M A WEEK FOR THE NHS.<br /><br />THE HOUSE OF LORD&#39;S AND THE PARLIAMENT HAVE THE DUTY OF CARE FOR PEOPLE AND THE UK.<br /><br /><br />HARD BREXIT ISN&#39;T FOR THE GOOD OF THE UNION AND PEOPLE. THEY SHOULDN&#39;T HELP THE MAN WHO TRICKED THE QUEEN TO WIN WITH HIS DEAL WHICH HE COULD PLAY WITH AND MAKE IT MUCH HARDER AND PAINFUL.<br /><br />SIMPLY HE CAN&#39;T BE TRUSTED. HISTORY CONFIRMS.

We have a good strong government being dragged down to the levels of individuals who’ve never created a job or had any form of successful business in their lives.

Comment 341.1	...for the same reason as the one that people voted for Brexit.
Comment342	I would like to see a north south divide, let the northern people decide what is best for them, not the south.
Comment343	Why the same person shout god save the queen then Boris is a lyer
Comment 343.1	Julie Guthrie Yes but they did not say he lied.which you claimed.
Comment 343.2	The supreme court has ruled that Boris Johnson suspended UK parliament unlawfully. The decision was unanimous.
Comment 343.3	"Julie Guthrie Prove it because the court case <a href=""http://couldnt.so/"">couldnt.so</a> you must know something no one else does"
Comment 343.4	Maybe he think&#39;s more of the Queen than Boris as he lied to prologue parliament.
Comment344	If these politicans, and Nigel Farage, had worked this hard to change EU policy to help the UK then none of this would be necessary. Britain was a big partner in the EU, it had power. People like Farage just lied to you to aggrandise themselves instead of doing their job.
Comment 344.1	​@ANTON RUDENHAM And I hope we will soon have the United States of Europe without this American colony named UK.
Comment 344.2	We tried to change the eu for 43 years with no success, we always wanted it to be about INTERnational harmony rather than INTRAnational politics.<br />There&#39;s nothing anyone can do to reform the eu, they need to stay as they are in order to achieve their ultimate goal of a United States of Europe.
Comment345	This is a hard brexit wouldn’t be the case if the great British people 🇬🇧 woke up

Comment348	No wonder uk is sinking and sinking and sinking...
Comment349	All of this stupid, pointless Brexit process has taken far more of any sane person&#39;s time than could be justifying a millennium.
Comment350	I see all the flags of the EU behind u but wer the British flags or is that too racists
Comment351	Labour and the Speaker have made England the laughing stock of the world. Believe me I know, I reside in Japan.  VOTE them out quick.
Comment352	BBC reporter Kuenssberg, always looking for the negative against Boris&#39;s Brexit deal.
Comment353	Who else is praying for clean break Brexit?
Comment 353.1	@Ben Smith - Do you? Does anyone? The CBI, The Bank Of England, lots of financial &#39;experts&#39; will tell you they know - but they have got every prediction they have ever made completely wrong. What are you using, a crystal ball?
Comment 353.2	Do you have any idea what the financial implications for that would be?<br />I&#39;m asking honestly. Do you know what that would cost the country?
Comment354	So, Boris voted against leaving the EU twice and has chickened out of obtaining a vote for Brexit twice. Can anyone take him seriously?
Comment355	Regardless of leave or remain, can&#39;t we all just agree that Borris is nothing more than a liar and snake?
Comment356	So but law we have been out of the eu since 2016 the people’s vote
Comment357	BBC, you have a perfectly good broadcast studio. May I suggest you use it instead of competing with random people shouting in the background??
Comment 357.1	@Joe Bloggs. <br /><br />On another thread you claim you are gay, yet you try to insult me by using LGBTQ to demean me.<br /><br />Are you self-hating or are you a liar?<br /><br />It seems a curious attempt at a slur from someone who is LGBTQ.
Comment 357.2	@Arfur Fuxxakes arfur the lgbtq keyboard bedroom warrior 😂😴😴
Comment 357.3	@Arfur Fuxxakes I own 4 houses you berk.
Comment 357.4	@Jack <br /><br />Grow up or leave social media. <br /><br />You&#39;re too weak to cope. <br /><br />You obviously don&#39;t understand how it works.<br /><br />You two should get a room.
Comment358	People are stupid in UK.  They should protest in front of the parliament and let all the MP’s inside there to negotiate  and make laws or amendments until Brexit is done !    Don not let them out to go home !    Simple as that.   !    It’s become a joke  already
Comment359	3 and a half years NOT LONG ENOUGH ???
Comment360	We voted to leave the EU in 2016 so 🇬🇧
Comment361	Remoaners vote to accept the deal, but need time to scrutinise, that doesn&#39;t make sense.
Comment 361.1	@Michael Knight It&#39;s a 110 page rehash of Mays thoroughly scrutinised surrender treaty, don&#39;t think us fools.
Comment 361.2	It looks OK but we need a bit of time to check out the fine print, what&#39;s so hard to understand?
Comment362	Show must go on !   - Queen !
Comment363	More BBC biased reporting. <br /><br />I don&#39;t believe Remainers are sincere when they say they need more time to debate the current bill in the Commons. They don&#39;t. We KNOW full well what they&#39;re up to. And they know full well what&#39;s in it. Moreover, they can push bills through the Commons in double quick time with the help of the Speaker Bercow, when it suits their agenda.  Just look how these MPs, along with Bercow, have been in Brussels trying to stop Brexit altogether. Plotting in this way to undermine the government at a time when it is striving to negotiate a deal, is plain treachery.
Comment 363.1	@Jack how much?
Comment 363.2	"fricozoid1 election <a href=""http://please.bet/"">please.bet</a> you cant vote cos yr a shameless mercenary."
Comment 363.3	@Brian Hyde Good, so you&#39;d prefer that they don&#39;t rush through a bad deal. I get your complaint, I guess your timing is my issue.
Comment 363.4	Well it should be obvious from my comment that I am talking about Remainers who want to stop Brexit periods and not those like me who want to leave on the 31st preferably without a deal.
Comment 363.5	I suppose you&#39;d prefer they rush through a withdrawal agreement that keeps ECJ supremacy over our laws?
Comment364	"Can we have Boris, Blackford, and Corbyn decide this in a cage match?  We can even throw in that Stop Brexit guy yelling in the background.<br /><br />Brexit Thunderdome!"
Comment 364.1	@Open Comments Initiative lol it dounds like the bbc x11 remoaners against x1 brexit
Comment 364.2	Swurvin Creations Blackford needs shooting!
Comment 364.3	Corbyn would probably take his IRA pals with him
Comment 364.4	Now that’s a great debate deal!
Comment 364.5	Blackford would kick fuck out them all, big legend.
Comment365	Nice BBC work again showing the response to the Prime Ministers defeat but failing to show the counter response to the fake claims made that put many of them back in their place.... and the BBC claims its ain&#39;t bias.
Comment 365.1	@SAHBfan Why would they relocate away from the interruptions, that would just be common sense unless they had vested interests to give a weighted interview or report, I guess the millions they receive from the EU has little to do with, I personally don&#39;t give a shit what they claim this money is used for, the fact is they will lose it if we leave and will have to source it from the licence payers fee&#39;s thus losing what it is claimed it is used for or impacting other services.
Comment 365.2	Whilst filming in front of lots of EU flags, complete with resident EU Clown with a big mouth who shouts insults but never gets arrested...
Comment366	Revoke? People&#39;s Vote? Revoke? People&#39;s Vote? Revoke? People&#39;s Vote? Revoke? People&#39;s Vote...?
Comment367	Be very wary friends. Looking at this from a u.s. point of view.<br /><br />They will take your money, they will take your rights, they will take your freedom, and when you push back they will try to destroy you.<br /><br />this is exactly what the Communists Democrat party in the United States is doing to the people of America. But now they&#39;re even trying to pass laws to govern the world, and inprison a president who is trying to stop them. They are lying and they had taken control of our media to make the world see Republicans as the enemy. But we Republicans, are tired of lifting up radical dictators who steal our money, take our rights, take away our choices of healthcare so they control who lives and dies and it&#39;s all for slavery, communism and control.<br /><br />People, the Communists are at our doorstep and they are going to take everything including lives again.
Comment368	Why does the BBC think it’s appropriate to have thugs shouting obscenities in the background. They do this all the time, although I’d imagine if it was brexit supporters screaming like children the BBC would choose a less noisy place to film. I mean does the publics BBC tax not stretch to rent out a small studio?
Comment369	Frustrated? Good. Its all good for ending the current establishment. Death to the 2 party system and mainstream media. Long may they die. Over 7000 jobs were just lost at  CNN, Huffington Post &amp; BuzzFeed
Comment370	From Arizona outside looking in if I was the eu  i would have evicted you all after year 1!! And as far as deals are concerned. Teresa may wasn&#39;t such a bad deal? You bitched, and got a worse deal. Sounds to me that this Corbin character from labor is a communist. And would not be at all surprised to hear he associates with George Soros. But glad to hear the &quot;new world order&quot;  has had a solid arrow thru the heart! Because the UK has elected to walk their own path. One world order is evil and belongs in hell! Welcome to American trading now you will have prosperity of your own. We want your goods  we aren&#39;t broke we got cash to spend (unlike europe) were not regulated on who we do businesses with (citizens). got a website and a shipping label we buy shit, all over the world. No need to be trapped In the eu.
Comment 370.1	@John Escalante Oh you mean wars that you started for your Jewish overlords? Loooool, yeah right Europe haven&#39;t done a thing. Except that Europe is the ONE who accepted millions of refugees and not USA that is safe over the damn ocean. All those stupid European countries that supported your retarded wars in Iraq and Afganistan that are based on proven lies are now feeling bad and sorry about it. Germany and France were very smart about it so they said NO to the war in Iraq. Cause there was NO bio weapons in Iraq, the entire premise was false and in Afganistan your soldiers are simply there to control the poppy fields, basically, lol. You praise your government yet you aren&#39;t even smart enough to realise that heroin epidemics in USA started in these modern times and it&#39;s connected with US invasion of Afghanistan. Basically you are the biggest market for your own government that is pushing heroin on your streets and they don&#39;t give AF if you die or not. (how many overdoses happened in USA over the years?) Just like they did with crack in the 80s. And why would they care for your ass? It&#39;s just the way your government is. They don&#39;t care about the quality of your food so they sell GMO food to you, while all of that is banned in Europe. They don&#39;t give AF about the obesity of their OWN population. Only thing USA achieved is making one big mess all over the middle east. Let&#39;s not even talk about the Lybia. Ask Kurds what they feel about having USA as an ally. I bet they are not impressed at all. Russia did more in Syria than USA ever did. You know why? Cause USA DIDN&#39;T want to do anything for MONTHS and YEARS. Cause &quot;rebels&quot; in Syria were US proxys. When honest power like Russia stepped in that conflict and embarrassed the USA in front of the eyes of the world, then the backbone of Isis was broken. As i said... You are living in a MSM bubble. EU as whole for sure became much more careful about the USA since 2003 cause you are proven liers, and you were caught spying, and listening to talks of EU leaders like Merkel and others. It&#39;s enough that EU and Russia become close allies and it&#39;s basically game over for USA in Eurasia. Especially if EU and Russia also have good relations with China. There would be almost no room for USA in Eurasia anymore. You could still molest Mexico and Canada i guess. Looool
Comment 370.2	@PG trojka wanted  to troll you some more.  Hear bout the  middle east  today  cease fire between nations for centuries . All done by 50 little states, and one hell of a super power,  not one ounce of  European support!  But you need to  come get your  war criminals! !! There your  evil to house  now!! Have a nice day
Comment 370.3	@Trick C agreed lol nation building!  Although  I&#39;m not the best  diplomat, I&#39;m American, rude , truthful as hell with what I know  to be. Non apologetic,  and I don&#39;t live my life not offending folks. Never know  now the UK is free (in theroy) maybe I can trade some cactus, for haggas??
Comment 370.4	@PG trojka how far back in time does it take  to justify. All makes sense  as when we told the king to go get bent. Most of our colonist were from England  stands to reason  the language  and terms would follow? So what?  The start of our  nation is as you speak . And a few hundred years later kapow the world leader over all nations. How about  Europe oldest society   known  still sub par. Centuries to become  great and your  country is still asking permission  to act like a country. And it&#39;s 5 cars , 76 chevy blazer,a 02 Mitsubishi Eclipse,  a pontiac grand prix,a 2017 dodge charger and a Cadillac  ecalade,  before  you talk of the age  you must know these re highly collectable in the usa and worth more than a new vehicle,left out my 18ft sea doo boat with  6 cylinder engine  . what you don&#39;t know  bout Arizona is what I don&#39;t know bout europe. We have  forest, we have lakes, rivers,  with in 45 minutes  of my front door. And I forgot  to mention  we have a law called  self defense,  we don&#39;t have  to  be victims!!! Nothing deters crime more than  when I walk out my door with  my 45 cal. Long colt.  Strapped  to my side(I listed items so you can Google  (not 1 European  car, lol the Eclipse  built in the usa..
Comment 370.5	@John Escalante You don&#39;t have to combine anything? Oh but you do my friend. You sure do. In fact USA are 50 different states that united in a much older globalisation movement compared to the EU. How do you think USA got so big? There were only 13 original US colonies. Waaaaay smaller than USA today. You had bloody civil war to finally become united. EU is globalisation? Then what is USA? You bought many different lands from France, (Louisiana), Russia (Alaska), Spain (big parts of southern US), plus took it away from Mexico(also big parts of southern US) , and today even states like Puerto Rico and Haiti are part of USA. Why do you think Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Antonio, El Paso, exist in an Anglo country? Those are Spanish names. Why do you think there is Orleans in France and New Orleans in Louisiana, USA? Why do you think there is York in UK and New York in USA? New York even used to be called New Amsterdam. You even have Athens, St. Petersburgh, Naples etc. in USA. Everything about you was based on Europe, and created by Europeans. Lol. EU is going towards super federation and EU army. Let&#39;s just say that for your kids and grand kids there will be whole different world out there with EU and China. <br />You have 4 cars? Cool. Bet most of them are European a.k.a the best cars in the world. Makes sense considering that car as a thing was invented in Europe. I have one air condintioned German, European car. It&#39;s enough i think. Don&#39;t want to polute this world more than necessary. Oh and i am not British. You also seem not to know that entire southern Europe have great climate. In fact much better than overly hot deserts of USA. Southern Europe is hot during summer but certainly more pleasant, cause it&#39;s not a damn desert. It&#39;s green everywhere, with a lot of rivers,lakes, sea, etc. More than 300 sunny days in a year in southern Europe buddy. 200 million people live in southern Europe. All of them enjoy great weather.
Comment371	Any news on Boris and his sex parties in Italy as Foreign Secretary,  as the guest of the Russian owner of the Evening Standard ???<br /><br />Who the hell do we have living in 10 Downing Street ???     Didn&#39;t Dominic Cummings work in Russia trying to set up an Airline !!!    The U.K. needs its head examining for tolerating this situation.   This makes the Profumo Scandal look like an innocent swimming pool frolic.  Come back Peter Wright , all is forgiven.
Comment372	Im amazed by how they could vote for a bill without having had time to scrutinize it first? Brexit has turned into the strangest sorcery.
Comment 372.1	@Jack <br /><br />You&#39;re* full of shit.
Comment 372.2	@Jack You are clearly too dumb to understand the purpose of the WTO. If you simply had the time to google it up right now, you would find: <br /><br /><br />&quot;The World Trade Organization is an intergovernmental organization that is concerned with the regulation of international trade between nations&quot; <br /><br /><br />See how it mentions regulation, but there is no mention of facilitation of trade deals and such? That&#39;s because the WTO simply regulates trade: if a country has broken the rules, etc. It has absolutely no say in who trades with who and definitely doesn&#39;t just make trade deals with the UK, because, and I have to be very clear here, the WTO only deals with the rules of trade, and is not an economic bloc with members like the EU, ASEAN, etc.
Comment 372.3	Bach Hoang We buy £79b more from the EU than sell and pay £9b for the privilege
Comment 372.4	Bach Hoang Please can you tell me of any trade deal in the world that has to be paid for in £billions?
Comment373	😲😲😲😲😲
Comment374	the Kurds trusted Rump ...   are Brits that stupid, too ???
Comment375	It’s time to just walk away now, take the hit for a few years and build ourselves back up again, it’s not going to be the end of the world. We need to talk about something else and concentrate on domestic policy rather than foreign and EU policy. Time to pack our bags and walk away.
Comment 375.1	@Stuart That&#39;s part of your problem that the Brits haven&#39;t noticed that the world has changed since 1954.
Comment 375.2	"you are talking out your arse kid.this country was doing ok before we went into the common <a href=""http://market.is/"">market.is</a> usa /china/canada/singapore in financial turmoil?no there not,there is a great big world to trade with.even merckel said we would be a big competiter in the world market.shes scared we will out perform germany on the world stage.i was born in 1954.brits can deal with <a href=""http://hardship.so/"">hardship.so</a> suck it up!@Ahmed’s World"
Comment 375.3	As much as I understand the frustration in my honest opinion leaving without any plans in place and going for WTO rules is going to damage the economy severely. The day we actually decide to leave I would not be surprised if the pound nose dives to the point where 1.10 against the dollar, house prices are already about to get slashed and major international firms and companies will have zero reasons to set up shop in a country that had little to no trading links with its closest trading bloc.
Comment376	The DUP rang Boris to advise that they consider the Irish Sea a good enough ditch for him to die in, as promised.

Comment382	So why is Boris not dying in a ditch, as promised?
Comment 382.1	He&#39;s got Corbyn to destroy in an election first
Comment 382.2	Rhetoric, just hot air as is much of Parliamentary debate. Shout the other side down and you&#39;ve won.
Comment 382.3	EXACTLY THE MANS FULL OF SHIT
Comment 382.4	exactly!..as always a LIE..!!
Comment 382.5	Due time, friend, due time
Comment383	Brexit will never happen, the UN ,EU and the elite NGOs will never let it happen this is what causes extremism because people feel they have lost their ability to effect change through a democratic vote.
Comment 383.1	You could have left in 2016 with no  one holding you, your own Parliament is stopping you leave. But ofc, the EU is again to be blamed on everything. I really hope you people get out asap. You are poison in Europe
Comment384	Why do the brit news keep talking about this i thought the people voted to get out what is going on?
Comment385	It shows the state that this country is in that the lunatic shouting over the news report is 100% correct
Comment 385.1	they wont ever come to an agreement lmao
Comment 385.2	😂😂😂
Comment386	Brexit ffs hurry it up
Comment 386.1	DANNY DIRE just joking I thought I could make you jealous. I&#39;m comfortable though.
Comment 386.2	DANNY DIRE  pretty much. What does that have to do with anything. It&#39;s called losing a vote, deal with it
Comment 386.3	why are you a millionaire?
Comment387	So they are just going to vote the bill down now the extension is given from EU
Comment 387.1	@normal person Was the will of the people to keep ECJ supremacy over our laws? Nope? I thought not.
Comment 387.2	@fricozoid1 against the will of the people. You forgot that part. So yes
Comment 387.3	@J yeah MPs voting in parliament is anti-democratic...
Comment 387.4	Or take it to the Supreme Court, either way it is anti-democratic and one step closer to civil unrest
Comment388	That prick screaming has been going since I tuned in at 9 am, get a life!!!
Comment 388.1	this made me laugh🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comment389	and yet again and again..brexit is delayed..how many blows do the Leavers need to understand..these bloody xxxx... Westminster would never surrender the power to BJ as it wishes...brexit will only happen if the livelihoods of Brits are secured..otherwise..three words..<br />GO TO HELL !!
Comment390	No. It passed the second reading of the bill BEFORE it rejected the timetable, not after
Comment391	Delay, delay, excuse, excuse, panic mongering, lies...JUST LEAVE LIKE WE VOTED FOR!
Comment 391.1	Desmond Alloffo What foreigners? Other Europeans? You do realise that it only makes it harder for people from other European countries to enter the UK. It does not stop them, and it does nothing to control immigration from outside the EU. For example, Brexit does not affect immigrants from Asia or from Africa, which seems to be what most people who want a stricter immigration policy are concerned about. So, if you want to willingly lower your standard of living just because of this misguided thought, keep supporting Brexit.
Comment 391.2	​@Ousarlxs Fjsbvbg Because they think that they have found a way to annoy the &quot;elite&quot;. Brexiteers have the mindset of suicide bombers. They are angry about their miserable life and everything else. And they are happy to harm others even if it harms themselves too.
Comment 391.3	Cameron Roberts why is it that remainers believe that leavers didn’t know why or what they were voting for whereas remainers did?
Comment 391.4	@Ousarlxs Fjsbvbg because we hate foreigners and we want them out we dont give a fuck about business
Comment392	I don&#39;t care, I voted out. it&#39;s what the public want and those of us voted these backstabbers in, keep putting off. either way the &quot;common folk&quot; us who keep the country. will get f@cked over either way.
Comment 392.1	&quot;it&#39;s what the public want&quot;? More than 25 million of the electorate didn&#39;t vote to leave.
Comment 392.2	@DANNY DIRE smeg
Comment 392.3	WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM BREXIT WHAT DO YOU SEE IN YOUR FUTURE HOW WILL IT CHANGE YOUR LIFE?
Comment393	Boris needs to resign and stand with the people and force Corbyn to form a gov orGE <br />He needs to Stand by his word and not allow a deal
Comment394	British Schizoaffective disorder and etiology the BREXIT..
Comment395	Fuck Boris. <br /><br />Smirking POS. Parasite. Vermin conservatives.
Comment396	Brits need a second vote.
Comment 396.1	If there was to be a second vote it would be purely to clarify the first, which has yet to be implemented. The options would be leave with this deal or leave with no deal. To put the same question back to the people without implementing their previous decision will cause mass rioting
Comment 396.2	@Ungureanu Gabriel considering leave companings were found to be illegal and spreading propaganda there&#39;s a legitimate reason for a second one. Not just having a second one for the fuck of it
Comment 396.3	Are we going to have another referendum after the second? We&#39;ll do a best of 3 just to please everybody. Whilst it is  everyones right to vote not everyone should be allowed to vote!
Comment 396.4	yes we do, a second vote will solve alot
Comment 396.5	@TheGamer105 we need another! Leaving EU is terrible even with a good deal
Comment397	Hungary needs to do the right thing and veto the extension. Free the UK from their EU enslavement!
Comment 397.1	The globalists will allow anything to keep the UK locked in.
Comment 397.2	@Tamara Issa WELL SAID
Comment 397.3	Are you retarded? Why on Earth would Hungary or any other EU 27 have to sort out your mess? And if you look a little bit of what you are asking...taking back control but asking that EU member states make your decision for you. It amazes me how stupid some people are.
Comment 397.4	as if Hungary gives a fuck what Leavers want..
Comment 397.5	Enslavement? What? How?
Comment398	EU 4 UK O yet it keeps going into overtime
Comment399	Hahaha the EU must now make up THEIR minds..... THEY DID... MANY MONTHS AGO. UNDER THERESA MAY. What ARE are you people doing. You will crash and burn out of the EU. You are like a drunk girl who puked on the dance floor, getting hauled out of the nightclub by security and just before you get thrown out on the streets, you tear yourself loose and shout FINE... ILL LEAVE!!<br /><br /><br />Britain.... Will take whats on offer, or leave with no deal. Those are your options. The EU made their minds up long before Boris had a go. NOTHING has changed for 6 months. And Britain STILL acts as if they actually hold any cards in this game. As if they are even in a game at all.
Comment 399.1	We don&#39;t give a shit what the eu thinks, why would we?<br />You&#39;re just a bunch of mainly second world countries tied together in a reluctant political (dis) union and I predict it&#39;ll be game over for the eu project once the UK prospers outside the eu and back in the world where we should always have been.
Comment 399.2	I know right, beyond retarded
Comment400	How can BBC infer that this is political regarding Johnson, he’s trying to get Brexit done because that is what the people voted for!
Comment 400.1	NO LOVE BREXIT IS FOR THE BILLIONAIRES
Comment401	Oh good, keep endless delaying guys till the people forget what they voted for :)  On the other hand, there should be at least 1 year extension to solve this and there should be a referendum about style of Brexit in this period. They should ask people how Brexit they want to happen; BoJo&#39;s deal or No deal. I would prefer UK remains but result is clear.
Comment402	You can&#39;t just stall and throw tantrums to get a second vote just because you didnt like the first one  this is a democracy not a dictatorship and it should be upheld no matter how you voted most of the people in Britain just want it over and done with and have had all they can take of this bloody disaster!!
Comment 402.1	Hayley Marie In a democracy there are no limits to how many times you can vote on a particular subject, if there were, you would be stuck with the same controlling government party forever. Things change with time, and in time, you rethink and re-vote.
Comment 402.2	STOP AND REVOKE WE NEED TO REMAIN AS WHAT WE VOTED FOR AND WHAT WE NOW HAVE ON OFFER ARE A BILLION MILES APART
Comment 402.3	Hayley Marie So this is a democracy but another vote would be improper? Is voting undemocratic now?<br /><br />Seems like you might be afraid of  voters now that people know what’s at stake. Either way, seems like it’s too late.
Comment403	Muppets in politics.
Comment404	2nd referendum or a people&#39;s vote! <br />And before all you Brexiteers say &quot;we voted in 2016&quot;. Yes we did! And we also voted for a general election in 2017, should we never have a general election ever again because a vote went one way then? Should we never have another world cup? <br />People&#39;s vote!
Comment 404.1	@TheKhaosUK <br />You want me to single out one eu law and tell you it&#39;s no good?<br />ALL foreign made laws are incompatible with UK law.<br />We have a proven legal brilliance, all successful countries on the world stage run a common law system.<br />The eu runs an outdated Code Napoleon type thing which is utterly foreign to us.<br /><br /><br />The ECJ exists not to offer justice to wronged plaintiffs but solely to further the cause of European federation, everything passed by it must be beneficial to that end.<br /><br /><br />One law from the eu is too much.
Comment 404.2	@ANTON RUDENHAM which EU law in particular was so bad you needed to leave the European Union
Comment 404.3	@Tamara Issa Nope, no you won&#39;t Tamara.<br />I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re from but here in the UK we don&#39;t like being dictated to by unelected foreign civil servants, you are free to enjoy it but we reserve the right not to.
Comment 404.4	Until you get the result you want in order to accept it?  Democracy EU style.   People voted in 2016 and they voted for LEAVE. <br />BREXIT NOW!
Comment 404.5	And if remainers lose again, will they be happy? Nope.
Comment405	A second referendum, please!!!
Comment 405.1	"@Martin Thody <br /><br /><br />The first referendum was held on the basis of enormous lies shot by Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage.<br />Which have concealed the serious consequences for the British economy due to Brexit.<br />Therefore a second referendum voted on the basis of real data is absolutely necessary"
Comment 405.2	@Real Flow Another remoaner, give it up.
Comment 405.3	goff0103 no they won’t fool
Comment 405.4	What on earth would be the point - they haven’t honoured the first one yet!
Comment 405.5	silvano de lazzari you are deluded.
Comment406	One step closer to a no deal brexit then!
Comment 406.1	brit bazza2 I see you have deleted your reply. I will say this to you, I am not a close-minded person. If you can back up your claims by providing supporting evidence and/or link your information to reputable sources I would be more than willing to look into it to see if I’m wrong. <br /><br />I like to look at Brexit from all angles and I believe I hold an informed opinion on it. I do not think Brexit would be good for this country, however I do appreciate that people may think otherwise. There are both pros and cons to Brexit. It is my opinion that the cons of Brexit, especially a no-deal Brexit, outweigh the pros.
Comment 406.2	brit bazza2 I have not “massaged” the figures nor have I changed them in any way. I have simply stated them and put them into context. I also cannot see how the ONS, which is the executive office of the UK Statistics Authority (a government department), is controlled or funded at all by the EU. <br /><br />The UK did not “invent” human rights and the industrial revolution was a time of massive worker exploitation. It is the EU that protects the rights of workers in our country and others in the European Union. If we leave then there is no guarantee that those rights will be upheld, as parliament could change them at will. <br /><br />You are very misinformed regarding those zero-hour contracts you mentioned. The EU didn’t introduce zero-hour contracts into Europe, that is just preposterous. They did quite the opposite, setting basic rights for all workers including those on zero-hour contracts in acts such as the EU Working Time Directive. <br /><br />You are very misinformed about how the yellow vests protest started in France as well. The protest was started against an increase in fuel taxes and it had nothing to do with the EU. It seems to me that you have no real idea what you’re talking about and it’s a very dangerous thing to spread misinformation and lies about such things. Europe is stronger together, not divided. If you’re going to argue against that, at least get your information right.
Comment 406.3	@Ousarlxs Fjsbvbg figures can be massaged to fit any point of view. Look at where the ONS is funded from you&#39;ll find its paymasters are the EU itself so do you think the ONS is going to bite the hand that feeds it? I don&#39;t! It&#39;s like the opinion polls that Cameron relied on isn&#39;t it they will massage the figures  to suit their paymasters. Also something worth mentioning here is the small fact that the nation that invented human rights is the nation that invented the industrial revolution which is the UK so we are hardly going to suddenly deny workers their rights are we! One other thing to mention is the fact that these so called zero  hours contracts that the UK has just decided to legislate against were introduced into Europe by the EU. Another point to make here is the small point of the yellow vest movement across France and now Europe in general. This was started by the feench in protest against the EU regulations and directives on making it easier to sack workers in France and Germany which then when Macaroni tried to implement these laws caused the civil unrest in Paris. I don&#39;t think you want that to get out do you? So stick that in your pipe and smoke it because I don&#39;t care how you dress that up but the painful truth is that&#39;s just shot a torpedo into the midships of the EU will save workers rights argument hasn&#39;t it!
Comment 406.4	brit bazza2 I’m replying to you and rick wood collectively. Let’s talk about facts here. While it is indeed true we are a net contributor, which means we put more money into the EU budget than we get back (this is calculated purely in terms of our contribution minus the rebate), that 3/4 wages analogy you used is just incorrect and very misleading. <br /><br />We’ll use official statistics from the Treasury, the ONS, and the European Commission. Last year, the UK contributed 15.5 billion pounds to the EU. This includes a 4.5 billion pound abatement given back to us. This figure only accounts for the money that the UK pays to the EU (minus the rebate), however. Some of this £15.5 billion goes back to the UK public sector, of which a proportion is then paid to the private sector. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) calculated that the amount of money going back to the UK public sector from what we give to the EU is also 4.5 billion pounds. So with the £4.5 billion rebate and a further £4.5 billion going back to our public and private sectors that £15.5 billion net figure is decreased to £11 billion. <br /><br />It doesn’t stop there, though. That net figure only considers payments the UK government receives from the EU, not payments that the EU makes directly to the UK private sector such as grants to universities, scientific organisations etc etc. Generally, every year the amount given in grants is 2-3 billion pounds (this varies, naturally). The ONS and the Treasury do not usually take those numbers into account (however they are mentioned), so we will use official statistics from the European Commission. The EC has calculated a five-year average net contribution of £7.8 billion by the UK. This final net number considers the abatement, the money the EU sends to the UK government, and the money the EU sends directly to the UK private sector. It should show a more complete picture of the money that flows between the UK and the EU. <br /><br />Let’s put that £7.8 billion into context. Let’s also say that this £7.8 can be increased or decreased by a few billion pounds. The EU budget contribution is still, and always has been, less than 1% of both the UK’s GDP and total government spending. In fact the proportion of money that we pay to the EU compared to our GDP usually falls between 0.3-0.5%. <br /><br />Besides from this, believe it or not, relatively small sum of money we give to the EU, we can also talk about how that contribution helps create jobs and fund social organisations all across Europe and how the EU’s strong labour laws and regulations have raised standards of living in the UK and everywhere else in the Union as well, but I don’t think you want to hear that.
Comment407	All I hear is yeah YeAh yeah... In the background lol
Comment 407.1	"Brexit means Brexit we, 9,81...Rockband from wacken Germany....our Brexit song..<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Pt1YSdISw....lets"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Pt1YSdISw....lets</a> get Brexit done"
Comment 407.2	These politicians would say yeah to Hitler
Comment 407.3	Yeah
Comment408	🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺
Comment409	Why does the media compare Johnson with Trump, the only similarities are looks NOT policies.
Comment 409.1	both are bloody useless and huge LIARS!
Comment410	Kick m out ! Sick off this bullshit! Bye bye good luck!
Comment411	Why does Jo Swinson keep telling me what I voted for. Why does it even matter, what if I voted to leave because the sky wasn’t blue enough, it’s my vote I can vote however I want without having to defend it to anyone. 🧐🧐🧐
Comment412	It’s a pity that it’s taken this long for parliament to move on a referendum going on 4yrs. I wish the MPs took their jobs more seriously in 2016.
Comment 412.1	They do take the job seriously that is why they are not letting this gangster government to steamroll through a lousy deal
Comment 412.2	Yes, it should have been thoroughly assessed after the advisory Referendum of 2016.<br />Article 50 should not have been triggered until such feasibility studies had determined a path and effect.
Comment 412.3	They couldn&#39;t consider any deals until they were presented by May and then Johnson. <br /><br />It&#39;s the Tories that have taken it right up until midnight, because they refused to involve the other parties and they didn&#39;t want to give enough time for proper scrutiny and debate. <br /><br />They&#39;ve no-one to blame but themselves, yet they still blame everyone else. <br /><br />But then, that&#39;s what started Brexit in the first place,  people who blame everyone else.
Comment 412.4	JRT 4JUSTICE Any clue as to just how complex this is?
Comment413	Monty Python 2.0
Comment414	Brexit session 4...going well bullshit
Comment415	What gets me is there were 300+ people who were happy to sign a bill 150+ pages long with 2 days of scrutiny.
Comment 415.1	@Arfur Fuxxakes but yeah, leave voters are all nazis aren&#39;t they? Remainers are a bunch of fascists.
Comment 415.2	@Arfur Fuxxakes any gay person who voted to stay in the eu is an idiot. They have member countries with no gay rights whatsoever. Their citizens are free to move here. Talk about a culture clash. So much for the eu record on human rights. All they care about is money and protecting their gravy train. The Conservatives gave us gay marriage, not labour.
Comment 415.3	@Arfur Fuxxakes I am gay you moron. That&#39;s how I know 😂
Comment 415.4	@Jack <br /><br />You&#39;re still not making any sense and you&#39;re still stalking me on so many threads.<br /><br />You spew bullshit by the gallon, lie profusely and when challenged on your lies and asked to provide evidence,  you run away like the coward you are. <br /><br />You&#39;re a waste of oxygen.
Comment416	The white paper for this deal has been out for about a year already.<br />All this furore about two days being too fast is utter bullshit and is nothing but a stall tactic by the opposition.
Comment417	Boris just needed to &#39;seek&#39; an extension.  . He cannot be forced to &#39;obtain &#39; an extension because that is unlawful.  you cannot force the EU to give what it does not want to.  and the surrender Act does not say anything about negotiating.
Comment418	feel sorry for our jezza. been held captive by his remainer cabinet
Comment 418.1	@lucas Lufc alaw
Comment 418.2	Ben Monk Leeds would have done it better mot
Comment419	Just out of curiosity, didn&#39;t the people of the U.K vote for Brexit? What&#39;s going on? Why hasn&#39;t it happened yet, or is this just a stall tactic?
Comment 419.1	Parliamentarians are self serving selfish pricks. Democracy means nothing to them.
Comment 419.2	Personally, I think most have settled whether remain/leave originally; they just want Brexit to happen orderly and have some sort of plan so when we leave we don&#39;t have food and medicine shortages!
Comment 419.3	There was a vote but the means to have the vote(way it came about) was technically illegal; also this has gone on so long that a portion of the leave % have died so it&#39;s not a majority anymore (though ofc only including who voted, not any % who would have voted leave/remain), which was a minute win on side leave. But the hold up has been what kind of Brexit. This time PM tried to push a Brexit deal in two days; some have decided what kind of Brexit they want - some don&#39;t like the uncertainty of no deal, some want some sort of deal - hard/soft Brexit.

Comment420	Yep: lets do the live  discussion beside a raving shouting idiot.
Comment 420.1	Arfur Fuxxakes Your an attention seeking narcissist
Comment 420.2	Arfur Fuxxakes why are remainers against the people and democracy
Comment 420.3	chris leonard The problem is Labour are not for and hold british working class in contempt They are not a British Party
Comment 420.4	chris leonard 245 Labour MPs were and are elected on a promise to leave the EU
Comment421	Get out and vote!!!  Praying for you. I hope everything works out in benefit for the PEOPLE.😇💖
Comment 421.1	Yes, pray! Talk to yourself like that is capable of anything.
Comment422	Without enough time for such an important piece of legislation. You&#39;ve had years and the longer we wait, the more it hurts small companys and businesses.
Comment 422.1	Max the suggeston that MPs are being to ask hundreds of pages in a few days is total media nonsense. They will all have a comparison between this deal and the may deal. you really think lawyers etc. read every draft from scratch?
Comment 422.2	Mr JamToast what you don’t understand is that MP’s are having a deal thrust in their faces by a notoriously untrusted PM who is only giving them a very short amount of time to analyse the WHOLE THING, and he seems pretty eager to get this through regardless of whether it’s had enough time to be scrutinised. <br />Unsurprisingly, mp’s don’t like this.<br />I don’t like this.<br />It says to me that’s he’s trying to rush through some subtle small print or alternate interpretation of the wording he doesn’t want people noticing because it gives him room to exploit it for an agenda he doesn’t want people to know about.<br /><br />For someone who didn’t even turn up to any of the conservative leadership debates and had his campaign funded by SO GODDAMN MUCH £ in hedge funds, I’m not surprised at all people don’t trust him.<br /><br />That in addition to all the blatant spin doctoring and truth dodging (cue the “all politicians are like that” reply to which I say NO, SHUT UP, nowhere NEAR this bad, he’s encouraging this problem to get worse if anything)<br /><br />It all just SCREAMS corrupt liar.<br /><br />But hey, that’s just the way it looks.<br />To a lot of people. <br />It’s just a shame for him we happen to live in a democracy.<br />Where the view of a lot of people can make a difference.<br /><br />A lot of people to a superior degree is known as a majority.<br /><br />Boris Johnson has never had one of those since his incredibly questionable Tory victory.<br /><br />Do you understand where mp’s are coming from now when they say they aren’t being given enough time to decide on this?<br /><br />It’s really not as simple as clicking I agree to some terms and conditions for signing up to some shit <br /><br />It concerns the future of the whole country <br /><br />Times like these are some of those when it’s most important not to rush things and make mistakes like that
Comment423	The government are telling the DUP that they should be really happy because they&#39;ve got the best deal.<br /><br />So why haven&#39;t the rest of us got the same &#39;best deal&#39; too?
Comment 423.1	@Jack <br /><br />Grow up dipshit.
Comment 423.2	Arfur Fuxxakes Please stop saying we when your lying
Comment 423.3	Arfur Fuxxakes Its not yr governmen or your concern,yr a trouble maker and foreign agitator.
Comment 423.4	@Arfur Fuxxakes Look out of your window.
Comment424	MSM is just like the MSM in the states, imagine that MSM bias and should be unbias the ppl don&#39;t care about their opinion it&#39;s we the people not we the media

Comment427	I&#39;m going to explode with disappointment, why the f can u not just get it done!! Longest running joke in the history of great Britain that is now no more than a great mess
Comment 427.1	@adscri so complex it takes more than 3 year&#39;s 🤣
Comment 427.2	@Ron P well said
Comment 427.3	RAY DAY And just when did you last read, digest and vote on a simple piece of legislation, let alone an extremely complex one ?
Comment428	Alright Theyve done it again. No-deal Here we go
Comment 428.1	Tamara Issa in the case of a no-deal Brexit any specific deal with the EU may never be reached. The UK could in theory operate on WTO terms indefinitely.
Comment 428.2	This wasn&#39;t a deal. This was a withdrawal agreement that sets out a series of laws to be followed trough a transition period until a deal is reached. Which will take years. If there is a &quot;no deal&quot;, meaning there is a no tranistion period to reach a deal, then trade would be done on WTO terms until a deal is reached. And now..if a free trade deal wants to be reached EVER with the EU, customs union and European Court would again be as now so actually one would find that nothing has been reached with a 12 year long Brexit. Cuddos.
Comment429	We don&#39;t need the pause button <br />We need the fast forward one
Comment430	Here it goes again. You keep not listening to the &#39;people&#39;....THEY&#39; may stop listening to the &#39;toppers&#39; who then may lose their jobs.<br />  &quot;LISTEN TO YOUR PEOPLE TOPPERS&quot;. Time to throw some &#39;tea&#39; off the docks.<br />  (I&#39;m glad we  (US) won in 1776 &amp; 1812.)
Comment431	Kings ~ Queens ~ House of Lords 😂😂😂 no democracy in that country...Engalnd is the E.U.s bit@h....
Comment 431.1	Desmond Alloffo I did actually vote leave so please explain what you are talking about?
Comment 431.2	Well it was a referendum not an election, and we will leave the European Union and I hope we leave on the 31st of October, I’m simply asking to you make a statement which is actually backed by fact and not incoherent bullshit.
Comment 431.3	@IAdder XElite fuckoff remainer !
Comment 431.4	IAdder XElite you had a election ~ and it’s was to LEAVE the E.U. that did not happen . What is it that makes no sense ?
Comment 431.5	Rocky 36 That made literally no sense, I mean you are entitled to a view for or against Brexit, that’s your choice and the joy of living in a free society, but I mean come on, try and make a serious point and not spout irrelevant rhetoric.
Comment432	Running so fast exhausting yourself to get nowhere, for 3 years going on 4 now.
Comment 432.1	Things get to a point where they start to tear at the very fabric of society.
Comment 432.2	@Paul  Drysdale you can see videos and pics of police putting brexit dupporters in hospital
Comment 432.3	@Earth Man IT&#39;S NOT BREXIT THAT&#39;S AT FAULT. IT&#39;S THE TRAITOROUS LYING UNPRINCIPLED LIBERAL GLOBALIST SCUM WHO SIT IN THE HOC. BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT, DON&#39;T YOU!
Comment 432.4	brexit was always a three legged lame donkey and it will be unlikely to finish the race let alone win.<br />(flawed from the start).
Comment 432.5	Lets set a highscore for other countries

Comment 433.1	@Jonny Lewis No, I don&#39;t watch the BBC.... They are liars and pedos.
Comment 433.2	Did you not watch the video?? No deal is never going to happen
Comment 433.3	@Dullbaltic It will be like VE Day all over again.
Comment434	Peaceful!!!
Comment435	Still holding to October 31st........... A Delay will drive us all mad
Comment436	The opposition parties will try add  Customs Union access and another referendum to the bill, this won&#39;t be Brexit it&#39;ll be take a forced choice between a full on EU treaty OR Remain!
Comment 436.1	@the boss true!
Comment 436.2	Hence why you should remain! Cause otherwise you are fucked. Nobody in Europe with a sane mind wants to leave anymore.
Comment437	Boo!! Brexit now!!!
Comment 437.1	SHUT UP BRIAN AND GO TO BED YOU MORON YOU ARE MAKING A FOOL OF YOURSELF AGAIN SON
Comment438	Time we marched on London and took control of this situation.
Comment 438.1	It&#39;s hilarious that leavers talk about remoaners when all you do us whine and lie.<br /><br />This is why you lose any support that you need.<br /><br />You still don&#39;t have a plan that doesn&#39;t break up the UK. <br /><br />Paul, you should be careful of your promotion of civil unrest, the Family Courts only need to Google you.<br /><br />They probably did last time, which is why they banned you from seeing your children. <br /><br />They recognise an arse when they see one.<br /><br />I think the judge got it right. <br /><br />Deep down, you do too.
