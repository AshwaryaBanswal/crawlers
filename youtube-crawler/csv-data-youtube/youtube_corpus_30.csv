Comment1	Hummm these people in my country are warned not go to those countries but proceed going 3 bodies are brought from UAE dead every month stay your countries people
Comment2	Shame!
Comment3	Middle Eastern countries are the racist set of countries in the world. Their system is structured in such a way that, they see their selves as the upper race. Imagine after undergoing such inhuman experience, this poor girl was deported without her full pay and the perpetrators are walking free looking for another victim
Comment4	No Arab is better than a Non Arab<br />No Non Arab is better than a Arab<br />No black is better than a white<br />No white is better than a black <br />When these arabs gonna learn
Comment5	I utterly despised all Arab countries. Enjoy your short paradise here
Comment6	Please I request to all human rights organisation step in üôèüèª this people are the worse üò°
Comment7	they are just giving their maids for other people if you don&#39;t want this to happen just prevent maids at all cuz the idea itself is stupid <br />they said that they helped the girl by taking her back to her country why do you think she came over to work as a maid cuz her country is in shit economy and she probably doesn&#39;t have money  what I&#39;m trying to say is instead of covering this story that is going to solve a single piece of a huge one person problem try to cover the whole story about how no one should have a human maid or even try help these African countries  by offering them proper life and work but you&#39;re not going to do that cuz you&#39;re the media your business is just doing controversial stories for more attention
Comment8	Some Arabs are really sick people they normalise everything like its nothing racism is OK for them I am proud African this is disgusting
Comment9	When BBC says there undercover but really are part of it
Comment10	Modern day college girl feminists don&#39;t even give a fuck about this either.
Comment11	Unbelievable
Comment12	Google owns YouTube also. This video is exposing Google which owns YouTube which we are watching this on. Is this proof we are heading for a real change ? NO! Just enjoy reality and then return to the manufactured version of it.
Comment13	Slavery is still trending in all gulf countries,,, God help us
Comment14	Google and another just need viewers and money by internet traffic so they are equal responsible for such things.
Comment15	What are these terrorists doing in Silicon Valley?<br />Selling people for sex is terrorism against your own community and people as well
Comment16	It&#39;s only depends nationality, they can&#39;t take passport from eu or us.
Comment17	I live in Silicon Valley... this is completely heartbreaking. These big tech companies should most definitely be held accountable. Google is out here deleting/banning YouTube videos/accounts but can‚Äôt ban these platforms. California has been a continuous hotspot for human trafficking... not sure when enough will finally be enough to put an end to this global epidemic.
Comment18	It&#39;s not like that everywhere. I live in an Arabic country and I have a domestic worker, but I treat her with love. she has a day off.. she has her own room and bathroom.. she sleeps as early as she wants.. she has her passport and ID ..and she can leave whenever she wants. My kids are all grown up now.. I don&#39;t need much help around the house, but she doesn&#39;t want to leave because she can&#39;t get a job in her country that can provide for her family.. so we agreed she can stay for as long as she needs to. <br />she tells me horrible stories about her friends in other houses and it really breaks my heart.<br />but you have to know.. some of us are still human. both me and her are strangers in this country and we help each other out
Comment19	I just say CURSE TO YOU. <br />You are Muslims only by name in fact you are munafiqin.
Comment20	Not only in Kuwait
