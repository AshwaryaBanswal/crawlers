Comment3	Thanks Dutch. Sooo many people have your back. Quite literally. They don&#39;t have s*** on you. And all that matters is that we love and believe in you and we all know that you will be the reason so many people are better prepared. All the rest???  Don&#39;t even mention them anymore. They are not worth another second of your time

Comment14	When are the ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù going to give credit where credit is DUE ?!?
Comment15	The man who died was in Nevada. Not Ridgecrest. He was found pinned beneath his vehicle by Nye County Sheriffs. Of Nye County Nevada. Not Ridgecrest ,California. I double checked the newspaper article. So while getting the information out IS important---I am not sure a man in Nevada would have thought a Ca earthquake could have ever bothered him. Lost THAT battle of poor reasoning,I hope he passed quickly. As he WAS all alone.
