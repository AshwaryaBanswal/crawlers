Comment 39.1	How am I a moron. Name one good news coming out of iraq syria lebanon or palestine. The only good news you ever get in the middleast is either saudi dubai Israel or turkey. I think the partitioning of the middle east is a dumb idea. These countries syria lebanon whatever are two weak to solve any of their issues. They should nt exist all they do is drag othet strong countries into conflict. Examplr turkey with russia or Israel iran with us. Its time the world looks at these weak middle eastern countries as the problem not the battlefield. The best way to stabilize them is just to get rid of yhem. If you dont see that you are a moron.

Comment54	This was caused by syrians! A lot of them have been found and arrested. There are also of videos of them lighting the fires. Don’t believe what you see on the media, this isn’t about climate change. Bear on mind, I do believe in Global Warming, but in Lebanon, it was not the case.

Comment59	Lebanon Land of God! The fire has been put down by Gods rain hamdellah 🙌 the whole country was praying to be saved and it heavy rained in almost all country! God is good.  thank you for cyprus and greece 💜🇱🇧
Comment 59.1	Lebanon Land of God?🤔
Comment60	That&#39;s what happens under an islamic dictatorship.  &quot;Inshallah&quot;...  Apparently allah wills for his people &amp; land to be destroyed since they all inevitably turn into deserts &amp; hellscapes...<br />Are you muslims seeing a pattern here?  Islam is bad.  <br />You can&#39;t even get off your lazy asses to repair your own emergency vehicles but you want everyone else to drop what they&#39;re doing to help you?  <br />And then you think you&#39;re better than the rest of the world?<br />Get off your lazy, corrupt, entitled asses &amp; help your own people!<br />But then this is what you deserve for pushing to overthrow the legitimate non-islamic govt back in the 60s &amp; 70s &amp; engaging in genocide!<br />This relatively new islamic country is well on its way to looking just like all the others with all the same problems.
Comment 60.1	what are you talking about? Lebanon isn&#39;t an Islamic country... judging by your poetic comment, you sure are from Israel, you sound like you don&#39;t even sleep at night cause of your painful grudge to the point that you come on youtube to vent it all out 😂 keep venting and hiding behind your phone screen you wittle keyboard warrior, or maybe take a pill and chill

Comment 65.1	This was caused by syrians! A lot of them have been found and arrested. There are also of videos of them lighting the fires. Don’t believe what you see on the media, this isn’t about climate change. Bear on mind, I do believe in Global Warming, but in Lebanon, it was not the case.
Comment66	Repent the End is near .
Comment 66.1	@Mean Old Lady Lebanon half Christian 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comment 66.2	Clearly allah wants to destroy his own people... (hint: allah is Satan, NOT God.  Everything God stands for, allah opposes)
Comment67	Poor people in Lebanon and forest 🇱🇧

Comment 71.1	The full video of the journalist explains why they couldn&#39;t help - the fires were too strong and they can&#39;t reach the building.
Comment72	HELLO IT&#39;S ME AGAIN Lebanon is full of dirty covenant! Not united just a dirty covenant against me! All the worlds misguided worthless muck gathered in one spot! The proud full of himself Christian who follows a completely man made religion! Full of themselves je;,ws and muzlim boredom! Muzlims a people with no idea of music, emotion, and God. I really really really really really really really really really really don&#39;t want a thing to do with muslims but I am definitely King over them! They owe tribute and aren&#39;t paying it. They&#39;re trying to use me. I really am just after my money so stuck with one heck of a dilemma! They&#39;re not getting in heaven ever neither are you and I&#39;ll still get my money and power you&#39;re keeping from me. Yes I the Mahdi of end days am gate keeper for heaven and I will take my money which is the entire world as prophesied. Do you think because the government broadcasts my internet xhamster porn history all the way to the small jewish choir boy that it doesn&#39;t make me the Messiah? I&#39;m pure truth and would flip your 10 year old daughter over according to Islamic tradition which means you going through my Internet history and trying to dig up dirt doesn&#39;t phase me at all, which also means I can&#39;t stand English whites and care nowt for their thoughts. They won&#39;t give me my kingdom, they won&#39;t let me get layed on tinder and escorts are being funny with me too because police or somebody and co have told them to stay away from me! I&#39;m talking about strings of escorts ignoring me not just one. I&#39;ve been forced into my bedroom 8 years and my kingdom coveted under excuses of racism😫 AND BEHIND MY FUC;,KING BACK EVERYTHING YOU DO IS BEHIND MY BACK. WATCH THE HORROR I HAVE PREPARED FOR YOU WHEN I COME TO POWER. WATCH WATCH WATCH WATCH.

Comment 73.3	@Mean Old Lady Stop Your racism. Btw 60%+ Of Lebanese Are Christians
Comment 73.4	@Tommy and Evelina God will save me, not Jesus who is from flesh and blood. He was the son of Maryam and has no father. And he was a prophet send by God to warn the people. How can you believe his is God and the same time the son of God. Anyway, we both agree that there is 1 God and i respect your opinion but you should do some research aboout Jesus and islaam.
Comment 73.5	@Tommy and Evelina in lebanon if u insult muslims , christians will attack u , and same for insulting a christian.
Comment74	Climate change ...
Comment 74.1	@Mean Old Lady you&#39;re obssessed with Islam... sounds like your worst nightmare 😂
Comment 74.2	Yeah, blame the climate change fantasy, but not the islamic fantasy...  XD
Comment 74.3	FADY VLOGS do not blame Syrians ...
Comment 74.4	Not it&#39;s not because of climate change. Officals have caught 4 undocumented syrians with evidence of throwing molotov cocktails across the country
Comment75	&quot;Cause unknown&quot; There&#39;s something going on I suspect global elites aka the illuminati is buring down Lebanon forest and Amazon rainforest to speed up climate change what are your thoughts people?

Comment 82.1	@Mean Old Lady is just a troll craving attention, ignore &quot;it&quot;
Comment 82.2	@Mean Old Lady oh ya, tell me the #1 converting religion today, plz tell me
Comment 82.3	@SaM SaM - No, it isn&#39;t.  Because when they turned from Jesus to secularism, they foolishly let 3 waves of Fakestinians &amp; other muslims in which then turned around &amp; caused a civil war &amp; committed genocide against the native Christian population.<br />Their past is Europe&#39;s current predicament.

Comment 84.1	@Mean Old Lady i feel so bad for you
Comment 84.2	@Mean Old Lady i got bad news for you<br />Islam is here 2 stay but you would die one day 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comment 84.3	@Mean Old Lady YOUR OWN NAME DENIES ALK YOUR FALSE CLAIMS
Comment 84.4	Allah clearly isn&#39;t protecting anyone - allah promotes deception &amp; mass murder.<br />If islam were true, then the world would be turning into a paradise under islamic control, yet you have nothing but depraved dictators (just like muhammad was) &amp; islamic regions turning into deserts instead of teeming with life.<br />(The only places that have such things in islamic countries are under the control of non-muslims - which shows that their methods are superior to muslims&#39;.)<br />Islam is false.  Stay away from islam.  It&#39;s only for the most depraved of people, loaded up with sins while condemning others for engaging in the very things that muslims themselves do like rape, paedophilia, bestiality, murder, necrophilia, etc.
Comment85	Oh wow the hell in my country got international thankfully it’s off now and there is one dead only

Comment 96.1	Lea Daccache <br />Thank you.
Comment 96.2	@A so sweet ❤❤
Comment 96.3	ⵟⴰⵏⵉⵔⵉ it’s true. There are a lot of videos including ones where the police is arresting them because of what they were doing.
Comment 96.4	@Ibra Sar - That is NOT a &quot;both sides&quot; issue when it entirely comes from islamic jihad propaganda as a tactic to use against non-muslims.  They&#39;ve been doing it all over the ME for quite awhile now.<br />Just because you refuse to take the blinders off &amp; see it for what it is, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a problem on both sides.<br />The overwhelming evidence points towards islamic jihad.
Comment 96.5	@Lea Daccache <br />You insignificant hooker, please go toss a salad. Saying the truth now means I&#39;m the bad one?

Comment 103.1	Its cause if Syria 🇸🇾
Comment 103.2	India is Hindu Extremists Nation
Comment 103.3	@Dr Gilbert this guy gets it
Comment 103.4	This was caused by syrians! A lot of them have been found and arrested. There are also of videos of them lighting the fires. Don’t believe what you see on the media, this isn’t about climate change. Bear on mind, I do believe in Global Warning, but in Lebanon, it was not the case.
Comment104	God bless those peoples so much he can
Comment 104.1	tysm may god bless you
Comment105	Yesterday brazil and today its lebanon, tomo it might be be yours!!! So adopt some proper measures to fight climate change
Comment 105.1	This was caused by syrians! A lot of them have been found and arrested. There are also of videos of them lighting the fires. Don’t believe what you see on the media, this isn’t about climate change. Bear on mind, I do believe in Global Warming, but in Lebanon, it was not the case.
Comment 105.2	Shut up with the climate change BS.  It&#39;s a 100 year old scam that&#39;s been debunked time &amp; again.  <br />The long-term data does NOT support the CC theory, therefore the theory is WRONG.<br />CC fanatics are starting to sound like nutjobs of other religions.
Comment 105.3	Tripster60 <br />This was a deliberate burn as well.
Comment 105.4	Rambabu. Thota brazil was a controlled burn that happens every year  in the amazon. It wasnt a wildfire

Comment 107.2	And .....
Comment 107.3	greathey1234 <br />Syrian refugees, it’s on video.
Comment 107.4	Are these fires intentionally ignited by the government
Comment108	They really need to spend money on helicopter maintenance and firefighting trucks.
Comment 108.1	Lebanon is not a poor country. <br />In fact it’s a beautiful country with the best views.<br />The only problem is that the government is corrupt and politicians don’t care. <br />The only people to blame are ourselves and the government.<br />There was a fire in Syria too so I don’t think that they would burn down lebanon when their own country is burning down.<br />The reason is still unknown.<br />It’s not just lebanon, we are ending our own lives.
Comment 108.2	Yeah ,in lebanon all the money are being stolen by politians ,politians don&#39;t give a fuck about the people who got hurt in fire and the houses who got destroyed
Comment 108.3	@Yallah It was sarcastic reply to previous comment, no idea of Lebanon finances.
Comment 108.4	@Fonzie lebanon isn&#39;t poor, <br />We have a Big Tourism add value to Lebanon<br />We have exportation<br />Many Lebanese are out side of the countries and are CEO of very famous and known companies.<br />Lebanon can even start to work on its petrol(but better not because the gov)<br />Therefore no one dare to spend money because of the corrupted government.

Comment 113.3	"@hdhdbdh heeelloiii - LOL.  It&#39;s muslims that are bringing about the end of the world with their Satanic actions.<br />Islam is a cult founded by a hippy dippy, lazy scammer who lived off his first wife&#39;s wealth.  Within the 1st 13 years, he only gained 100 followers or so among friends &amp; family.  When he moved to Medina &amp; was given some measure of power, he decided to rob his neighbors&#39; caravans &amp; then escalated to robbing, raping &amp; massacring entire villages - averaging 9 campaigns a year until his death.<br />He hated Christians &amp; Jews because they objected to their history being used &amp; twisted to suit muhammad&#39;s lies &amp; desires &amp; they regularly exposed them - which is why muslims hate them today, all because they expose muhammad&#39;s deceptions &amp; murders.<br />Islam is NOT a religion of peace, but a pagan sex &amp; death cult that&#39;s killed more people than any other ideology in history - 669+ million over 1400 years.<br />Everywhere islam goes, the people become more depraved &amp; the land eventually becomes barren.  Islam only creates deserts of people &amp; the they inhabit.<br />Allah is the greatest of ALL deceivers - does that NOT clue you in that there&#39;s something WRONG with islam? <br /><a href=""https://answering-islam.org/Shamoun/allah_best_deceiver.htm"">https://answering-islam.org/Shamoun/allah_best_deceiver.htm</a>"
Comment 113.4	hdhdbdh heeelloiii I don’t think that adequately satisfies the prophecy. These events directly correlates with climate change and human development, and these things have been happening for ages but are now increasing in frequency due to climate change. I am an ex-Muslim, unfortunately I haven’t found religion much compensation — science provides most answers and satisfies most theories in Quran, though I don’t have anything against anyone, we are free to believe what we want to and thank you for responding.
Comment 113.5	@Safiye Sultan events such as this were promised to occur when its close to the end of the world. These involve signs such as earthquakes amd flooding etc. By tge way i hope you are having an amazing blessed day and thank you fpr being respectful and giving a genuine reply. May Allah Guide you. I found islam and its best thing that ever happened to me❤
Comment114	Climate Change will be the death of us all!
Comment 114.1	Sara Gacha <br />All these fires across Lebanon were done by Israel? Are you fucked in the head or something? We already caught those that are responsible.
Comment 114.2	A hun it’s done by Israel so please stop blaming Syria I am from Jordan
Comment 114.3	@Mélanie בלפורט <br />Because simply put, some people are just horrible pieces of shit. However, Lebanon is known for starting fires deliberately at night so they can make room for construction.
Comment 114.4	@Mélanie בלפורט we dont know yet, this has something to do with the government. There&#39;s something they arent telling us
Comment 114.5	@A Why would they do such things?
Comment115	Amazon, Lebanon, if it ends with ON then fire alert, please turn OFF inflammable objects.
Comment 115.1	Dry joke
Comment 115.2	And Indonesia
Comment116	WRATH OF GOD .... payfor your sins...
Comment 116.1	You are the wrath of a nutcase !
Comment117	Oh man it sucks for the people who got stuck in their homes, i cried. That is my worse nightmare and thats an awful way to die.
Comment 117.1	@Bryan Speech 100 <br />                I mean seriously this was the worst way of comforting somebody
Comment118	🔥👻🔥
Comment119	Poor people. Fire can move faster than you think
Comment 119.1	Your right about that!!!
Comment120	Send us their refugees. They will get a nice quick subsidized home like the Latins illegally crossing. All homeless Americans can wait for their subsidized homes. Waiting lists are an average 10 years now.
Comment 120.1	&quot;maybe they have a hot latin daughter I can date and have kids with....&quot;<br />Found his real motivation.  He doesn&#39;t care about his country at all (or white people according to another post further down), but mindlessly whoring around.<br />Neuter yourself.  The world doesn&#39;t need any more meth-addicted idiots like you running around.
Comment 120.2	Wow how educated some of u are...u see people suffering and all u care about is urself and how the illegal citizens are “annoying”? Open ur eyes... this is almost the end of the world....I hope that everyone talking about those poor citizens will suffer just like them and then we’ll see who will be the one laughing. Can u imagine urself being in their place and not getting any help? Shame on u selfish people. America is a huge country. For example lebanon is a really small country but yet so welcoming. I don’t think u would have to worry about citizens being in your country. As I said it’s almost the end of the world we all have to be hand in hand or else nothing will change.
