Comment1	Dutch thanks for the courage stand up to the so called earthquake professionals; and don‚Äôt let them get you down or argue with them if a discussion turns into an argument, let them go. Your observations of how earthquakes behave will make a difference in text books. If can get a job doing your earthquake thing and also maybe do all 2 times a week and able to come on at any time a large quake appears to be coming to tell, take the job. Do passion.
Comment2	Continue to watch I already know what&#39;s coming just not when
Comment3	Knowing what I know before God that&#39;s coming as I&#39;ve been saying which is getting more proven in time will come when they will not be able to gain and see you watching Ezekiel 33 all your information is being transferred to my new Twitter page bandlab music page and WordPress you talked about three three three one of God&#39;s numbers on me Jeremiah 33 verse 3 Matthew 6 33 Ezekiel 33 the triangle each one third
Comment4	Do you have a Mohawk???
Comment5	I live in Southern California and was curious about antipodal activity in Madagascar. It has been hit by only 10 earthquakes in 2019. The strongest earthquake in Madagascar for 2019 had a magnitude of 5 in mid-May.  I‚Äôm not seeing a significant  correlation. Just watch the ROF?
Comment6	Hey dutch!!! I agree you have nothing to prove. As far as Im concerned your word is golden. However, for the  naysayers, I was in Twitch last night when you were talking about England and you called it!! You had even mentioned somewhere more east prior to England!! I also want to add that i love that you are cracking down on rules and expanding available mods!! I even love more that you are adding more channels... Backing up your back-up!! Thanks for all you do and ml from California!!!
