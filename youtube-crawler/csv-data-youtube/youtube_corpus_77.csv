Comment4	From the time of Mark Twain LOL. I&#39;m related to him on my mothers side.

Comment6	Dutch the whole.pacific plate is rocking. Velikovsky said the shit will hit the fan when things start happening in south pacific. Not to fear monger but these big quakes and volcanos are everyday now.

Comment8	Laura wells has got info on Mt Rainier, gushing its mud water flow,,, she has links to &#39;the authorities&quot; in helicopters over the Mountain.... They closed part of the park.....  Omg is lava building and melting the glacier????
Comment9	If you guys USGS are so vexed and perplexed all the time it is time to resign as completely incompetent &quot;professionals&quot; God so pathetic!
Comment10	BOTTOM LINE USGS YOU ARE BIG FAT LIARS OKAY? USELESS TRASH,   UNPROFESSIONAL &quot;PROFESSIONALS&quot;,  REPREHENSIBLE  PEOPLE! Why am I so harsh with you all &#39;professionals&#39; at USGS?   One hope is that you will feel shame and get motivated to tell the truth. Actually, I suspect it just makes you dig your heels in to continue, but THAT IS  YOUR DECISION! I wonder did the universities you all went to have a class 401 on how to lie and submit to pressure?
Comment11	Anyone notice that the 5.5 Honshu quake has been pulled off the earthquakes list on Volcanos and Earthquakes. Com? Strange
Comment12	Aquifers? Perhaps, as we recall that from Grapevine north to Sacramento was a huge lake! Ducks and tules.
Comment13	Frak Ing contaminated groundwater. We are killing the future it‚Äôs sad to see people not caring. Chemicals in the ground leaving it there scary and wrong God help the future.
Comment 13.1	Future is past.
Comment 13.2	I&#39;m convinced our species destined to wipe ourselves out every time we become advanced.
Comment14	Michael,<br />Just wondering if you have watched any of the YouTube lectures by: CWU Geology&#39;s Nick Zentner?   I find him very interesting.
Comment15	You just blew my mind with the horseman crap. Never cease to entertain. Your my hero Dutchman!
Comment16	Just saw article about 6.1 in Taiwan and building collapses..with many ppl hurt. So I don&#39;t know if same quake or one since..Epoch Times story..and they are due a typhoon today as well.
Comment17	But the subsidence is caused by using too much water,  SMH.
Comment18	Figi Japan Philippines Indonesia...scary scary places to live !!
Comment 18.1	I find the US to be the scariest place to live, and not because of earthquakes or volcanoes.   I would prefer dealing with natural disasters rather than an insane government out to kill us all or sicken us.  I heard Indonesia is very peaceful, and the people are kind..no homeless...
Comment19	Dude! The whole Mark Twain reference by them makes me want to puke! But I&#39;ve been laughing so hard I can&#39;t find the time, what are they thinking?!! They&#39;re thinking we&#39;re all STOOOPID! That&#39;s what they&#39;re thinking!!
Comment20	I saw a bunch of other things. Weed...&quot;plate boundary&quot;, that&#39;s pretty much all that is there. üòÅ
