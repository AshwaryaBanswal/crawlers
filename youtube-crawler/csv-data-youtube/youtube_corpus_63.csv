Word is magma rising  beneath the ground is causing the fires.   <br />Taupo had two strong shakes about 12hours ago. 300+ felt reports, 2 said strong. Both were &lt;3 @5km depth. The crater lake heat continues to rise.<br />Two 5.8 mag Fiji &amp;  Kermadecs in past 10 hours.<br />Rain, rain and more rain in the Bay, lightning, thunder,  a chem trail and no visual of White Island.  Be safe and stay alert everyone. 🌬⚡🔥
