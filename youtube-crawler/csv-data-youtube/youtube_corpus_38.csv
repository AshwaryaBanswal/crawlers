Comment1	Signed their own death warrant bye bye Jeremy Corbyn.  Cant wait to vote labour again once Jeremy Corbyn goes.
Comment2	17.4 million people are going to vote Brexit Party. The Corbyn few have to change their attitude. They can no longer pretend the working didn‚Äôt know what it was voting for. The traitors from the anti-Semitic Labour Party think they know better than the people. We will see. We might be in for some change in the House of Commons after 400 years...
Comment3	Dismantle BBC Jews.
Comment4	God help Tories if they select dozens of women candidates on sole basis of their gender like under Cameron. they will just defect to the Liberal, feminist, reproduction hating, &#39;we must feel sorry for ourselves because the world is against us and squeeze copious cake into our holes&#39; parties once elected. this will keep happening. the Blair/new Labour inspired attempt to marry liberal and conservative values within the party has failed.
Comment5	December election,üìù  let see who will win? From the UK innocent deportee in Ghana Mr Mamadou Bendaloue. Morton Hall IRC and Colnbrook IRC I&#39;m still a deportee in Ghana since 27/11/14

Comment7	NO ONE WANTS CORBEN.....NEVER DID, NEVER WILL....MORE PEOPLE VOTED FOR BREXIT THAN ANY MILLENIAL PRIME MINISTER OR MP!!! WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU WON&#39;T CHANGE OUR MINDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Comment8	Richard Burgen the next unbelievably, back stabbing peoples representitive, get rid he doesn&#39;t support us!!!!!
Comment9	well done Boris sort the MARXIST scumbags out
Comment10	And with that terrorist sympathising loony at the forefront they dont stand a chance. Labour always bang on about hitting the super rich hard but the super rich are a fast moving target and can protect themselves so Labour will just go after the middle classes to fund all of their crazy BS. I‚Äôm no fan of both parties but even I know if labour get voted in the UK is finished.
Comment11	It&#39;s the &#39;STEPTOE  &amp; ABBOTT Marxist Corbyn Show with his backing group of comrades.<br />The 17.4 million people and labour constituenies have not forgotten the betrayal of your delaying and frustrating tactics to try and Thwart brexit.
