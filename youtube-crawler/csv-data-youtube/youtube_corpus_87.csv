Comment1	Hey man! You had said that if you live somewhere where one of the arrows on your map is that there should be concern. As far as I know, El Paso TX has a major fault running through it and an arrow is directly above the city on your map. Located in the furthest West of Texas you can go, could you maybe cover faults such as these that have potential to be catastrophic and why this particular area might be concerning?
Comment2	You know, I don&#39;t think that every idea that dutch has about how earthquakes can be predicted or understood better. But I like the fact that he is talking about it and attempting to do his best job with the info that the has. Why other professionals don&#39;t put their thoughts and ideas out is detrimental. Way more people should be actively talking about earthquakes on this level. Everyday analysis.

Comment10	So just type up earth quake in Indonesia on Facebook and see that its actually nothing new for earth quakes 7+ to hit that area in the recent 3-5 years. In zone of the ring of fire.
Comment11	Thank you for all you do
Comment12	Another 6.8 hit Indonesia
Comment13	I ask too many questions. Why does it appear that there are so many volcanoes in the (old term) Far East- that seems to be an ever growing area of the earth. This is getting more fascinating each day- I&#39;m hooked. I like learning. Thank you.

Comment17	Ahhh!!! 6.9 just hit Sumatra!!!! YIKES!!
Comment18	Why is it that when all the &quot;global political climatologists that work for &quot;special&quot; government agencies,  which by the way seem to have unlimited funding for churning out Albedo panic...Seem to always miss the fact that hundreds of active and slightly active Volcanos are pumping out thousands of tons of SULFITES which have a HUGE effect on global warming?? Volcanism is responsible for a large percentage of atmospheric particulates and exotic gasses which all add greatly to global warming! Thanks for pointing out the volcanic activity, it&#39;s so important to remember the critical role they play in the health of our planet. Thank you Mr. Dutchsinse! !!!ðŸ’•ðŸ’•âœŒ
