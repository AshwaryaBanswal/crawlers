Comment1	America is trying to meddle in UK elections again, just like they meddle in most countries elections - total disgrace, Trump can keep his corruption in America.

Comment6	Its dangerous when the news media tells the people who is right and wrong. Let the people decide and let the parliament honour that decision. The people on the top echelon of society seem to want to stop Brixit. But the unheard and the voiceless want to leave. Listen to their voices....

Comment9	Trump attacks Corbyn and everyone freaks out, but Corbyn can attack Trump as he often does?
Comment10	So let me guess. If Labour loses should I expect stupid acts of riots and violence from the cry baby society of the lazy scum across the country. <br /><br />The media spoon feeds you this brain washing shit, because you&#39;re the ones sat at home not going to work and taking advantage of social benefits. You&#39;ve got more time spent online somehow becoming &quot;activists&quot;.
Comment11	Americans have always hated communists.
Comment12	Without the European Union, we have no protection. It leaves the door open to everything, anything, food,  dead dog,  medicine, which usually cost us Â£5 would cost 150. Leaving the European Union means,  our government answers to no one, especially us, big big mistake. People wake up contaminated food extortion medicine prices welfare state being banished. Going back to the Victorian times when the rich got richer and the poor got poorer. Wake up
Comment13	Jeremy Corbyn Labour, if he promised to call a EU  referendum I would say, he has a chance to become Prime Minister. Even  the Lib Dems, anyone but Boris,
Comment14	UK is up for sale, Boris has made a deal with Trump the NHS is on the table. He will deny it but watch  the programme.  Everyone out there! Please look at, a recent programme,   spotlight or panorama  on Trump and Boris&#39;s,  and the NHS. Get Trump Out, and get Boris out, let us get the Conservatives out.  Boris is  a traitor to the country.

Comment18	Donald Trump needs to keep his beak out. Our country doesn&#39;t need advice from that idiot. I would have thought he&#39;s got enough troubles of his own,( of his own making at that).Hopefully when the time comes , he will get voted out, he has no idea how to behave as a world leader.
Comment19	This is good coming from Donald the Russian Trump , He used the Russians to get into the white house and still sleeps with Putin  .
