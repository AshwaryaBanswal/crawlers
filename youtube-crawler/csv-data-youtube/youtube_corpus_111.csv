Comment5	Didn&#39;t this guy say he was going to retire and even cry about it? When is he leaving? Not impartial and will be better for the Parliament when he&#39;s gone.
Comment6	To many threats of ‚ÄúNo-Deal‚Äù Brexit, and not enough action as usual...   ‚ÄúBercow Corbyn &amp; Co‚Äù are taking the piss with the nod from from their mates in the EU who must be obeyed or else....   God, it‚Äôs so embarrassing as sad little Britain gets arse whipped by the EU with a little help from the UK‚Äôs ‚ÄúRemain‚Äù traitors...

Comment16	I always thought that holding a referendum and having politicians declared they would abide by the decision of the people‚Äôs referendum is what paid Employees of the people do, they are making British politics an absolute side show with their lack of integrity, and a total lack of respect for the Majority of people who voted to leave the EU. <br /><br />They like most of the left now say they didn‚Äôt know what they were voting for and use their insults, this is what happened with the American election of Donald Trump and the Australia Election of Scott Morrison and now Britext. <br /><br />If I behaved like this mob without integrity or respect for those who voted and then say what we put forward is not what we meant, my integrity, respect and career would have been over,<br /><br />The Queen should use her powers to dissolve the parliament and call for a General election and let the people decide on what politicians they feel have betrayed them in the referendum. This is no longer about the referendum because a vote was taken and the majority of people had spoken and chose to leave it is about politicians who do not keep their promises to the people they serve.<br /><br />Can anyone say if they behaved like this lot they would have their job for long, I don‚Äôt think so.

Comment18	You&#39;ve been Bercow&#39;d!
Comment19	The man has a &quot;bollox to brexit&quot;  sticker on his car. Of course he&#39;s impartial. He&#39;ll be first against the wall, with comrade corbyn along side him. &quot;all are cleansed by the fires of revolution&quot;.
Comment20	What a dick head you are bercock

Comment34	Hear, hear !!!
Comment35	THEY  ALL ACT WORSE THAN KIDS IN THE  PLAY  GROUND!
Comment36	Bercow is a Remoaner and not impartial as is required and expected as the Speaker of the House.
Comment37	It&#39;s not rocket science to work out what Berkows doing and where he is trying to direct this especially since EU chief David Sassoli let slip about their secret meeting and how he and Berkow shared the same Interests over Brexit. Just to remind you Sassoli has said that he wants a second referendum which is the usual modus operandi of the EU who never accepts a democratic first result that goes against their own agenda.
Comment 37.1	Hello fellows
Comment38	So parliament shouldn&#39;t have to consider the same thing &#39; in substance&#39; twice, but the People, who in &#39;theory&#39; apparently, elect them, should be forced to? I&#39;ve never heard such elitism in my life.
Comment39	The utter shamelessness. In any other country such a biased speaker would have been sacked long ago. Not in the UK.
Comment 39.1	At least  he is working out he&#39;s notice
Comment40	so deluded and out of touch with the public and reality these people!! they saying cant read 115 pages in 3 days??????? could read it in an hour!! and they all on bbc saying oh it bad deal, bad for workers blah blah, then when asked if read bill they havn&#39;t???? so what is there knowledge based on? what someone else has told them?? if our politicians can&#39;t read and discuss a 115 page bill in 3 days they need changing!!! just remainers doing all can as usual to undermine the vote and the intelligence of the british public!! 3 votes to leave!!! 3 years they have had!! useless the lot should be tried for treason and being undemocratic in ignoring the vote of the people as they promised
Comment41	Disorderly and repetitive, eh? They said they don&#39;t want disorderly exit from EU but brand the attempt at doing the discussion as disorderly. Words salad, Mr. Speaker, cannot hide the clear distinction of what your priority is and what isn&#39;t.
Comment42	This is the worst parliament in british history it needs to be got rid of with a ge ! Scumbags all of them , letwin , bercow , grieve , sourberry they will all pay one day !
Comment43	Get the speaker out! Hes all for staying
Comment44	Wheres guy fawkes when you need him
Comment45	little pleb
Comment46	They cant vote twice on this yet they wont another vote on brexit bunch of snakes.
Comment47	Wow... the Parliament in the UK is even more corrupt than the Democrats in Congress in the US.  Who <i>is</i> this clown &quot;Bercow&quot;?  I thought the <i>people</i> decided to leave the EU.  <i>Those</i> circumstances haven&#39;t changed, either.  So why are there so many imbeciles in Parliament demanding another vote on THAT?!  Shouldn&#39;t <i>that</i> be rejected on the grounds that it would be &quot;repetitive and disorderly&quot; to do so?  Hasn&#39;t Parliament been diddling itself for the past 4 or 5 <i>years</i> about Brexit?  Aren&#39;t you concerned about the use of your time when it comes to doing the will of the people for whom you serve??  Smh...
Comment48	Who gives a fuck just leave the eu for god sake
Comment49	Mr Bercow, you have the dignity and courage both (and knowledge of legal and just procedures) even more than a big percentage of honorable members, to put it in some way in some specific cases, of the house; and principally do not suffer the pressure of overwhelming &quot;subjects&quot; that want to &quot;rolling on everything&quot; to lead the situation and seen their planes &quot;go ahead&quot;, does not care the &quot;way&quot; and the &quot;how&quot; its happens, in any case will be the people through more taxes or from the Government coffers those that will must to pay for leave Europe, with or without the deal; this subjects only think in their business, not interested in the money UK would been loose for do not have arrived to get a deal with the EU at the end of this way. And I am not talking about who got the right about Brexit, to remain, or to leave. This arrogant &quot;subjects&quot; will not have problem about how much money will go throw it away, this &quot;subjects&quot; that said to have the better level of &quot;wellness&quot; created under their governs for the folks of this Country...damn!!!!!<br /><br />There are a great amount of people that do not have money to pay the rent, students that family have to make miracles to send them to study, others without home, to do not talk about of those that do not have a work, and elderly people that have miserable retirements... some &quot;arrogant&quot; subjects from the House, do not merit to be where they are. They have had three years to get a deal, and the assigned for that...had FAILED. <br /><br />Will appoint their failure to those that have been not assigned to Govern?
Comment50	I think Boris is doing his best and bercow needs to piss off
Comment51	David Cameron created this mess<br /><br />Can we start a petition to have him hung?
Comment 51.1	@Peter Incompetent? Hes busting his ass to deliver on the democratic vote , despite efforts from all sides to stop him. Hes a true hero of the people, 10 times the man Corbyn is, and as for previous labour leaders don&#39;t get me started. Bring on an election and put it to the test. Oh wait a minute, labour are refusing to let democracy take its course... you can always rely on them. I&#39;d be livid if I was a labour leave voter....
Comment 51.2	@Chrisd&#39;stard no I literally mean let&#39;s hang him...<br /><br />He was incompetent, just like Boris Johnson is now... Along with all the other Tory leaders.<br /><br />Let&#39;s turf them all out and put Labour back in charge. It&#39;s our only hope......
Comment 51.3	Surely you don&#39;t resent  Cameron  for giving the people the chance to have a say? Unless <br />a)  you think the people are too stupid make a decision.<br />b) you don&#39;t like the outcome of thei vote.<br />If we&#39;d been given the vote 10 or 20 years ago, we would have been left long ago and reaping the benefits of being free of EU regulations.. but there&#39;s no way the likes of Blair would have given ordinary people a voice.
Comment 51.4	Peter. Do you mean hanged?
Comment52	Hello fellows
Comment53	Guys I‚Äôm so confused... <b>curls hair in finger</b>
Comment54	What a dull little man
Comment55	All i can say is, &quot;Bercow is out of ooorrrderrrrrrrrrrrrr&quot;
Comment56	Even if we come up with a deal that is satisfactory to every single person in the country and the house of commons , bercow will still block it because he doesn&#39;t want to leave the EU, He&#39;s supposed to be impartial but its its plain to see that he Isn&#39;t , the scumbag
Comment57	MPs are ruining this country
Comment58	GET IT DONE !  IT&#39;S A PEOPLE&#39;S VOTE. NOT THAT OF A FEW EXTREMISTS !

Comment60	When ever I see this pompous man sitting in that chair, I&#39;m reminded of a meal mother used to make...... Toad in the Hole!!
Comment61	you all voted to get out right  &amp; the ones that wanted out won right  so tell me why you fools still in going through this bs go  or stay but you voted to go so GO sick of this shit on tv
Comment62	Frick
Comment63	Democracy hahahahahahahahahahahaha
Comment64	Berkowitz (John Bercow&#39;s real name) proves why it is imperitave that jews are not appointed to political positions outside of israhell. They are simply not to be trusted. There is a good reason that jews have been expelled from over 200 countries over the past two centuries, and Berkowitz high-lights the reasons.
Comment65	Ordaaaaaaaaaaa!
Comment66	How refreshing to hear a coherent and forceful analysis coming from a politician. He&#39;s a shining example of how leaders should conduct themselves. He is skillfully exposing the rather lame and repeated attempts by Brexiteers to get one past him and they don&#39;t like it. He is calling them on their b.s.<br /><br />Keep strong, Bercow!
Comment 66.1	You couldn&#39;t have got it more confused if you tried. HE is the dishonourable weasel who has brought shame on the House and his position. He should walk away in shame...
Comment67	Sack the speaker
Comment68	What a twist little guy this Bercow is well I believe in Karma hopefully he will get his day.
Comment69	On Monday the same hour at the same house. From the UK innocent deportee in Ghana Mr Mamadou Bendaloue. 31/10/19 no deal or deal
Comment70	For fucks sake, Putin mightaswell invade us right now, no balls whatsoever.
Comment71	TLDR.... The UK voted to leave the EU, the majority of the politicians in the houses of commons want to remain in the EU and are sabotaging any effort to leave. And are also blocking a general election where the remain politicians would be voted out...
Comment72	Brexit, season 3 episode 25 is proving to be just as boring as the last. Our PM John Bercow, ... sorry Boris Johnson has yet another defeat - who saw that coming. John Bercow is operating his decision tree at maximum. Is against Brexit? Yes... Is for or trying to accomplish something? No
Comment73	The whole lot of these so called politicians should be sacked, this must be costing us, the tax payers millions if not billions of pounds. This lot couldn&#39;t organise a &#39;party&#39; in a brewery
Comment74	Bercow is a evil cock
Comment75	Bercow is totally representative of a divided Britain . Just under half the country love him and just over half the country would spit on his grave....bit like Margaret Thatcher really. Oh well perhaps we are long overdue for a civil war just to spice up our history.
Comment76	There are two issues: valid &amp; unsound
Comment77	Nobody in this parliament are even considered as &quot;honourable&quot; or &quot;respectful&quot;<br /><br />How they are treating this is beyond disappointing and disrespectful not to mention childish.<br /><br />Whatever they do will affect us all but they treat it all as a joke because who cares... They get paid alot for doing nothing apart from defending their jobs and income
Comment78	Brexit is a project of the English upper class. He should be the lever to eliminate EU influences like EU labor law, which endangers the continued disadvantage of the middle and lower class.<br />But in England it‚Äôs so easy for the upper class to enforce their interests of self-enrichment almost resistance free. You have to hold a Union Jack in the face of the man in the street, singing ‚ÄúGod save the ‚Ä¶‚Äù and name an exterritorial enemy. But not only the EU labor law etc. disturbing the enrichment also a growing positive identification of the younger English generations with the EU cause that. The simple national manipulation gets no longer entangled. <br />Unfortunately it‚Äôs not applicable for the older generations. The leaders of Labour Party have to position clearly against Brexit. But they are caged in the well trained old reflexes. Brexit sounds so good and so English. So that the profiteers can smile relaxed. No matter how stupid Boris Johnson gets, he‚Äôll assert their and his interests, except the youth takes over the interpretational sovereignty (as in case of climate). This should lead to a change of leadership in the Labour Party. Than remains and social equity gets a real chance.
Comment79	Bercow has been bunged by his masters.
Comment80	Orderrrrrrrrrrrrr
Comment81	An obnoxious and disingenuous man.
Comment82	This deal or the new deal do we the &quot;People&quot; actually know what it is !
Comment83	News you would like to here  &quot;John Bercow choked on his own ego today&quot; ! üê∏ üòÇ What an ‚öì
Comment84	What &quot; legal experts &quot; and what conventions. Speaker Bercow is a far more intelligent person than you can ever aspire to be, troll.
Comment85	Who could want Bercow&#39;s job! Credit to him.
Comment86	I am so bored of Brexit. It feels like we are never going to leave. üëç
Comment87	Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, I welcome you to the death of democracy in the UK...
Comment 87.1	No I disagree, 3 years ago society in the UK voted to level the European union. This however has not been carried out by parliament
Comment 87.2	Well, justice died over 100 years ago - so perhaps democracy&#39;s death is a bit overdue ?
Comment88	Funny but when Theresa May wanted to put the same deal forward 3 times she was able to. When parliament wanted to force through the Benn and Letwin bills in double quick time they were allowed to.  This is political game playing to undo Brexit, nothing more.
Comment89	Bercow is paid by the EU DiCTATORSHIP ...  FACT
Comment90	Since when did Bercow become the PM ???
Comment91	Bercow for PM !!!! üòÅ

Comment94	I hope his misses is out on the pull....AGAIN
Comment95	Bercow should be jailed along with all remainer MP&#39;s whose constituencies voted leave.
Comment96	Have you tried turning the EU off and back on again?
Comment 96.1	That&#39;s almost the most sensible thing I&#39;ve head tonight. I&#39;m just not sure about the ...and back on again bit.
Comment97	How about we just stay in the EU.
Comment 97.1	How about we don&#39;t.

Comment107	This entitled little runt needs to be dispatched
Comment108	Ordah! Brexit must be delivered. Said Bercow never.
Comment109	Never have we had a speaker who loves the limelight and talking so very much. All the proper procedure in the world cant stop anyone from realising almost immediately that he is completely inept
Comment110	God forbid if we hung dishonourable MPs and people in the establishment... <br />I know full well everyone who sits in the commons wouldnt turn up for work the day after üòí<br />Bercuck is the worst of them all.. <br />Impartial my arse!<br />Get him out, and completely reconfigure the establishment from the ground up including everyone in it.

Comment155	Bercow deserves to be publicly lynched!
Comment 155.1	David Floren no I meant hanged in public!  He is a treasonous ass; lap dog of the evil globalists.
Comment 155.2	You mean &quot; lauded&quot;.  Must have been autocorrect that messed you up.
Comment156	John Bercow continues to be the voice of reason
Comment157	what a prick
Comment158	The UK Houses of Parliament is subservient¬† to the European parliament, the real seat of power. Bercow and his fellow traitors are mere henchman
Comment 158.1	&quot;Subservient&quot; yeah, thanks to John Major who signed the so-called Maastricht Treaty no questions asked, Blair and the so-called Lisbon Treaty, although he connivingly, typical Blair, got someone else to sign it, no referendum or public consolation catapulting the country into the start of a EU superstate where Britain will become a parish council of the EU.
Comment 158.2	All parents, umpires, referees, and judges throughout the UK are all henchmen (and henchwomen).<br /><br />There, I&#39;ve paraphrased the not-so-right-honorable gentleman.
Comment159	Brexit didn&#39;t people vote for it so What&#39;s the problem no deal smh just bounce out
Comment 159.1	America does it without being in the EU so can England Simpleton
Comment 159.2	Simpleton. Trade.
Comment160	Traitors!
Comment161	Blah, blah, blah. Yadda, yadda, yadda.<br />No deal Brexit<br />Blah, blah, blah...<br /><br />Just get on with it already.
Comment162	Good to see the Speaker is not a puppet of the Executive, as happens in other Parliaments.  Bercow is a character of course;  from Australia, I enjoyed his verbal grenades and obsequiously polite punch-ups.

Comment165	Speaker Bercow brilliant again.
Comment166	Bercow has 10 days to get his unruly ducks in line.
Comment167	Oh! The Alarming Inevitability of it All!<br />As The Brick Wall approacheth, Brit MoP&#39;s delay debating this arrangement. Boris Johnson pushes the throttle forward. I eagerly await Farage&#39;s assuming Control.
Comment168	Bercuck is the boss level cuck. You have to fight him once you‚Äôve defeated all his cuck minions.
Comment169	No means No.<br /><br />But Conservatives mean hypocracy means hypocracy. They SAY they are against a second vote in the light of greater knowledge of the matter up for decision, but only if they get the answer they want. Just as Nigel Farnge was not going to acceopt a 52 - 48 vote AGAINST Brexit, but insists that a 52 - 48 vote FOR an undefined Brexit is FINAL.<br /><br />btw Nige, Putin sends his love and kisses, the check is in the mail.

Comment174	I don‚Äôt understand.   !   Complicated !
Comment175	Don&#39;t mess with a guy with intellect, a sharp wit and with both hands able to swing 17th Century Parliamentary procedure like an axe.  Greetings from Canada.  We&#39;re counting our vote tonight.
Comment 175.1	@John Quimby you have voted for national suicide ! Trudeau is an absolute idiot with his compelled speech etc good luck canada you are going to need it, a terrible result  what is wrong with canadians ?
Comment 175.2	It turns out Andrew Sheer couldn&#39;t win what should have been a walk off for the Tories.  And Trudeau lost the most ground - not to the right - but to the left.  Another weak run to the center gave us a minority liberal government.  Which is about as satisfying as yesterday&#39;s cold oatmeal.
Comment 175.3	And what did Canada do? They have voted for that idiot libtard Trudeau again ! You lot are succours for punishment!
Comment176	Majority vote leave.<br />Have a send vote in parliament for this deal.<br />All denied so to hell with it no deal leave the EU.<br />The EU has to let us go if extension is granted well you can have your own opinions.
Comment177	Stephanie Tihanyl ( a good English name that) what do you think about my &quot;reasoning&quot; now ? and how about that insightfulness ,not bad for a blind man ,
Comment178	The vast majority (though, not all) of UK constituents who voted in a &#39;People&#39;s Vote&#39;, otherwise known as a referendum, voted to for Brexit.  Unfortunately, a large number, possibly a majority, of MPs wish to remain in the EU, despite what the majority constituents voted for.  This is just another example of Parlament trying to delaying leaving the EU for as long as they can, in defiance of the &#39;People&#39;s Vote&#39;.  Since joining the EU (or, what was then the EEC) a whole new generation of citizens has grown up and is eligible to vote.  If the EU remainers wish to hold another referendum in another generation, by all means.  However, the EU remainers don&#39;t get to say &quot;let&#39;s keep voting until we remain!&quot;, or to have a &#39;best out of 3&#39; - voted to leave in the first referendum, so have a 2nd and maybe vote to remain, so then have a 3rd referendum.  You can guarantee that remainers just want a 2nd &#39;People&#39;s Vote&#39; and that if they won they would say &quot;no more voting, we&#39;ve won!&quot;
Comment179	British people are so chill and uptight at the exact same time...&amp; it blows my friggin mind
Comment180	Despicable  Berkow needs a rope around his neck.   His supporters are all of his dangerous cabal.   He could never have been voted Speaker of the House if his rich, powerful, minority Zionist  cabal did not fight very hard to promote him.   Brexit strikes a major blow against corrupt Berkow&#39;s ilk evil Global New world order<br /> .
Comment181	Is it not time now for someone to table a motion of<br />no-confidence in the speaker?¬† I know that, in the past, there was not much<br />point in this as there was a Remainer majority who would keep him in the chair<br />because of the help he was giving them, but now that there appears to be a<br />small majority (c320 MPs) who want to pass the deal, there could be a similar<br />majority to pass a motion of no-confidence in him, as they know that Bercow<br />will do all he can to prevent the deal passing &amp; to thwart Brexit.¬†<br />The effect of such a vote would be to force the speaker either to stand down<br />or, at least, to vacate the chair during debates on Brexit, &amp; allow those<br />debates to be chaired by one of the deputy speakers (Laing or Hoyle) who have<br />not shown any bias on this issue, &amp; who have criticised Bercow for his<br />manifest bias.¬† If they don&#39;t do this, there is no chance that the deal<br />will pass.
Comment182	Glad your leaving Bercow.
Comment183	John Hitler shows his bias and tries to genuflect the truth of the importance of respecting democratic principles and the BREXIT VOTE OF THE PEOPLE.<br /><br />If this sham opposition is allowed to continue then the COMMUNIST YELLOW HORDE have already taken the United Kingdom which used to be GREAT BRITAIN.<br /><br />BREXIT. NO SURRENDER.
Comment184	you pommys are a weird bunch, you must brexit, stop fighting it you pack of unintelligent morons
Comment185	Bloody hell damn he wacked that BDE
Comment186	The Tories are crying foul because they didn&#39;t get their way, like the spoiled brats they really are.  Bercow is at least being consistent in not allowing the debate to be repeated (esp so soon after the 1st debate) as he did with Theresa May&#39;s deal when she tried to have hers debated again. As those same politicians are seeking to deny voters a 2nd say on the outcome of negotiations, why should Tories be allowed to debate the new withdrawal agreement again?
Comment187	I‚ÄôM DISCUSTARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Comment188	False flag coming soon im sure of it! They need a distraction from all the eyes on them rite now
Comment189	The sooner this little rat remainer Bercow is gone the better. This rat is a Traitor ...
Comment 189.1	I agree; the little speaker.......
Comment190	Make Boris great again and vote for his fantastic deal he have for Northern Ireland
Comment191	Well I am celebrating the demise of Bercow  who will go down in history as the most biased speaker for parliament in history. In the context of this specific ruling he is correct but he has been a truly appalling speaker. It won&#39;t be at all difficult for his successor to improve on his standards.. The most enjoyable part will be that he will still live to see in his lifetime a True BREXIT achieved. The reality is the longer Parliament objects and resists the more the nation grow against them, so the outcome is inevitable. May the pigs in our parliamentary trough with lipstick continue....as they clearly have no other ability or aptitude to represent or put the majority of their nation first. In the next manifesto&#39;s from all these MP&#39;s nobody will be interested in their policies because they know they will be ignored or changed. So we will vote for democracy and nothing less. The rest is now irrelevant... because all these MP&#39;s are untrustworthy.
Comment 191.1	SHUT UP YOU HUNT
Comment192	that had to be the most entertaining and gentlemanly flogging of unruly prats I have ever witnessed (secondhand on ytube). kudos Speaker Bercow. I wish we had a parliamentarian of your caliber here in the States.
Comment193	10 days to go folks then party time with ones family .Its been a drag¬†and the deniers are panicking as they consider their failure to grasp the democracy that was won by better folks who have seen life and faced it full on as opposed to the weak remainers.
Comment194	Bercow is a shithouse
Comment195	GIVE THE DAMN QUEEN THE COMMAND OVER THIS MESS
Comment 195.1	Please don&#39;t refer to my Queen as The Damn Queen.
Comment 195.2	@Thomas Grey Precisely
Comment 195.3	The United Kingdom sidestepped an eventuality like the French Revolution precisely because they addressed your very suggestion..
Comment196	Bercow who‚Äôs fiddling your lady
Comment197	Many politicians haunting the corridors of power in the UK are born and bred sh..s.During the debates surrounding our leaving the EU many of them have demonstrated the worst behaviour that has lead to a new insult word (politician).Rather than using the F word if one wants impact then go for the P word.Confidence in those who Hold power has waned and little respect is forwarded to those who have consistently used their positions to enhance their own particular needs.Those very miscreants are now listed by the electorate as persona non grata and will be weeded out like so many nettles.
Comment198	Trouble ahead.
Comment199	Making a long story short, procrastination! Hard Brexit now!
Comment200	This Pratt has got to go
Comment201	Legend in it&#39;s finest form
Comment202	The prime Minister is pro Brexit (Boris Johnson ....and so Therea May) , the People are pro Brexit. BUT the parliament is against it.¬†Patt Situation like in a chess game. A new referendum or a new governement.....? British People should know what Party is standing what for.
Comment203	You have sat too long for any good you have been doing lately ... Depart, I say; and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!

Comment210	This little man has done so much damage to democracy
Comment211	Weather we voted remain or leave this behaviour after 3 years STINKS. The blabbing bluster and biased of this man is there for all to see he&#39;s trying to hide behind his robes. All of you are killing this country with this behaviour, we need an election and we need to leave the EU on the 31st all of this is making us a laughing stock!
Comment212	Brexiteer MPs are using intimidation and bullying to get round the law and get things done their way regardless of the law.
Comment 212.1	Would that be the law that these traitors change before they break it?
Comment213	Johnson knew Bercow would not allow the vote to go ahead, he knows the procedures. He attempted it so he could rile up the hardcore Brexiteers when Bercow quite rightly didn&#39;t allow it to go ahead.
Comment214	Great news. Let&#39;s sort out the legislature and then the deal . The cons are a total disgrace
Comment215	BBC donnt enlighten us please ,when close eyes I see Red stains and hear beeping
Comment216	The EU should just let go.  No deal.  No extension.  Clean break.
Comment217	Ahhh this odor again ,Brexit means Brrrexit ,both mean nothing but a nasty false flag show for public and following up on illegitimate trade interests of UK establishment ,
Comment218	It doesn&#39;t matter, we are leaving on WTO terms at the end of this month.  Nothing can prevent that now.
Comment219	What a hero! Doesn&#39;t bend to power.
Comment220	In substance Mr Bercow.. you are an absolute puppet..
Comment221	Time for the army to take over sort these twits out.
Comment222	This horrible fellow really annoys me. He has too much power.
Comment223	There is nothing Honourable about them, dishonourable is more like it.
Comment 223.1	@man0z I know what you mean, I&#39;ve said the same thing to an anti peado community and my overwhelming response was my comments were dangerous ones üôÑ and I used their response here to see what you&#39;d say.. so yeah I agree with you.
Comment 223.2	Is there a resin the bbc is totally ignoring the ep stein case?? What about Prince An drew?? Royal pea do? Why isn&#39;t the bbc covering this?? Are you still covering up for pea dos like you did in the days of Jimmy sa vile?<br />BBC = pea do protection
Comment 223.3	if you want to see real dishonor just look across the pond. it&#39;s a real shit storm over here :(
Comment 223.4	@man0z You just can&#39;t trust Boris like you could that nice Tony Blair.
Comment 223.5	@Andy Gumb they not human, they are responsible for far more murder and execution then I would be since you are implying that I want to &quot;execute&quot; them
Comment224	He should be arrested.
Comment 224.1	Treason, also he shouldn&#39;t take sides he&#39;s the Speaker of the House. He should not take sides.
Comment225	Marriage problems are said to have a devastating effect on peoples sanity.
Comment226	Jeez, he loves the sound of his own voice.
Comment227	<b>Only Oliver Letwin&#39;s deliberate spoiler amendment was voted through. The government did not seek a vote on the Leave Deal Bill so what you now have is an amendment to a bill which, in parliamentary terms,  does not exist. Well done Mr Bercow, you have managed to once more block the effort to bring the will of the people to leave the EU to fruition. But in satisfying your own selfish preferences you have only succeeded in making it clear to us all just how treacherous and disloyal you really are. But despite you and others of your kind the will of the people WILL be fulfilled and we WILL, ultimately, leave the EU. By hook or by crook, it WILL be done!</b>
Comment228	To all you people who don¬¥t understand rules and laws. that is like 80% of the youtube commentators.<br />Bercow just reinforced the rule and law. that a same proposition voted down earlier can¬¥t be represented for another vote.<br />So in simple people wording. you can¬¥t keep on proposing the NO TAX AT ALL Act a zillion times till it passes.
Comment 228.1	@mogznwaz May deal was amended 3 times. she had to work hard running forth and back between Europe and UK , using her charm offensive to get a deal that kept UK together.<br /><br /><br />Bojo deal just sacrificed Northern Ireland. <br />How is that getting more control of your country. you can look it up.
Comment 228.2	Yet Theresa May&#39;s deal was put forward 3 times with no discernible change.......
Comment 228.3	@Helene Papageorge You did he had to explain his reason why he based his decision on as the speaker of the house, which suppose to be impartial to both parties. <br />That last part we can always take into question cause the way human work.<br />But at least in this case he explained himself very clearly.<br />All according to rules and law.
Comment 228.4	I agree. I thought he was stating that there are no remarkable differences in topics or other between Sat. session &amp; debate from Monday&#39;s session but I needed to hear this 2x+. He also gave 2 historic precedents [?] and an amendment to back his decision but also informed/directed his decision. Bercow is NOT blocking anything. He is just doing what his portfolio demands of him. Was he a Constitutional Solicitor/Barrister?? In this way he is behaving more of an adjudicator. So, if he is being accused of blocking its only because the Brexiteer faction &amp; Boris Johnson, did NOT get the decision they wanted from him. Did I even get close to understanding this?? If so I will have considered myself a pretty sophisticated  New Yorker!!
Comment229	I&#39;m really rather enjoying this. üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
Comment230	He said all of that with a stupid grin on his face, makes me sick
Comment231	The UK is supposed to be a democratic country, why then can one Buffon override the democratic wishes of the country? John Bercow acts like he presides over this country just as a dictator. True democracy will only return after he has gone at the end of this month... Enough Mr. Bercow, enough!
Comment232	I am from Australia.<br />I must say this Brexit deal is high drama.
Comment 232.1	@Adi MateI didn&#39;t loot any thing.<br /><br />The Mughals would say India stole Islamic lands.<br />How many Muslims have been killed during rioting in the last 40 years.<br />What about the Khalistan movement in the Punjab?<br />ULFA?<br />Najaland?<br />Etc etc etc...<br />See how this works?
Comment 232.2	@Adi Mate Still burning brides over there or is that one of the many improvements you should thank the British for?
Comment 232.3	@Household Dog in India alone btw can&#39;t talk about the rest of the world.
Comment 232.4	@Household Dog when you looted resources which were in today worth 45 trillion usd.
Comment 232.5	SGW a republic ü§£üòÇü§£. That‚Äôs exactly why many ‚Äòawake‚Äô around the world are standing up, and others are blinkered.
Comment233	I&#39;ve got a really nasty feeling that by the time this farce is over, Assange will be in Guantanamo and - just like that - the future of the UK will have been decided by a majority of 2%. We&#39;ll then need another referendum to work out why we needed a referendum in the first place. You&#39;re brainwashed if you think anything will happen here which isn&#39;t precisely in line with current US foreign policy.
Comment234	Gotta love how many people are commenting about TLDR News...on a BBC News video...to EXPLAIN the BBC News video. Maybe the BBC should hire TLDR.

Comment 238.1	@Paul HIlditch and you&#39;re an idiot

Comment240	So we are not leaving by the end of October???<br />FFS this has been going on for years. . . . Just get it done young children.  . .<br /><br />What a bunch of amateurs (edited)
Comment241	Amendments had been made.  Therefore, it is not the same, so it should have been allowed.  Bercow enjoys his job  too much that he thinks its a fun game whilst he forgets that there are peoples lives on hold and our country harmed with its reputation in tatters.  The Prime Minister is right, we need to just get on and get Brexit done.  There are times when Bercow&#39;s hands may be tied, but often he is driven on by the dishournarable, undemocratic parliament and seems to sway towards those whom wish to delay.  Time for a new Speaker and Parliament!
Comment242	I‚Äôm going to miss him
Comment 242.1	.....me too, like a bad smell!!
Comment 242.2	Don&#39;t worry he&#39;ll hang around <br />Can&#39;t stand the man
Comment243	What a treacherous trickster ! There  needs to be a inquiry into his self serving behavior?
Comment 243.1	He&#39;s clearly.self serving.and a remainer like yourself?
Comment 243.2	In which way, shape, or form is John Bercow supposed to be self-serving? What would that even mean in his case? He made a ruling in line with existing rules, in a manner consistent with how he himself had applied them in the past, and he presented and evaluated every potential argument that went into that ruling. How could he be any more objective than that?
Comment244	VERY GOOD YOU STOP BREXIT  WE LOVE THAT
Comment245	Confusion of the highest order
Comment246	That was expected. No parliament can have same vote brought again and again or it would get halted on vote-nope-vote-nope wheel forever.
Comment247	Let‚Äôs let Bercow the Bias keep blocking and delaying, after all it only costs us ¬£1billion a month.
Comment 247.1	They&#39;ll be asking us for money for Children in Need soon aswell, no wonder they are starving at a billion a month
Comment248	bercow should be remove he just make name for him self
Comment 248.1	I hope he has secured a good provision for his retirement, after all, he will find no job in this country anymore.
Comment249	Now I need to take some English classes first to understand him...
Comment 249.1	I use my computer dictionary.
Comment250	This man should be dragged out put in stocks so we can all throw rotten eggs at him because that&#39;s all he is rotten to the core
Comment251	bully bercow believes he‚Äôs the single most important person in parliament!
Comment252	Corrupt and partial little b@st@rd, this Berk. C&#39;mon Boris, end this farsical debacle and leave without a deal on deadline date. I&#39;ve never seen anything like this... An impotent government in the hands of the Speaker.
Comment253	Corrupt, lying traitor...he&#39;d fit in well at the BBC...cancel your tv licence
Comment 253.1	Good lad.  I will when I find out what one is.
Comment254	John Bercow should be made Prime Minister, in an interim Government, until Article 50 is revoked.
Comment255	Nevermind only 10 more days of this biased speaker
Comment256	Long live democracy.
Comment257	This is the longest intro before the Game of Thrones opening credits ever.
Comment258	I thought there had been no meaningful vote last Saturday after the Letwin amendment had been passed. Or did it take place after all?
Comment 258.1	There was a vote in an amendment that clarifies the House&#39;s stance on the deal: the House will not support any deal that has no implementing legislation. Since this deal has none, the House could not vote for it.
Comment 258.2	No it did not, I watched it all day  so not sure wth is going on
Comment259	Who are those idiots that were laughing? Don‚Äôt they understand the speaker of the house was explaining correct procedure and why this prescribes a second vote to not be allowed?<br /><br />This is not a partisan jab at the government. And those idiots laughing may be happy to see Boris get the lid on his nose again, but by laughing just risk the perception of partiality, which only undermines their case
Comment260	This man should be thrown in prison
Comment 260.1	Really - for protecting sanity and preventing Johnson from blindsiding everyone to force through a catastrophic and damaging &#39;excellent deal&#39;..... i don&#39;t think so!
Comment261	Just following the rules. Poor Bercow getting the blame
Comment 261.1	the problem is Bercow has never followed the rules...a speaker should be unbiased on all matters in the house. Yet he has blatantly tried single handidly to destroy the will of the British people
Comment 261.2	I&#39;m watching from the U.S. but it seems to me like many of the people who support Brexit and the UK&#39;s right to self determination on the UK&#39;s own terms, using the UK&#39;s own system, are quick to criticize decisions like this that are explicitly based on parliamentary precedent. Like do you want your government to be dictated by the laws of Britain or not?
Comment 261.3	Mcboggy  Poor Bercow&#39;s getting the blame!!!!  don&#39;t feel sorry for him he probably has<br />a bag of Euro&#39;s stashed away in some secret place.  he should be investigated.
Comment 261.4	Mcboggy too bad so many idiots aren‚Äôt aware of their own Parliamentary rules
Comment262	I HATE BERCOW

Comment266	John Bercow - Subverter of British democracy .
Comment267	Bercow is a traitor, he should be in the tower of london.
Comment 267.1	@Infernal460 democracy of the people is a reflection of the MPs representing us in parliament, not just a one-off binary referendum with no two-thirds majority and no options as to type of brexit.
Comment 267.2	@Ke St you should be in the tower of london for being retarded.
Comment 267.3	Ke St <br />The UK is not a democracy, it‚Äôs a constitutional monarchy, idiot.
Comment 267.4	@ab8jeh I prefer democracy of the people that should be area of primacy.
Comment 267.5	Parliamentary democracy, not Tory dictatorship. You&#39;ll get your brexit, you can blame this on Theresa May dithering for 3 years.
Comment268	This is a joke:)
Comment269	Bercow the traitor needs sacking !!!
Comment270	Still doing every SLIMY thing they can but 10 days to go and the LOSERS are RATTLING, no doubt they will CRY LAW as often as they can until EXIT DAY
Comment 270.1	@wiamoaw Yeah and 16 million voted to remain
Comment 270.2	nio england still waiting for an answer mate. If you can‚Äôt answer two simple questions then your whole platform is fucked.
Comment 270.3	@nio england The German people voted for Hitler... I rest my case.
Comment 270.4	nio england platitudes = speaking in general ideas with no substance.<br /><br />You‚Äôve still actually said fuck all by the way. Just ‚ÄúWe must leave!‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be one of the greatest countries on earth!‚Äù<br />That‚Äôs basically meaningless. <br /><br />So again..<br />1. How will your life be better after leaving the EU?<br /><br />2. What will you be able to do after leaving the EU that you can‚Äôt do now?
Comment 270.5	@Paul Thomas You asked why we should leave EU, so i said why, i dont know what a platitude is, i gotta say 1st ive lived/worked in Holland ( part of EU ) i like Holland, im aware it would be more difficult to do when we have left EU but i dont care. when one assess&#39;s a situation one must weigh and balance all aspects and it is this that leads to what i explained earlier, that on balance we have to leave the EU and its not as if we wont become one the best nations on earth once we have left, only a weak crybaby ( LOSER ) would try to dispute
Comment271	Isnt it about time Bercow went
Comment 271.1	He is resigning at the end of the month.
Comment272	What a statement. The most eloquent way to tell the government to fuck off for 7 minutes straight.
Comment273	Typical , historical speech, interrupted by Tories with no respect for anyone or anything but their money
Comment 273.1	historical speech / that goes against a democratic vote
Comment274	A speaker in the houses of parliament are supposed to be impartial and not rule on the Brexit bias this is another example of how a supposed democracy works
Comment 274.1	He is impartial,  its clear as day
Comment275	What a comedy and what arrogance. The UK comprises so many wonderful cultures, including those of the island itself. Such a pity the &quot;Brits&quot; have it so often. Come on, UK, wakey wakey, Boris is NOT the answer, too many lies, too much self-aggrandisment and altogether too much arrogance.
Comment276	In Boris we trust. Scotland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø
Comment277	Bercow is not having any of Boris&#39;s BS. Well done.
Comment278	By the time Berkow had completed his pompous, rambling pontification they could have had the ridiculous debate three times over!<br />This idiot just loves the sound of his own voice. No wonder we‚Äôre three years in with no practical progress.<br />Sack em all!
Comment279	Bercow will be missed. Very tempered and fair imo
Comment280	Help! Help! I&#39;m being repressed! Witness the violence inherent in the system! Is this a Monty Python skit?ü§£
Comment281	Did Barcow work for PG Tips before this.....
Comment282	Bercow must resign. He is now abusing his position and has let it go to his head. He is not impartial in his decisions and can therefore not hold this position any longer according to the law.
Comment283	hahaha, bercow just made a solid argument for the results of the referendum.<br /><br />get on with it already. no deal fuck &#39;em.
Comment284	Bollocks to Bercow
Comment285	Primitive word here ‚Äòattempt‚Äô üôÉ
Comment286	It really is time this horrible little man was got rid of, he should be strung up for treason. He alone is responsible for this huge mess in parliament, and there are many of us who would like to see him dangling on a rope or having his head knocked of on the scaffold. He must be the most hated man in britain at present, and history wont forgive him. A traitors end for a traitor.
Comment287	Robert Mugabe is laughing in his grave.
Comment288	ORDDDDDEEEEEEEEEEEER
Comment289	This pathetic speakership is a shame in the history of British democracy.
Comment290	As a lever I&#39;m not sure this shower of shite in any party are able to govern without the EU holding their hands. they are dictators for their own needs let&#39;s have an election the winner can then have a second vote if it pleases which still should be in or out no sculduggery then
Comment291	Bercow knows.
Comment 291.1	.....nothing......
Comment292	oh fuck off all you undemocratic remainers, Saturday was about the letwank amendment, when did the vote motion happen....it didnt.... so how does that make it lawful  for him not to allow happen on Monday.....simple, Bercow is biased and should be kicked out...Parliamentary protocol my arse!
Comment293	<b>With Remainers &quot;sleeping with the enemy&quot;, and Bercow having a fit of Sour Grapes about Johnson&#39;s Brexit deal and then Cutting off his own nose to spite his face, the UK Parliament has been</b><br /><b>turned into a complete farce, a laughing stock that has made most people around the world believe that British politicians are actually Lunatics who have taken over Parliament and are in the process</b><br /><b>of destroying British Democracy, something that the UK, once upon a time, was famous for = A Sensible, Strong, Stable democracy ,   BUT, NO MORE.

Comment294	Tories throwing their dummies out of the pram because they can&#39;t get their own way. Bring on the election and let us WIPE THEM OUT COMPLETELY!
Comment 294.1	Your&#39;e living in lala land, its the Liebor party that&#39;s going to be wiped out, just wait and see.
Comment 294.2	Do you really think that will happen. Did you ask the Tooth Fairy for a marxist government?
Comment295	Oh! What a surprise. Sod the electorate - parliament decides aka the remainers decide.
Comment 295.1	@Rick Martin <br />It&#39;s a pity it doesn&#39;t act like a Parliamentary Democracy. Remainer MPs have thrown so many spanners in the leave process that it&#39;s  going to be difficult to leave the EU.
Comment 295.2	There was nothing enacting with the referendum. And only if we were allowed to consider in or out now we know what it means
Comment 295.3	Get over it ;) This is all a result of &#39;brexit means brexit&#39; instead of 3 years ago deciding what type of brexit had a mandate. Tories are completely inept.
Comment 295.4	The UK is a Parliamentary Democracy. It is Parliament which is sovereign. Like it or not, that&#39;s what we have.
Comment296	Order order orderrrrrr
Comment297	At midnight tonight horrific new law allowing the unregulated killing of unborn babies comes into effect in Northern Ireland. <br /><br />Abortion law is a devolved matter. This radical change was foisted on the Northern Irish people by English, Scottish and Welsh MPs in just 17 minutes of debate in Westminster.<br /><br />Today some Northern Irish Unionists tried to take back control of OUR own laws from those Brits who are forcing the most extreme abortion law in Europe onto Northern Irish people.<br /><br />BUT SADLY Sinn F√©in preferred to let the English, Scots and Welsh MPs decide the fate of Irish children and refused to join their Unionist colleagues in taking back control of this law<br /><br />During the Troubles Sinn F√©in&#39;s hero Bobby Sands coined the phrase <br />&quot;Our revenge will be the laughter of our children&quot;<br /><br />Perhaps that should now read &quot;THEIR REVENGE WILL BE THE SLAUGHTER OF OUR UNBORN CHILDREN&quot; ?<br /><br />SHAME ON YOU SINN FEIN. <br />SHAME ON YOU WESTMINSTER.
Comment 297.1	Shame on you...
Comment298	Welcome to Brexitland.
Comment299	Just leave it walk away from EU 4th Reich go Boris
Comment 299.1	Marco you are a tool mate.
Comment 299.2	@Tom P it&#39;s the fourth one because that&#39;s the number after 3, you moron
Comment 299.3	@Richard McDonald What&#39;s the most common conation associated with that term... ?<br /><br />Previous comment mentioned it as the 4th Reich ...which  sorta references the 3rd one don&#39;t it? hur duh..
Comment 299.4	@Tom P I love how you think Reich is a nazi term, it&#39;s just German for realm or empire. Hence the nazi one being the third, the first being the holy Roman empire and the second being the German empire. So when people say fourth Reich it just means a new German empire.
Comment 299.5	@revelationreflection It&#39;s amazing how misinformed a huge number of British people are,  feelings over facts.<br /><br />Throwing around Nazi terminology like a bunch of children.
Comment300	How could you not love this guy, eloquence at its best!
Comment 300.1	I like him, but he is a treasonous little shit
Comment 300.2	@David Hudson You are just sour and bitter
Comment 300.3	Eloquence? Garbled obfuscation morelike.....pompous little man....
Comment301	Speaker Bercow is certainly an honorable man and leader. He has served with distinction for the people of the UK. Excellent job Sir.
Comment 301.1	Hear, hear.
Comment302	End this democracy go for monarchy absolute monarchy
Comment 302.1	It&#39;s certainly a tempting notion!
Comment 302.2	Lol, missing Game of Thrones are you, ha ha
Comment303	Remember remember the fifth of November springs to mind
Comment 303.1	@Alan But if he had succeeded he would have thought it more than worthwhile.
Comment 303.2	Worse than that. Hung till nearly dead then guts drawn out and burnt in front of him then cut into quarters. Really nasty way to go.
Comment 303.3	Didn&#39;t they hang Guy Fawkes? Lol
Comment304	W‚öìÔ∏è
Comment305	Remain: It&#39;s been 3 years since the referendum, we should have another vote to see if people have changed their minds or understand it more now.<br />Brexit: What? How dare you! No 2nd votes just because you don&#39;t like the way the first vote went, not even years later!<br />Also Brexit: I don&#39;t like how that vote went 48 hours ago, we need to have another vote on that same matter again until things go the way I want.
Comment 305.1	"ualdayan<br />Implement the fist election result before you have another."
Comment306	In less than 100 years going from a global super power to this. Britain has become the joke of the world.
Comment 306.1	@Joachim Petersen Sanctions and military power on any one? I dont think so, maybe sanctions works partially on Russia, but on Kina US dont even have the power to sanction with out it hurting itself equally or more. Kina is becoming what Soviet Union never was a military and economical superpower.
Comment 306.2	If we get any fatter we might be like you yanks
Comment 306.3	@Rick Martin Yea they&#39;re only like the biggest power in the world, putting sanctions or there military on anyone they please. That&#39;s not what you call a joke. People arguing about how to leave an organisation for over 3 years. Now that&#39;s a joke.
Comment 306.4	The US holds the trump card when it comes to jokes.
Comment307	O Speaker tem uma paci√™ncia de Jo ...e n√£o sabe como por ordem na casa da democracia dada a confus√£o total a que o parlamento esta sujeito!! E voltam √† estaca zero...Isto parece um inc√™ndio e atrapalhados n√£o sabem onde √© a sa√≠da, exit!!
Comment308	No further proof is needed that Bercow is acting in a partisan manner.  It has always been obvious that he supports remain, but he has gone too far on this occasion.  He set a precedent by allowing Mrs. May&#39;s deal to be voted on more than twice so what is his excuse for stopping the meaningful vote... because he knows Boris would win?  Oh so now the speaker does not want Parliament to have its say... aren&#39;t these the people who were crucifying Boris for the prorogation because they claimed Parliament would not have a voice and now these hypocrites having smelt defeat do not want Parliament to carry out what it is there to do, what they claimed a few weeks ago was Parliament&#39;s sovereign duty????
Comment309	I really like the strict logic of the speaker; I think he really tries to be rational in an irrational time. I think a second referendum would be the best way out of this mess. The old one is 3 years ago now and, with the argument of the speaker, circumstances have changed now. Moreover it is strictly not democratic that a country follows on a decision the majority might decline now.ü§î To whoever reads this I am really  interested in your view on this üëÄüòä
Comment 309.1	@David Hudson Plus what&#39;s he doing in Brussels meeting EU chiefs?  Why doesn&#39;t one of the MP&#39;s hold him to task?  Conflicts of interest.  Let&#39;s here what he has to say from his green throne before they do a citizens arrest on him.
Comment 309.2	He didnt seem to adhere to strict logic when Mays bill was put through three times? Hes a pompous little man
Comment310	big F you from john bercow and these BIG F YOU&#39;S are the best
Comment311	Bercunt and his brethren at it again. BBC are happy. The left are happy. The LIBDEMS are happy. The SNP are happy. However the people are very angry and upset. The people will rise up. The people will have their way.
Comment 311.1	bonnie115 and you‚Äôre point is?
Comment 311.2	Some people are very angry and upset.  Others are jubilant.  17.5 million people may have voted to leave in 2016 but there were over 45.7 million voters registered in 2016 so less than half of the electorate (about 38%) voted to leave.  Also less than half voted to remain (16.1 million, about 35%) so around 27% of the electorate didn&#39;t vote.  The UK is a Parliamentary democracy, not a direct democracy.  Clement Atlee (later Labour Prime Minister) said, &quot;I could not consent to the introduction into our national life of a device so alien to all our traditions as the referendum which has only too often been the instrument of Nazism and Fascism.&quot; In March 1975 Margaret Thatcher (later Conservative Prime Minister) also quoted Clement Attlee that referendums are &quot;a device of dictators and demagogues&quot; as Napoleon, Mussolini and Hitler had exploited their use in the past.  Cameron allowing a referendum was a gross mistake enacted purely for the sake of his party and has completely backfired.  The problem is, both Labour and the Conservative parties are split between those think leaving the EU will be a political and economic disaster, and those who think it&#39;s akin to going to the promised land of milk and honey.
Comment312	You&#39;ve been Bercow&#39;d!
Comment313	Tiny  little oik ,  crawl aboard your  ship in a bottle and set sail .
Comment314	BBC playing into the government narrative again. This isn&#39;t Jon Bercow ruling it out. It&#39;s the parliamentary rules ruling it out.
Comment 314.1	Most people who follow the BBC are just sheep, who cares if I&#39;m laughed at by fools. Ta ta.
Comment 314.2	@cdeford I don&#39;t get it. Your comments are getting no upvotes, whereas mine are getting lots. Everyone who is reading this sees you making a fool of yourself and me continually dunking on you. You might be the worst debater on all of youtube. Why? Why not just think about things before posting. Do you enjoy being laughed at and dismissed all the time?
Comment 314.3	Are you 10, as well as thick?
Comment 314.4	@cdeford PAAAAHAHAHAHA. &quot;I have evidence I&#39;m just keeping it secret.&quot;
Comment 314.5	Sorry mate, I&#39;ve found plenty of examples. But there&#39;s no point showing you because you are too blind to see what every fair person already knows - that Bercow has behaved disgracefully in breaking precedent in his determination to stop Brexit.<br /><br />Here&#39;s is just one example, to give the lie to your statement above.
Comment315	So the people right to vote and win in a referendum is now pointless because a few people in the government think the British people are to stupid to know their own minds,so now whats stopping these traitors reversing the next Election if they dont get the results they like, this is the start of a slide down a very slippery slope of the death of real democracy in the UK,well start packing your bags when the EU gain back full control they will start to punish those wanting freedom, how long before they start jailing opponents,oh sorry its already started with Tommy Robinson .
Comment316	Simply this before he leaves his office   he intends to cause as much issue as possible   i pray for this court man to have a change of heart .the fact and truth are that parliament expected bus to vote &#39;remain&#39;  it stuck in their throats that we for bonce went agsinst their wishes ..had &#39;Remain&#39; won it would have been settled within weeks  but because it didn&#39;t go their way  and let&#39;s be honest  there are Elitists on both sides   Liebour using unions to battle their cause when in fact their sole interest is lining their pockets ..the cons  living up to their name   liberals so out of touch with reality and telling us how we will vote when they scrap the 2016 result . Scotland having a hissy fit ..and now trying to drag down the Welsh vote  through plaid jokers ..it&#39;s so sad to see that pre referendum in the debates every one of these  supposed Right Honourable people agreed to honour the result .<br />Dishonest  dishonourable and disrespectful ..I pray for them in Jesus name to understand that they are showing themselves for what they truly are  an evil almost demonic &#39;New World Order tied in with Church .<br />Its time for real people to&#39; WAKE UP&#39;  soon I hope ..God bless you everyone   Amen  Thank you for reading
Comment 316.1	Morons vote for elites at the general election, the same morons then spend four years complaining about elites in power.<br /><br /><br />Repeat.......repeat........repeat......<br /><br /><br />Nothing has changed in 50 years.<br /><br /><br />Einstein defined insanity as &quot;doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results&quot;.
Comment317	Who wrote that for him??? Lord Pannick by ant chance!??? This little toad must go, immediately. If he will bear stoically, with fortitude. Pompous prig.
Comment318	Wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful, though, if the people could vote every day on whether to eject Boris Johnson from number 10?
Comment 318.1	@Red Alert Clearly you have watched it more than I have
Comment 318.2	@David Hudson Shouldn&#39;t you be watching Celebrities eat Takeaways, or some other such drivel?
Comment 318.3	No thats not how it works numnuts
Comment319	Britain is unable to govern itself. <br />Britain should stay in the EU, dissolve parliament, abolish monarchy and ask Brussels to send governor to London.
Comment 319.1	axiom1  that‚Äôs exactly what they are preparing to do.  After three years of confusion and illusion they are ready to give up.
Comment320	He allowed Theresa May to bring exactly the same deal to be voted on 3x    knowing it would never pass but now he knows BoJo has the numbers to get this deal through, so he blocks this deal from being voted on. The speaker is afraid, his efforts are futile and he will get his comeuppance.
Comment321	Looked up the definition of &#39;eloquent&#39; <br /><br />John Bercow (n)
Comment 321.1	@Smash A Commie &quot;puppet&quot;, &quot;traitor&quot;, &quot;scum&quot;: same old tired, dehumanizing right wing rhetoric. like a constant drone sound incessantly screeching in the background: &quot;reeeeeeeeeee&quot;
Comment 321.2	@BigDudeSuperstar i&#39;m an admirer of Speaker Bercow&#39;s eloquence and a critic of bojo&#39;s crassness. i&#39;m also of the opinion that brexiteers, much like our GOP have no one&#39;s interests but their own at heart.
Comment 321.3	@Infernal460 Gentlemen, have some courtesy, please. Most parties around the table actually wants the UK to succeed, Brexit or not. I was admiring the speech craft, I think you should too.
Comment 321.4	@BigDudeSuperstar A traitor good at his &quot;craft&quot; is something not to be applauded.
Comment322	Bercow is the last great bastion of British democracy. He&#39;s one of the few left fighting for parliamentary processes and procedures to be implemented. Boris thought he&#39;d be a dictator like his friend Trump also one thought
Comment 322.1	&quot;parliamentary processes and procedures&quot;<br /><br /><br />For one issue that is against the will of the Britsh people.
Comment 322.2	Bercow is none of those things my friend, hes a jumped up arrogant little man....who will soon drift away
Comment323	Can&#39;t this clown be done for treason...
Comment 323.1	who Bercow? Olli Leftwin or Karl Corbyn
Comment324	Here he is taking a politcal stance. Don&#39;t worry people, Brexit will happen. Bercow, Corbyn, and the rest of the Labour party will soon be history. They won&#39;t be laughing then.
Comment 324.1	‚Äã michael hudson  It&#39;s also not my fault you have a ridiculously thin skin. You questioned my intelligence so I questioned yours... Have you never read a comments section before?<br />You&#39;re very unlikely to provoke aggression from me, that&#39;s more of a vote leave/ukip type thing. They&#39;re the ones threatening riots and civil wars when they don&#39;t get their way. Hell they killed an MP, worse we do is wave EU flags.
Comment 324.2	Two¬†offensive comment in a row. I&#39;m afraid you are far from convincing and I suspect it wouldn&#39;t take much for you to become aggressive.
Comment 324.3	@michael hudson It&#39;s a metaphor, if you can&#39;t understand that then you might actually be missing a few brain cells.
Comment 324.4	What a stupid and offensive comment. Grown up advice - stop trying to be smart -¬†it&#39;s not working.
Comment 324.5	@michael hudson It&#39;s not my fault your set of crayons doesn&#39;t have all the colours...
Comment325	Think we should all stop paying TV licence and council tax till Brexit is done! Wasting tax payers money dragging this out.. they can&#39;t arrest us all! Power to the people! The system is corrupt to the core.. total disgrace!
Comment 325.1	If I was running the country, I&#39;d abolish tax.
Comment326	A total disgrace! Should be sentenced to prison for being a traitor to the country and the people!
Comment327	He&#39;s a horrible, biased little shit.. The sooner he is replaced, the better.. üò†
Comment328	Bercow is not even trying to hide it now, long passed time for him to leave.
Comment 328.1	"@Stephen Mason Watch this and cry. - <a href=""https://youtu.be/Jl9ebaz9WU0"">https://youtu.be/Jl9ebaz9WU0</a>"
Comment 328.2	@Cars Rich People Drive whereas nothing about you is even remotely interesting.
Comment 328.3	@Stephen Mason Your distractions are rather amusing. Do continue.
Comment 328.4	@Cars Rich People Drive Not. Even. Close.<br />But I&#39;m beginning to understand where your confusion is coming from LOL
Comment 328.5	@Stephen Mason Yes shocking isn&#39;t it? Not really achieving much with this are you? Let&#39;s just address what you said there. Who is in the ruling position? The speaker of the house of commons rules nobody. He does however advice on procedure. He is there to ensure that procedure is followed. It is nobody&#39;s fault if they interpret the rules of procedure in a way that is different than he does. Likewise the opposite is true. It&#39;s a hard life sometimes, but you know, it goes on.
Comment329	I note that the Speaker was never biased prior to the referendum result because it seemed clear at that time his personal beliefs in the EU were not under threat. However since the referendum he, despite advice from his colleagues within his domain, he has shown that he has been more than biased despite his fancy rhetoric. It would be interesting indeed IF it is found out in the next months or years that he has had vested interests within the EU. He could have easily vacated the seat once his time as speaker had expired yet he, despite opposition was able to extend his role because he wanted to see out Brexit. The latter could easily  be read that he wanted to extend his time to aid and abet those who do not wish to leave. Despite all his seemingly endless powers it‚Äôs a pity he could not force parliament to implement their promise to abide by the referendum which was to leave the EU and not spend three years reneging on their promise.
Comment330	The speaker sits as Lord over them all. Arrogant man
Comment 330.1	@Phil D As above‚òùÔ∏è
Comment 330.2	joyce wilson you think he‚Äôd arrogant.take a look at the queen.she thinks her shit doesn‚Äôt stink.
Comment 330.3	jeck jeck that comment makes no sense ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Comment 330.4	@Phil D <br />It doesn&#39;t agree with his small brain.
Comment 330.5	joyce wilson arrogance ‚Äúhaving or revealing an exaggerated sense of one&#39;s own importance or abilities.‚Äù<br /><br />He is performing his duties. They require him to make decisions on what is ok and what isn‚Äôt. <br /><br />So what exactly is the problem?
Comment331	Have to say that Bercow is excellent at giving a thoughtful  measured response under such pressure. Very for people could manage that. That applies whether you think is ruling is right or wrong.
Comment 331.1	Bercow is entertaining style, over substance and progress. The public voted for Brexit without conditions or qualifiers, and the Speaker has simply found elegant ways to defeat their will.
Comment 331.2	<b>Very for people could manage that.</b> <br /><br /><br />Yes they could.
Comment332	"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N2cJctVBGo&amp;t=5m15s"">5:15</a> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm extraordinarily grateful to the honourable gentleman if he bears stoically with fortitude . . . I shall complete my statement.‚Äù <br /><br />Damn."
Comment 332.1	Richie Diggs Mellifluous and beautiful sentence.

Comment 332.3	Sasa thanks üôè
Comment 332.4	In plain English &quot;shut up, I&#39;m not done talking&quot; üòÇ
Comment 332.5	WHAT??
Comment333	Wow.
Comment334	Mr Bercow is the voice of wisdom, and fairness and honesty, The conservitives can&#39;t pull the wool over Mr Bercow&#39;s eyes he is to well read he is outstanding
Comment335	Notice he always looks up at the cameras , he is a traitor
Comment336	lol shot down by the speaker
Comment 336.1	It&#39;s amazing the things he can convince himself of now that he knows he is leaving and there&#39;ll be no consequences.
Comment337	Can they just all be honest with themselves, each other, and the public and just admit that they are intentionally not allowing Brexit? You owe your voting public that honesty.
Comment 337.1	@Phil D A problem that was ruthlessly exploited to full extend by those in the country with a right wing agenda and the help of some seriously racist and nationalist propaganda.
Comment 337.2	Cars Rich People Drive agreed. And even more honesty would have been telling people we already have the right to eject Eu citizens who can‚Äôt pay for themselves within 3 months, but the uk choose not to do it. <br /><br />This was a uk problem .. not an Eu one.
Comment 337.3	Honesty would be admitting that the whole thing was about sending eastern european folk back to their own country, which has largely happened, so there&#39;s no good reason for pursuing this idiocy. That would be honesty.
Comment 337.4	Ah, the public, that monolithic structure that thinks as one.
Comment338	There you go Johnny boy, Frau Merkel is very pleased that you continue to show your allegiance to the EU (Germany)! Democracy be damned ! People want to leave the parliament wants to remain.
Comment 338.1	But Auntie Merkel has been right about many things. including American not being a reliable Ally anymore.<br />That the need for EU army is pressing to defend European Interest. <br />All that Auntie Merkel has been laughed at in public. but come 2019 who is laughing now.<br />Now I am all for BREXIT cause of freaking hell unfounded British pride going to far. but Auntie Merkel still wants to keep UK as close friend and Ally without even penalizing their status in the EU . <br />So you can talk all evil about Auntie Merkel, but she has been more generous to the UK then I would ever be. <br />Must be that damn European Spirit haunting me to give in, or is that the liberal spirit :P
Comment 338.2	If you so favour democracy, then you‚Äôll agree that there should be a second referendum? Almost every independent opinion poll since last year has shown that the majority of the public want one. They will get to vote on the facts as they are currently, and with a greater understanding of what leave entails. The vote can be constructed more specifically to show if the public is in favour of deal or no deal. Put it to the public. If they decide to crash out on the EU based on the current facts, then that‚Äôs what we will do. Another vote is the most democratic thing we could do right now.<br /><br />The only people who don‚Äôt want a second referendum are leaver‚Äôs who realize that much of the public will not be fooled twice.
Comment 338.3	Actually, the people and Parliament are both extremely finely divided. There is no consensus for any of the possible outcomes.<br />That surely tells us that we&#39;re asking the wrong question and should start afresh now we understand the issues much more clearly.
Comment339	LOL Brilliant
Comment340	How can you make a man depart from his favorite hat? answer: You can &quot;Brexit it&#39; away from him..or you &quot;trump-tariff&quot; it away..<br />While the Brits sleep walk into a no mans land, and UK and American economies whither into a dead winter....Last night after Russians celebrated Trump&#39;s concessions in Syria, all drunken revelers chanted: &quot;trump, trump trump!&quot;<br />Frederick Forsyth or Tom Clancy could use a script like this in a novel, as it is absolutely incredible...
Comment 340.1	@Giggitee O&#39;Yeah <br />it&#39;s going to be fun to watch when the nightmare starts in  10 days.....
Comment 340.2	The US invaded Syria illegally and under Clinton ad McCain attempted to destroy the country for Israel. All of this is proven fact verifiable through searching through youtube. The fact Trump is obeying his electoral promise to not get involved in needless wastage of blood and treasure is hardly a concession and any conflict with Russia is undesirable- this has been the NATO position since date 0.<br />The UK and US economies are not in any danger because they are not entirely reliant on exports unlike China and similar third world nations playing at the adults table. US and UK domestic amrket has greater buying power than China&#39;s much vaunted &quot;middle class&quot; where middle class is defined as 12000/year- the definition of poverty in US and UK.
Comment341	So in short mp s read small print and realised boris shamming us ,he s not capable of sorting anything ,back to square 1
Comment342	Boris is <b>wrong</b> and the American senate Mafia is <b>wrong</b> ( Adolf Hitler is also <b>wrong</b> with dictatorship from 1933 to his final <b>Death</b> )
Comment343	Why does Bercow still have the role of the Speaker? The Speaker is meant to be impartial yet it&#39;s obvious he has a political agenda.
Comment 343.1	Lol he&#39;s following the letter of the law. He&#39;s only biased if <b>you</b> dont agree.
Comment 343.2	precisely. Glad some one else has the nouse to see it.
Comment344	Basically, the PM cannot bring the same bill on the table again in the same section. This is a basic respect of the will of the people enacted by the parliament, as the UK is a parliamentary democracy. This is also the House of Common still needed to vote and trigger the process, even though the referendum result is to leave. <br />The law knows nothing about any will of the people no matter it is reflected by a referendum/direct democracy, except insofar that will is expressed by an Act of Parliament. That&#39;s is why we need a general election that the parties put their Brexit plans in their manifesto, like what Lib Dem is doing, and people can vote for a majority government to put this to an end. A second referendum simply cannot help as 1) it is not legally binding and 2) it still needs the parliament to approve it which is remotely impossible if there is not raised by a majority government.
Comment 344.1	Exactly that is why Liberal Democrats have it simple, they only need to get the 16 million voters that voted remain.<br />The leavers well do you want a deal or no deal.... 17.4 million are already having a headache what they want. <br />Welcome to reality about will of the people, who are fickle and one day they demand this, next day they want that.
Comment345	There you go no point voting twice pointless with no substance, so the same rule apply to a second referendum pointless
Comment 345.1	Actually no it doesn&#39;t, it is of both different substance and a different sitting in parliement. On both counts it is ok to introduce legislation
Comment 345.2	You can barely write in English LOL.
Comment346	Bercow the British Brexit blocker.<br /><br />Dishonourable Speaker will go down in history as a notorious betrayer of United Kingdom.
Comment 346.1	Bigoted Brextremist tears hahahhahahhahhahhahhahahhahha hahahhahhahahhahhahahhahhahahhafuck offhahahahhahhahhahahhahhahahhahahhah
Comment347	Whomever replaces him is sure going to have boring ties üôÑ
Comment 347.1	Locke üëç Or necklaces üòÉ
Comment 347.2	He or she might even be boring enough to point out basic grammar mistakes, such as using &quot;whom&quot; in a subject clause..
Comment 347.3	This  man loves to listen to his own voice because as sure as  hell no one else does!
Comment 347.4	They are worn to detract from his large obnoxious gob and tiny penis.
Comment348	Bercow is arrogant
Comment349	My idea, take remain and no deal off the agenda, and have a referendum on Boris deal, or Corbyn Norway style deal, Surely the UK couod be a defacto member if Norway style, as of it;s power, yet able to control it&#39;s own borders, and laws,
Comment 349.1	Sorry but Corbyn did not back the Norway deal in the indicative votes.<br />He wAnts a custom union which will in effect hand all our trade policy to the EU and we will have no say
Comment 349.2	There is no reason sensible on earth the UK cannot simply up stakes and leave. Patrolling the borders is easy- UK has a sizeable military and the Europeans are too weak to dare fire a shot across the bows. The whole spectacle could be over and done with in a day- but for the financial institutions, banks etc who all are being dragged kicking and screaming from the trough.<br />This has been the pro Brexit position all along. No a Norway deal is not on the agenda, a totally EU free deal was the decision.
Comment350	The government has made the speakers jobs so much harder. He‚Äôs had enough of chairing brexit discussions.
Comment 350.1	TheHuzzlyn exactly my point he should of been removed as speaker along time ago he‚Äôs been proven bias in a job which is mean to the impartial
Comment 350.2	How did they make his job harder exactly? By requesting a second vote and then having the speaker deny it? Lol?
Comment 350.3	SHelby Dunne it‚Äôs the government who requested this second vote so I‚Äôm talking about them specifically.
Comment 350.4	TheHuzzlyn parliament not government
Comment351	BRITAIN THROUGHOUT IT&#39;S CENTURIES OF IT&#39;S BLOODY HISTORY.. BESIEGED BY IT&#39;S INSATIABLE CORRUPTION TREACHERY MONEY POWER STATUS AND LAND GRAB FROM WITHIN IT&#39;S OWN HALLWAYS..THIS IS FOLLOWING IT&#39;S DISGUSTING CHAOTIC HISTORY WITH THIS BEING JUST ANOTHER CHAPTER...GOOD LUCK
Comment352	Oh dare he wants to be popular as he stuck 10 years as Speaker of the House. He knows it is undemocratic but he choose this path to be popular to go further his political career. No fuckin politicians in the world care for public except their political career. As you realise and see the real is  fighting for their own choice not the public choice. I don‚Äôt know if our comment is bublisized to bring the politicians drama in public. I do not think this YouTube has a right to publish my comment.
Comment353	Every time remainers get assurances, they move the goalposts. Their aim is to stop brexit and act like the referendum never happened.
Comment 353.1	@niemanickurwa no one thinks they aren&#39;t.
Comment 353.2	It&#39;s so boring arguing with idiots. I feel like supporting remain just so I can argue with people who have a brain.
Comment 353.3	@Pardeep Parmar in your mind.
Comment 353.4	@Cars Rich People Drive you&#39;re still starting sentences with so, BTW ü§£
Comment 353.5	@Cars Rich People Drive the government doesn&#39;t want a no deal brexit we have a deal you moron. You are using the same excuse the SNP use to delay brexit and attempt to force a second referendum. Everyone knows that, I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re bothering to try to convince anyone otherwise.
Comment354	A compromise Deal, is really needed.
Comment 354.1	@Giggitee O&#39;Yeah there have been no losers. Its a referendum not a foot race.
Comment 354.2	No, I disagree. That would be pandering to the losers.
Comment355	I cannot believe it he is now quoting from Erskine May . what hypocrisy.
Comment356	Just have to respect this man some very hidden wisdom in between the point of orders
Comment357	He will get his soon
Comment358	England needs to QUIT playing around and withdraw from the EU...they need to be their own country again...this is bullshyt blocking the exit of the EU.....put president Trump in charge of the Brexit not this clown here..England would become their own country answering to nobody but itself....
Comment359	Solution is simple: The original ref was held based on lies and lack of information. People are more aware now whats true and whats bullshit. Hold another Ref. Democracy is always in motion. So why stop now?
Comment 359.1	Simple- the original implantation has not yet been implemented therefore a referendum would be on the hypothetical not the actual- and be somewhat premature- much like your father&#39;s ejaculate that seeded Remainers like you.
Comment360	All you remainers jumping for joy, you keep what doing you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re playing right into cumming&#39;s hands.
Comment361	British politics is corrupt to the core.... you need to stop talking about Russia China and other places because your number one corrupted and the people are realising this now beautiful
Comment 361.1	It&#39;s a hard and necessary lesson to be learned so in the future, people will be far less trusting and less complacent about the quality of their representatives. Painful, but what does not kill us makes us stronger.
Comment362	Beyond a joke.
Comment363	Islam is right about women...
Comment 363.1	The female anti-suffragettes whom no-one ever talks about were correct, many of whom were academics.
Comment364	I can not imagine Parliament with a Speaker other than the Hon. John Bercow.
Comment 364.1	Yuk.
Comment 364.2	@jason kingshott   Didn&#39;t times seem so much simpler then, etc, etc.  :)
Comment 364.3	Try and imagine a speaker unbiased and impartial.  That would be more functional than the remoaner traitor speaker we have now.
Comment 364.4	@SGW Good example of impartiality, doing her job.
Comment365	Im certain 90% of the comments are from lefty londoners who are just salty that leaving is certain. And that this is just a bump on a road to a nations independence.
Comment366	This guy is a remaining far left scumbag should be shot for betrayal of the people we will get  brexit power to the people listen to this weasel loves the sound of his voice bercunt weasel

Comment 371.2	Shitty actor who I&#39;d never tire of punching.
Comment372	wow. i love this man
Comment373	Bercow THE VERY BEST uncorrupted and highly rated would make a GREAT PM!! But he knows that its a bloody cesspit and so hes leaving and his shoes will NEVER be filled...A GREAT MAN!! JC for PM 1000% for sure..
Comment 373.1	Bercow for PM? Bercow for the rope, more like!
Comment 373.2	This sounds like a troll comment
Comment 373.3	Sadly you know little or nothing. You cannot have a 1000 percent. Bercow as PM? You must be a complete idiot. NEVER be filled? You are obviously fighting with your own demons.
Comment 373.4	How utterly unthinkably nauseating.
Comment374	the deal is jewish so it&#39;s a no go thank you come again
Comment 374.1	@Jeremy Atkinson If you refuse to acknowledge this by now you truly are blind. Your country is in the hands of Jews.
Comment 374.2	Certainly isn&#39;t a crock of Goldstein.
Comment 374.3	Flush yourself down the toilet you racist git.
Comment375	Basically he referred to a ruling made in  the year 1604 that he deemed to be relevant today... in 2019 and in the current situation that Britain is in. It beggars belief this Brexit situation. <br /><br />This country has got serious problems now. I must admit that I am not pro-Farage but I truly believe he might be the only person who can actually see any common sense in the current climate, and he‚Äôs the one who has been representing us in Europe. Before you start abusing me etc... this is only my opinion. <br /><br />Whatever happens, we need to Brexit otherwise democracy is simply defunct in this country and it will prove it beyond reasonable doubt. A vote is a vote.
Comment 375.1	@L√©o-Paul F. &quot;How can you say that parliamentarianism (never heard it called that!)  in the United Kingdom works?&quot;.   Surely you are kidding, sir?  ¬† Why is a leftists answer to everything always that it should be chucked out, that they know a far better way, that nirvana is attainable, and that history teaches us nothing?¬†<br />  Why?  <br />      The entire point is that she IS working.   Oh, she&#39;s not as spritely, efficient or as elegant as most would prefer.    But she&#39;s still there and, despite this dreadfully unilateralist behaviour of many elitist MPs, the people are still sovereign, a fact that is likely to be well illustrated at the next general elections. <br />       How can one say?    Because of the way she has served Britain for centuries, sometimes well and sometimes poorly but, quite uniquely on this planet, she alone is still there and has always found her level again.  <br />  &quot;How can one say?&quot;   Because she has protected one&#39;s absolute right &quot;to say&quot; such things for over 800 years. (The recent EU/UN compact on immigration and cultural homogenisation actually agrees to ban debate on the subject! ) <br />    It is no accident that the EU Commission also names its main council a &#39;Parliament&quot;.   Obviously it&#39;s not a parliament, but the &quot;Commission&quot; (internally pre-selected, meeting always in secret, keeping no audited accounts.) needs the people to feel they have at least some representation.   However, the structure, voting and remuneration system of the EU &quot;parliament&quot; effectively render it almost impotent against Commission regulation.¬†<br />       Your denigration of individual sovereignty, naive understanding of Britain&#39;s honest parliamentary system to select a PM, and your seeming enthusiasm for distant unelected, unaccountable and  irremovable governance may be acceptable, and only a little worrying,  when in one&#39;s late teens and early twenties.     ¬†<br />    However, that position becomes quite ridiculously immature, unread of all history, and simply immoral, if it&#39;s still held in later life. <br />    If people cannot see that Brexit has very effectively exposed the liberal elite, and that his is a struggle for survival between individual parliamentary sovereignty, and an wholly unaccountable, irremovable and already self-evidently corrupted collectivist totalitarian plutocracy, then they need to open their eyes.<br />    Simply put. This is a struggle between total wholly unaccountable power, too far away, and just keeping decisions personal, closer to hand and on a human sized scale.
Comment 375.2	SevenMagpies How can you say that parliamentarianism in the United Kingdom works after the Brexit episode? This system gives too much power to the House of Commons and the party system. Who voted for Johnson? What is its legitimacy except for the ten thousand or so Conservatives? <br />What the queen is doing in this mess? <br /><br />Then you talk about the globalist liberal elite, it sounds like a twentieth century Nazi vocabulary, and history shows us how it ends.
Comment 375.3	@L√©o-Paul F.   Those are all wholly subjective and personal opinions.   ¬†<br />     Should we not prefer to  consider facts in comparison?¬†<br />          One quite indisputable fact is that the self-empowered EU, as an increasingly sovereign entity has, since the day of it&#39;s inception in 1993 or it&#39;s legal empowerment in 2009, not managed to produce one project or single piece of legislation obviously beneficial to the British nation, or people of Britain.<br />       It&#39;s economic projects have all failed miserably, yet it still lauds itself with the successes of the old EC international agreements and cooperations, despite being involved in none of them.¬†<br />      Farage was the first and only person to raise this self-evident truth. Brexit was then the people&#39;s choice, and at least it has shone a spotlight on the lies of the EU ( any nation can may leave ) as well as the lies, and utter contempt for the people, by the globalist liberal elite.<br />    The 20th century taught us that distant centralised power and supposedly socialist collectivism are lethal.¬†<br />   So why anyone would opt for that unaccountable, irremovable, secretly meeting experiment in place of an 800 year tried and trusted national parliamentary democracy, based on personal sovereignty and Common Law, and especially on an island still, and increasingly, a successful global trading nation ( now 69% of the whole) is hard for me to comprehend.¬†<br />     Farage has not, as I see it, lied even once.    Maybe that&#39;&#39;s why he&#39;s hated.¬†<br />Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for either the EU Commission or the Council, or any of the &quot;EU subsidies&quot; think tanks in the UK.   May I suggest that Farage is not the problem, but maybe the cynical spreading of disinformation to promote distant and unaccountable power is.
Comment 375.4	@SevenMagpies Farage helped to put Britain in a weak position by promising mountains and wonders. Brexit is just the idealization of a glorious past. O tempora! O mores!<br />Except this is 2019, not 1850.<br />So one solution would be to say that the people can make mistakes, that they are not always right, that Brussels is in no way anti-democratic, that we are stronger united. There are obviously many other solutions, for me the Brexit has largely shown the limits of parliamentarianism for example.
Comment 375.5	This is how the UK constitution works though, through acts of parliament and court cases. You could easily turn your comment around to say, if something has been the law for over 400 years and not been revoked through subsequent acts and court cases, why should parliament suddenly ignore it in 2019?
Comment376	Bojo is trying to pass the most ridiculous and humiliating agreement under your noses, hopping you lost sense of smell.
Comment 376.1	@Giggitee O&#39;Yeah <br />The MPs will push for brexit referendum before general elections
Comment 376.2	Hopping? Like a rabbit? You can spell humiliating but not hoping....mmm
Comment 376.3	Perhaps or perhaps its a ploy to sell something deliberately unpalatable to trigger a snap election and that Tories and Brexit party have already made an arrangement.
Comment377	Proper RESPECT for decisions made by colleagues in the House of Commons on Super Saturday 19th October 2019 during the Brexit debates and cast vote of 322 vs 306 Speaker John Bercow says STANDS &amp; Will be UPHELD
Comment378	How dare he sit in that chair and try to hand over the country‚Äôs independence to the Germans and the French. Traitor!
Comment 378.1	You&#39;re right Mr Demetriou - how could we have been so blind?! That&#39;s exactly what John Bercow is doing. Well spotted!
Comment 378.2	...should probably look into his finances.
Comment 378.3	Stop talking Demetriou.
Comment379	Speaker was always a anti-Brexit
Comment 379.1	If it doesn&#39;t go my way, it&#39;s rigged against me -Every conservative EVER.
Comment 379.2	Good!
Comment 379.3	He is right though another debate would be a waste of time
Comment380	Government should have foreseen the Speaker would make this disgrace of a decision and held the vote Saturday.
Comment 380.1	Doveux Bercow betrayed the spirit of the rule which was to stop legislation being voted on time and again. This deal was not voted on that day. But water under the bridge now.
Comment 380.2	@Tom Maj The motion passed without division because nobody called out to oppose it. The speaker was correct in his decision; can&#39;t call another vote on the same thing less than two days after the first vote. Sorry‚ÄîI don&#39;t make the rules!
Comment 380.3	"orrrrderrr‚Ä¶.get the Brexit done and stopp this funny monty phyton show‚Ä¶.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Pt1YSdISw"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Pt1YSdISw</a> ..please..."
Comment 380.4	Doveux no they didn‚Äôt. They only voted on the amendment, not the deal.
Comment 380.5	They did. They lost.
Comment381	just use the magic ball already
Comment 381.1	Indeed.
Comment382	The speaker is a complete scumbag. Not really news he has been working on behalf of remain for a very long time.
Comment 382.1	@Ex Essex thought I&#39;d give you a thumbs up probably only one you ever get.üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Comment 382.2	Did the nasty speaker man say/do something you didn&#39;t like? Are you thoroughly miffed? Ah, poor old you...
Comment383	Such a shame that this great man whose honesty and integrity is one of the only bright spots in UK politics is leaving his post in the near future. Im sure that Brexiters and Conservatives will be screaming bloody murder at this decission to not allow another vite on the same but he is actually following parliamentary rules and law which what is suppose to happen.<br />Parliamentary law does not bend to the will of the people as parliament does not either. The body is elected by the people to represent them in the government and to potect them from matters which are very complex and might do them harm which is what parliment is doing right now.<br />Watching from Canada it has been intresting to watch how the British parliament has withstood the immense peasure that a segment of the population has been exerting on them and done what they believe is in the vest intrest of the country.
Comment 383.1	That&#39;s not really the issue. The issue is the motivation for the decision. Integrity and honesty- no I would not agree, Bercow has been shown to be a fan of the EU, a fact he never denies nor hides. I would argue we need a new speaker, one completely politically impartial.
Comment384	Bercow rocks!
Comment385	Commons hasn‚Äôt voted on Brexit deal yet. This is undemocratic. Let Parliament vote on it!
Comment386	Does the speaker has anything to do except saying ORDER
Comment 386.1	Not much...they are supposed to be impartial. Bercow forgot that and got involved trying to delay or abandon  Brexit
Comment 386.2	You might try listening a bit more. He does, however, sometimes use words beyond the understanding of an ignoramus. You&#39;re not one, are you?
Comment 386.3	He gets a large salray and fringe benefits. Probably a daily 7 course lunch at a fine restaurant.
Comment387	If your still paying the bbc licence fee your a prick
Comment388	Bercow is a remainer and has been bought by Grieve.
Comment389	In your face!... Boris fuck face!   Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Comment 389.1	Communist
Comment390	Muahahahahaa this tiny rainy island is hilarious. pure comedy gold.
Comment 390.1	&quot;We&#39;ll muddle through&quot; has always been the phrase of the UK. Hundreds of wars and still ticking.
Comment391	Pedo leader of the house hates democracy, he needs molesters tunnels in Europe, which this little legged pervert will Loose if we leave EU
Comment392	Bercunt is a total piece of shite, dishonest, corrupt &amp; traitorous horrible self opinionated dwarf......those are nicest things anybody could say about this turd.
Comment393	This entire speech, about how it would be repetitive and unnecessary to vote again on Saturdays vote, should be used for anyone who wants a second referendum. As Bercow states we must respect the decision that has been made
Comment394	How can we really be sure that any of them are honourable? As I don‚Äôt personally know them I have to make that judgment on their behaviour, and it is far from honourable
Comment 394.1	@Samuel Carrington Why who gives a F about Epstein, he was murdered we all know it. which billionair in the states going to commit suicide, when he only has to serve 5 years in luxury prison for rich people. and then he is off to his island and living in security with all his bought under age girls and hot women.
Comment 394.2	Is there a resin the bbc is totally ignoring the ep stein case?? What about Prince An drew?? Royal pea do? Why isn&#39;t the bbc covering this?? Are you still covering up for pea dos like you did in the days of Jimmy sa vile?<br />BBC = pea do protection
Comment 394.3	@Jamie Johnson so dude how does it feel to be WRONG again, and suffering from reading comprehension and I was even soft on you LOL
Comment 394.4	@Jamie Johnson LoL are you saying I am trying to put you in a ditch? nah you can find it yourself nothing better then seeing you write another garbage. BEN ACT oh my you must dyslexic too.<br />I bolded it for you this time.
Comment 394.5	@Drake Hound Haha you could try and put me in a ditch but it would not end well for you, trollboy. Again: The courts ruling does not compel Boris to negotiate a deal, merely to request an extension
Comment395	I believe there should be another referendum. Vote for this deal or to leave without a deal...It&#39;s what the Remainers have been crying out for. The people&#39;s vote..
Comment 395.1	@Giggitee O&#39;Yeah Not really, it would drive them crazy. No option to stay in just whether we accept the deal or not. Call their bluff on the final decision..
Comment 395.2	But that would be pandering tot he Remainers who already lost.
Comment396	Traitor
Comment 396.1	Sidney Snott 3 years of dither and delay, any excuse not to have the meaningful vote they are all corrupt
Comment397	Come on. Just leave without any deal. I really want to see how UK can go down.
Comment 397.1	I must say that although I&#39;ve always been against the UK leaving, I&#39;m now very curious to see what happens if they do - especially if it&#39;s a no-deal Brexit. It would be fascinating to watch from the comfort of the EU country in which I now live and which is sensibly not taking part in the UK&#39;s experiment. So I agree - just fuck off so we can see what happens.
Comment 397.2	me too
Comment398	The anger of a small man
Comment 398.1	Who can&#39;t comb his hair or tie his own shoes
Comment399	How I wish every legislative assembly (Uganda in particular) had such a Speaker!
Comment 399.1	@Giggitee O&#39;Yeah, we have 1, that&#39;s with time, turned into an executive&#39;s constitutional printer. Speakers after the other always take anything the executive brings to the chambers.
Comment 399.2	Uganda- how many legislative assemblies do you have and or need?
Comment400	This is how debate and accountibility works. Brilliant.

I‚Äôm just not happy about the way the Tories are handling it and there are issues like the Good Friday agreement to consider, we don‚Äôt want a return to civil war. Make no mistake, there‚Äôs a huge difference between following the will of the people and landing us in ruin. The people of Britain did not vote for no deal. <br />Regardless, the real issues are far bigger. We‚Äôve had a pm foisted upon us yet again and this one, another crazy-haired game show host, has been found to have lied to the people and acted unlawfully! Why is he still in his position? I‚Äôm concerned about upholding the law of the land, something BoZo is pretending to care about whilst doing the very opposite. John B is saving us from being thrown to the lions by a wanton bunch of fools who are in the pay of some very bad forces, none of whom give a fig about the people of Britain.<br />Brexit be damned. There‚Äôs a war on that needs to be stopped immediately and we don‚Äôt want another with the IRA!

Comment 401.2	Penelope Jones : It is not a banishment that I am stating but after hearing similar themes in my own country where people like one state or another I always tell them to go where they would be the happiest. Your people voted to decouple itself from the EU. No matter how hard that vote may have been, that was the result. The parties in Parliament said they would abide by the referendum. They are not doing that. Parliament may be the governing body but they ceded that to the people and they chose Brexit, to which the government must obey the winner of that vote.  My only hope is that this resolves peacefully. Your country had a life before the EU, it will have a life outside of it and you have a part in it should you want to. At the end of the day be where your life will be the happiest.
Comment 401.3	dennis perusse I‚Äôm not against leaving the EU but thanks for offering my banishment! Whilst I‚Äôd be happier in Wales or Scotland I‚Äôm not thinking of anywhere further afield just yet.<br />What I am against is being in the hands of the elite, where BoZo is intent on keeping us and I‚Äôm very grateful to John B for single-handedly and completely honourably having the balls to stop the Tories riding roughshod over our democracy.<br />What I‚Äôm praying for is Jeremy in No10 and a start towards common decency and in that spirit please accept my warmest wishes for your health and happiness.
Comment 401.4	Sidney Snott : I sincerely hope you get through this as cleanly as you can. Best of luck for you and your people.
Comment 401.5	Sidney Snott : The impeachment will never happen as the inquiry has not been voted on to do. As much as I am no fan of Trump, an actual determination of what is labeled a high crime and misdemeanor has to be in order. The House of Representatives has to vote on impeachment proceedings to which they won‚Äôt do.<br /><br />As for your problem a question needs to be asked. Why hasn‚Äôt a new election be done yet?  If you trust the people and Parliament then a new election can‚Äôt hurt. It has been called for and a vote of no confidence in the government hasn‚Äôt been called for. A final death to your zombie government with a new on would clear all this up.
Comment402	I‚Äôve never witnessed such a biased move in my life, what a complete idiot Bercow is, I can‚Äôt wait for him to step down. The basics are that the public voted out and these PUBLIC SERVANTS should go about their work to see that through no matter what their personal agendas are. I‚Äôm sick of seeing these smelly, fat and obnoxious idiots argue with each other trying to ensure they can line their pockets in the future with EU jobs and EU pensions and at the same time making a mockery of our government to the global audience rather than cracking on with what they should be doing. What a bunch of idiots they all are.
Comment403	This man is an idiot you should go out with a wheelbarrow pathetic loser liar just like with the other politicians why are we taking all these why are we allowing them to do this why why why

Comment406	Proper respect for the rules of the house? What about proper respect for the will of the people of this country!?
Comment407	"Today 21 October 2019 day will remain in infamy, Bercow<br />clearly indicated on which side <b>*UNBIASED</b> speaker is. <br /><br />By egomaniac&#39;s eye-bulging manners, dishing out vindictive biased decision<br />showed not only malignancy of the sick judgment by the present head speaker, but also in bad sportsmanship spirit, arrogant with a great deal of speaker&#39;s anarchistic now so well known, using the power of chair, so blatantly against those who DARED to criticize him, his bias and deliberately injurious chair rulings.<br /><br />Is it not a RIPE TIME for Bercow to retire/go away and allow judicial new speaker, unbiased one to sit in that chair?<br /><br />His attitude clearly expressed his narcissistic muscle power, (weakling&#39;s) game exploiting to fullest chair privilege, only his means to hide behind. <br /><br />Victims are  United Kingdom citizens. Not useless  MPS at present. <br />Clearly, none in that HOUSE of HORRORS care about people. <br />Just stroking their own EGOS, none representing their as claimed falsely their constituency as so blatantly exhibited by&quot;speaker&quot; <br />TODAY. <br />ORDAAAH ORDAAAAAH ORDAAAAAH , ambitious &quot;primate&quot; to become Prime Minister in his secret thoughts./dreams.<br />He may be powerful on the chair, knowledgeable, decent bloke in past<br />but  TODAY, openly revealed himself,  as nasty as rabid alleyway mutt talking from the corner of his twin tongue mouth. <br />BERCOW are you good for own as promised to retire on 31 October 2019?<br />GOOD RIDDANCE.<br />Or U TURNER?<br />----------------------------------<br />As remoaners surgically dissect every word spoken or written, so the GOVERNMENT should have the right to run the country for better or worse. <br />Let people decide. <br />Speaker&#39;s decision was pure VINDICTIVENESS and abuse of chair power to dish out punishment to those who dared to criticize HIS MAJESTY Bercow, in past sessions."
Comment408	How about a vote of no confidence for the little two rag in the seat.
Comment 408.1	@Sidney Snott This guy is biased, anyone can see that. Why has this vote not taken place?
Comment409	Just do no deal
Comment410	Love this man! How he will be missed, and I love the way he counter-attacked the attack on him personally. Could not comment on that video, but he is fair an realistic, whatever tricks the government wants to use
Comment 410.1	@Pavarossi #1 Don&#39;t worry about us. The UK has been around enough years to look after itself. We&#39;ve been through worse times than these. Granted we did believe we lived in a democracy but after the General Election things will be sorted..
Comment 410.2	mhffc man, for your sake I hope you are right. But the days that brittania ruled the waves are definitely over. And whatever you want to do when there will be a referendum in my country, feel free to do whatever you like. I wish you all the best for the future, and hope you will not regret your choice. But remember, it is YOUR choice, so when things turn bad, do not go and blame it on anyone else but you yourself
Comment 410.3	@Pavarossi #1 Well I&#39;m sure if ever your country has a democratic referendum I will be sure to let the majority of your country know that I think they have made a mistake and were lied to..And they were all too stupid to look at the facts beforehand.<br />And the UK is to small and insignificant. You&#39;re just showing your bias and ignorance now. The UK is a member of the G7. And one of the top three financial contributors to the EU alongside France and Germany..Many countries around the globe are waiting to sign trade deals with us, something we can&#39;t do while tied to the EU.
Comment 410.4	mhffc that is your opinion, mine is different, but we are both entitled to our own opinions. To me, I still think it was a big mistake to have the referendum without knowing in detail what you are voting for. Many people voted for what they perceive as freedom, to make your own bills, set your own standards. But that is not how it works in 21th century, with powerfull countries or region as US, China, Ondia will come, Russia, the EU. You need to have power to negotiate a good deal, the UK in itself is to small, to insignificant. But let‚Äôs see how it will work out
Comment 410.5	@Pavarossi #1 No the majority of people do not want to stay, as the referendum result proved. Scotland and London are very pro EU, outside of that England and Wales are pro Brexit.  And as for the young the majority of them couldn&#39;t even be bothered to vote. And ask the young why they want to stay in the EU half of them haven&#39;t got a clue..Most of them in a poll didn&#39;t even know where the EU Parliament was or the name of its President. Typical entitled children who aren&#39;t used to getting their own way.<br />And you may have forgotten it was the common people who voted on mass for Brexit. It&#39;s the rich and the big banks that want to remain. Labour the so called party of the working people have blocked Brexit at every turn, in their heartlands people voted to leave. So all this about Boris not caring about the common people is total rubbish.

Comment412	ONCE AGAIN 17.4 MILLION OF US WHO VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. ARE BETRAYED BY THE TREACHEROUS LITTLE REMAIN-LOVING RODENT CALLED JOHN BERCOW.
Comment413	There must be a huge price to pay come the next election for those that have stymied Brexit and denied the Referendum result. I am fast losing faith in parliament and the British democratic system. The BBC‚Äôs cheerleading of the denial of the democratic mandate, and its blatant partisan support for Remain, will also not be forgotten. End the license fee now!
Comment414	to be granted by EU, any xtension must be fully motivated.   <br />the 3 letters sent by Le Blond, do not explain the reasons for xtension.<br />in the past, EU was ready to grant xtension in 2 caes:  2nd ref, or GE.
Comment 414.1	How good of you, well it is a sad thing we have Internet nowadays, that everybody can see the reasoning behind Bojo childish political games.that even spinnsters must be sad. DRAT for the REAL TIME INTERNET. <br />It does make Political Backstabbing a lot easier... and understanding a desperate PM cause.
Comment415	Its simply an amusing game of chess to these chortling jeering jokers, to try and subvert through every mechanism and technicality of the political machinery at their disposal, the mandate given to separate via a referendum three years ago. Obstruction and Frustration is employed as a long war of attrition designed to break the voters will by kicking the food bowl away whenever it gets close to our lips. Know and understand what is happening. Ignored by parliament, the public has no reason to comply with anything. Ultimately it will be a pyrrhic victory for them, if they succeed.

Comment420	is Bercow the only sane person in parliament? i don&#39;t fully understand - maybe it is the language barrier or the highly exquisite style of expressing, that he possesses...

Comment422	As a French I grab popcorn and wait for a no deal brexit. No more american 51th state in EU.
Comment 422.1	Your French state, your past three crypto Juif Presidents Hollande, Sarkozy and now Micron the gerontophile with obvious mother issues former employee of Rothschild, has been an American colony since the French really had the balls to say to the Americans they were wrong about Iraq, something the NeoCons and Israelis never forgave them for. Moreover France is as Bismarck wanted , the expanded Grosser Alsace-Lorraine. You arrogant French lack the wit to see it, being bedazzled by illusions of your sophistication, to grasp reality.
Comment 422.2	Yes France is so stable at the moment. How many months have the Yellow Vests been protesting. If they carry on any longer your friendly neighbour will step in to sort your problems. Get a warm welcome like they did in 1940..
Comment 422.3	51st*
Comment 422.4	Jeremy Pintsize No more French in France or countries in Europe. One world government - better together!
Comment423	Presumably Bercow has been offered a job by the BBC when he leaves this one?!
Comment 423.1	Or the EU.
Comment424	I don&#39;t think they even have a process on how to remove a Speaker.  He knows they were going to run another candidate against him in the next election &amp; he knows he would not win.  He says he is quitting by the end of the month, so he ciould give a flying F....<br />They should put him on the bench &amp; bring his replacement in early at this point.
Comment 424.1	@Orange CrushOK. Thanks for the clarification.  The Next season of: &quot;Brexit: the Final Count-Down--again!?!? &quot; is going to be boring without him at least  for all of us in NYC; The Brexit distraction is also a nice balance to the insanity &amp; chaos of the impeachment hearing;  occupation of the Impeachment hearing ; and the very real rumours of our first Presidential removal in our history. Stay Tuned to SEE &amp; HEAR MORE MELTDOWNS!! WATCH IN AWE Congressional and Parliamentary  Occupations by BOTH sides of the Aisle!!! <br />FEEL the frustration elation and utter indifference of the people of both countries as proceedings on both side of the pond DRAG on and on!!! This should be a real humdinger!!!
Comment 424.2	@Helene Papageorge It&#39;s all talk.  He did an interview, but no formal &#39;resignation&#39;.
Comment 424.3	Wait. Hasn&#39;t Bercow already submitted his resignation for 31 Oct.?? I believe I heard him say that in an interview or else I read it in the NYTIMES
Comment425	The only problem with the way the letter was sent to the EU was that it was not first used as undisposed of toilet paper used on the arses of all members of the ERG and possibly more brexiteers totaling 17.4M in the course of their daily relief procedures!
Comment426	So Bercow leaves on October 31st. If there is an extension there will be a new speaker. So there&#39;s no way of avoiding the inevitable.
Comment427	Our politics are a mockery, Embarrassing THE PEOPLE VOTED!!! OBEY THE PEOPLE!!!
Comment 427.1	(AWP_Home) That&#39;s not what MP&#39;s exist for.  They exist to make sense of the shit the people throw at them.  MP&#39;s should act to protect the people from their own ignorance and stupidity whereas Boris, the vacuous solipsist, is using it to enhance his status regardless of its effect on the rest of the country.
Comment 427.2	yeah obes the mob
Comment428	What a superb speaker is John Bercow. Flawlessly logical.
Comment429	the ber-COW desease is spreading in WM.<br />that coward ber-COW is going to veto anything the Gvnt asks.<br />this speaker is a disgrace, and must be fired, asap.
Comment430	My issue is; the sovereignty of the people is being undermined by the sovereignty of members parliament and they are applauding themselves about it.<br />In the old days they would have had their heads separated from ther bodies. Nowadays a general election should do just that
Comment 430.1	Rosie 6857<br />Opinionated nonsense! In this great unwritten UK constitution King, Parliament and The People, all have their day and The Peoples day is on election day and right now the courage of Parliament seem to have disappeared up its own rectum rather than to give Us our day.<br /><br />At best U went to Uni. to graduated as an educated fool, a perfect oxymoron in reality, and a nobody to tell me to keep quiet
Comment 430.2	(ajaya) The sovereignty of Parliament stands above everything so the issue for you is obviously that you do not know how the country is run and you would be better keeping quiet about your ignorance rather than displaying it for all to see.
Comment431	Thumbs up or down for civil unrest if we don&#39;t leave?

Comment434	The vote of the people to come out of the EU . will not be respected. The Uk will never come out (No Brexit) They are only in it for themselves. I would be surprised if a deal could be done EVER. Boris you should start looking for a comfortable ditch. The UK has become the laughing stock of the world.
Comment435	We live in a corrupt government. We are not part of the elite, The Remoaners will try every thing in there power to stop Boris in every way possible, 17.4 million people Voted to leave.. Bring on the general election, It will happen.. every single MP will be Voted out there seat.. Jeremy corbyn is the biggest traitor going... He&#39;s a middle class traitor, Who has betrayed the working class people.  Same with every labour MP in the country... Democracy is Dead. This country lost all respect..

Comment437	The people voted to leave. The Party responsible for delivering it have a way forward. Vote on it. Who is this miserable little hobbit Bercow, He is a footnote in history. A despised one at that
Comment 437.1	@Ex Essex Your still in the EU  because the politicians that do not want to leave are holding the rest of the country to ransom. What do you mean the majority of people voted to stay? Do you have a brain injury or something.?The election result was 52 pecent to 48 percent to leave .Whatever you have been smoking in the last few years, I suggest you give it up.
Comment 437.2	I don&#39;t despise Bercow - I love him. And by the way THE people did not vote leave, SOME people voted leave. 17.4 million is an impressive result but only 37.4% of the electorate, 62.6% of whom did not vote to leave. You&#39;ve never had a mandate. Why do you think we&#39;re still in the EU?
Comment438	Ok we tried for a deal... leave means leave and no deals just fine Thankyou ... onward to 31.10.19
Comment439	John Bercow you are a jewel. Thank you so much for your just and open mind. I shall miss you for ever in the House. I see you at times as a reincarnated Shakespearean character, for fairness and playfulness and grace and fortitude and englishness. Best wishes, and thank you for leaving behind such a clear signature imprinted  in the House.

Comment447	Ditch means ditch Boris!
Comment 447.1	Well Boris Johnson says that he would rather be in a ditch dead than support a Brexit extension.  I think that we should arrange to have him thrown into a ditch and shot, so that SOMEONE ELSE can implement the Brexit extension!
Comment448	boris johnson&#39;s deal is softening so much, he might as well enact the labour party&#39;s proposal.
Comment 448.1	to be part of the customs union &amp; to offer the public a 2nd referendum, with  the  choices being remain or leaving the eu under labour terms; you obviously haven&#39;t been paying much attention to what&#39;s been going on with brexit, have you?<br />to help you, boris johnson is a former remainer who wants to leave, while jeremy corbyn is  a former leaver who wants to remain, albeit reluctantly; johnson wants to get a deal with the eu b4 oct 31st, or he will look like a bigger liar than he usually is, &amp; lose all credibility; <br />corbyn has bowed to the whims of the remainers in his party, because he needs their support in the election; he should have stuck with labour&#39;s 2017 election pledge to honour the will of the people &amp; leave without another referendum; if he does call for a 2nd vote, which he can only do if labour win the election, remain should not be on the ballot paper, only no deal or labour&#39;s deal.<br />brexiteers can&#39;t criticise labour&#39;s leave deal, because the referendum was a binary choice between leave or remain; no policies were attached - it was either stay or go.<br />capiche?

Comment451	This is very sad the United Kingdom is controlled by the fuckin traitor Speaker of the House like John Bercow. This is very sad the Pri Minister of a United Kingdom has no power and it is a alien Country now. Government should have the power to over rule any undemocratic challenge or activities by traitor undemocratic MPs who has no respect will of public decision.
Comment452	I used to admire This Speaker John Bercow. But, Listening to his glib semantics at such an important and historical time under the realisation that the majority of the public voted to leave the EU and have been waiting now for years and now more weeks because of such Rhetorical clap trap according to the bloody rules, has led me to believe he is out of his depth. And his unfortunate tendency to favour falling back on obstruction and delay through the cobweb strewn rules of the house, rather than have the balls to make a brave and righteous decision and lead the UK into the future instead of wallowing in such bilge and outdated commentary on the behaviour of the house. Frankly it&#39;s embarrassing to watch. He should stand aside or retire now and allow a fresh and uncluttered brain to carry through these proceedings. I am sorry to say i wish he would loose his voice again....let the Government get on with it man.
Comment 452.1	@Ex Essex The simple facts are....Brexitier&#39;s won the vote in a democratic election. Regardless of your &quot;factual&quot; figures. Get THAT right!
Comment 452.2	@Paul Thomas Oh please don&#39;t apologise!...He used his privilege as speaker to put his own interpretation of the situation as it stood and then made a decision based on his opinion of the balance for an outcome...whether it be a a judgement call or based on age old and outdated rules ..it was his personal right as a &quot;Non-political member of the house to call it. If it had been a ruling set in political law he would not have had the casting vote. It is an archaic rule used in a loose framework of behind the scenes shenanigans putting pressure on a outgoing speaker.
Comment 452.3	He is following rules of parliament based on precedent and explaining his reasons on doing so. The government doesn‚Äôt just get to do whatever they want. Sorry.
Comment 452.4	&quot;...the majority of the public voted to leave the EU... NO, NO, NO. 17.4 million voted to leave = 37¬Ω% of registered voters or 26¬Ω% of the population. Therefore, a substantial MINORITY of the public voted to leave the EU. Get your facts right.
Comment 452.5	i see almost no difference between 49% votes to stay and 51% votes to leave, especially when this vote was made up on false facts and personal feelings. it was just a mistake letting the mob make a decision that affects the whole nation on long terms because most people just dont have the mental horizon needed to make such an important decision. you have to accept that the good old times will never come back, same for the coal mining and steel production in my area, its gone forever. at least it doesnt affect me for i am german but whats pissing me off is this never ending shitshow. first 2 years were funny to watch and we had a good laugh but now its just lame and annoying. just make an end or as we say here &quot;make nails with heads&quot;. we are pissed off for the british attitude that we are responsible for the english situation. all of you also had benefits from being part with the eu but you just dont want to see that and thats a slap in the face. all i hear is &quot;we suffer, we dont wanna pay, me this, me that &quot;  ill have a big party over here when u finally leave, throwing english ale and english vinegar crisps out of my window. its only sad for ireland and scotland, both held hostage to the bitter end.

Comment459	The people&#39;s will is being thwarted by politicians playing politics. They all want to get back at the trough and will throw the people&#39;s will under the bus to get there.  I await Labour and the remainer&#39;s next move to prevent the UK from leaving the EU at the end of the month. Let there be no doubt, they will find something, even if is cancelling Brexit.<br />An afterthought might be to wonder why it is improper for the government to vote again on the same issue,  and why is it proper to suggest a new Brexit vote. Isn&#39;t this asking the voters to vote AGAIN on the same subject?

Comment 462.2	Chrisd&#39;stard leave means leave , only way to shut the remains up is to have a general election üó≥ only way ,it‚Äôs costing 1 billion pound a month, the political people who are doing there best to make us stay should be made accountable.üá¨üáßüá¨üáßüíØ%üëÄüëÄüëÄ
Comment 462.3	@thehumburgerWhat would the question be? It should be soft or hard Brexit, as we&#39;ve already voted to leave and there still appears to be some difficulty in the heads of remainers as to what the the word &#39; leave&#39; actually means.
Comment 462.4	@thehumburger had a referendum by 2million majority win .so ovious trying engineer a referendum with limited options only deal on the tabled negotiated under extreme unfair process .against remain.should be deal or no deal .election be rigged limited choices laws put in place before an election .democracy only work for remain agenda .think remain some how overturn it it will go away your as deluded as the rest of em.cant cheat 17.5 million .deal at the very least.
Comment 462.5	Tim Pullen no fear at all , it was 17.4 million but after what the Europeans are trying to stitch us up I‚Äôm thinking it will be more like 25 million to leave , general election only way now or we will never get out .
Comment463	This is hilarious, the Deal the glorious EU gave us won‚Äôt be allowed a meaningful vote because it wasn‚Äôt voted on. Let the no deal commence
Comment 463.1	Stray Dawgs Sweden - I want Bercow to keep stopping it because it‚Äôs a terrible deal regarding the trade negotiations to come, which is the real deal. I want them to defeat this and make a no deal a greater possibility. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact what he is doing is wrong. Letwins Amendment made the whole reality on the ground different and Bercow is being utterly obstructive denying that
Comment 463.2	You don&#39;t want the MP&#39;s to read it first and have a chance to see the final version before voting on it?  It would be like paying for a house without knowing where it was, how big it was or what condition it&#39;s in.  Or in one word - stupid.
Comment464	Hi BBC ,Mr bercow must be your hero because he doesn&#39;t like freedom and he doesn&#39;t like democracy
Comment465	The corrupt parliament won&#39;t even allow the corrupt mps in parliament to vote that&#39;s how far the remainers have to go to try and stop Brexit total lunacy!
Comment 465.1	Corrupt? Any evidence of corruption? If not, shut the cake hole.
Comment466	The little ballbag could hardly contain his joy.  You could string him up on any rafter; even a Wendy house would do the job.
Comment 466.1	You&#39;re Scouse and you oppose him?<br /><br />He&#39;s against the lying Tories you idiot
Comment 466.2	lol
Comment467	Worst Speaker in history biased remainer shill  his wife ( remainer labour member ) destroyed him he was once a respectable person and politician
Comment468	Let the people to decide their future, instead of political parties.
Comment 468.1	@Marcus Knupp Referendums are not legally binding, so legally the Government can ignore the results.
Comment 468.2	@TCR It wasnt an analogy, it was meant for you specifically.
Comment 468.3	@Hal Swan That&#39;s one of the worst analogies I have ever heard.
Comment 468.4	@Hal Swan Illegal? Referendum? Sex? I didn&#39;t get it
Comment 468.5	@Marcus Knupp maybe because it was illegal. So you can vote next time to have sex with your 7 year old girlfriend, but it will still be illegal for you no matter how many want one or voted for it.
Comment469	This is so boring now and totally predictable. The UK must be a laughing stock. We can&#39;t make a decision. When a deal looks like it will get passed, everyone panics and start trying to delay. They don&#39;t want a no deal, they dont seem to want a deal either. Bercow is so biased it&#39;s unreal. Labour have no idea what direction to go just seem to be backing anything they think will get them elected or stop Boris.
Comment470	Austerity cuts pushed vulnerable people of the edge. The Tories breeched Human Rights artical3!<br /><br />Citizens are expendable!
Comment 470.1	David Hudson ... still waiting on a reply.
Comment 470.2	David Hudson ...answer to your first sentence - The people who had to endure the humiliating and debasing assessments and the uncertainty that ensued.<br />Third sentence - ‚ÄúYour face says it all.‚Äù<br />What face? Please let me know what you mean by that?<br />Fourth sentence - About trousers. Could you please <br />paraphrase for me?<br />I look forward to your reply, Mr Hudson.
Comment 470.3	David Hudson ... unfortunately I did attend state schools and was near destroyed. From five till sixteen they, pedagogues from hell, slapped and strapped me while shouting every negative, demeaning adjective they could at my bewildered and frightened little being. Consequently, I left their establishments with zero confidence, unlettered, and hating myself because they emphasised it was ALL my fault!<br />Yes, I went to school all right!
Comment 470.4	Who are these People of the Edge? So mercilessly pushed by austerity. Your face says it all. Exactly how did the Tories put trousers on human rights? Did you go to school Tom?
Comment471	Yes, yes, but thank god Bercow sits in that chair!
Comment472	I agree with the speaker&#39;s ruling on respecting the time of the parliament. However, it is a shame that there is no binding convention for the parliament to respect the time of the people. It is unethical and unprofessional for MPs to introduce legislation for a second referendum when they have not done anything in the last three years to implement the results of the first referendum.
Comment473	Worst house speaker ever.
Comment474	Welcome to hotel California.
Comment475	&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;FREE ASSANGE&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
Comment476	Bercow impartial as always
Comment477	SHOCKER THEN!!! THIS MAN IS CORRUPT AND A DISGRACE TO THE SPEAKER&#39;S CHAIR!!
Comment478	Agree or disagree with his decision, Bercow is the coolest guy in the house. Always calm, rational, and assertive. And ORDAAAAAHR!
Comment 478.1	‚Äã@Martin Baldwin-Edwards keep quite? what the fuck are you going to do? nothing like the rest of you soyboys you will do fuck all
Comment 478.2	@TheSirAshton90 No, you&#39;re the joke, mate. I&#39;d keep quiet, if I were as stupid as you.
Comment 478.3	Cool? Are you an idiot? Always calm and rational??
Comment 478.4	calm ?? half the time he looks like hes pushing a poo out to hard. The mans fast become a joke of democracy
Comment479	Well, we are surprised and it will thankfully soon be the 31st Oct and we can hopefully install a totally impartial Speaker. Bercow‚Äôs legacy will speak for itself when reflected upon in the months and years to come as a Showman and not a great Speaker.
Comment480	This is the only sane man left in parliament. He is a legend!
Comment 480.1	If you like your sane men biased and tiny. Each to their own.
Comment481	Well its not what the politicians want.. Its what the people want.. And they wanted out! <br />End of!
Comment 481.1	@Tim Pullen so what type of remain were you voting for?
Comment 481.2	@Michael how can you still be pedaling the idea that the UK was going to join the Euro? Im sorry mate,  it just shows that you don&#39;t bother to read proper documentation. It was never on the cards.  You do know that the Lisbon Treaty was enacted almost 10 years ago.
Comment 481.3	@Tim Pullen the polls show an increase for remain by 2% going from 52% to 54%. Even after 3 years of information post result. Let&#39;s not pretend that remainers didn&#39;t lie, talking about World War 3 and a recession. What were remainers actually voting for, was it to keep things the way they were or voting to join the Schengen, the EURO, the EU army etc.
Comment 481.4	Yalneva what some of the people wanted based on some lies,  the people have seen Brexit and they don&#39;t have the same appetite as before.  Are you going to tell us that you knew all of the ramifications before you voted?
Comment 481.5	as brexiter do we have better deals in table ready to makes us more reach  then those we have now
Comment482	the more this drags on the more i and most leavers lean more towards sod it, leave no deal wto. less messy, ive had enough of the shenanigans now. BRITISH DEMOCRACY NOW PLEASE!
Comment 482.1	correct 3.5 years ago 17.4 million UK citizens voted LEAVE whatever way but LEAVE.
Comment 482.2	Lean all you want - nobody cares.
Comment483	The speaker is always been biased and he clearly been against the brexit the speaker I used to respect he shown his real face against the democracy and work against the people vote in the referendum shame on the speaker
Comment484	He deserves  a medal.
Comment 484.1	Yeah, for services rendered, from Germany.
Comment485	Let commerce fly.... no government bureaucracy
Comment486	Bercow is a dreadful speaker and comes across as a shallow vain little bully. Good riddance
Comment 486.1	"Today 21 October 2019 day will remain in infamy, Bercow<br />clearly indicated on which side <b>*UNBIASED</b> speaker is. <br /><br />By egomaniac&#39;s eye-bulging manners, dishing out vindictive biased decision<br />showed not only malignancy of the sick judgment by the present head speaker, but also in bad sportsmanship spirit, arrogant with a great deal of speaker&#39;s anarchistic now so well known, using the power of chair, so blatantly against those who DARED to criticize him, his bias and deliberately injurious chair rulings.<br /><br />Is it not a RIPE TIME for Bercow to retire/go away and allow judicial new speaker, unbiased one to sit in that chair?<br /><br />His attitude clearly expressed his narcissistic muscle power, (weakling&#39;s) game exploiting to fullest chair privilege, only his means to hide behind. <br /><br />Victims are  United Kingdom citizens. Not useless  MPS at present. <br />Clearly, none in that HOUSE of HORRORS care about people. <br />Just stroking their own EGOS, none representing their as claimed falsely their constituency as so blatantly exhibited by&quot;speaker&quot; <br />TODAY. <br />ORDAAAH ORDAAAAAH ORDAAAAAH , ambitious &quot;primate&quot; to become Prime Minister in his secret thoughts.<br />He may be powerful on the chair, knowledgeable, decent bloke in past<br />but  TODAY, openly revealed himself,  as nasty as rabid alleyway mutt talking from the corner of his twin tongue mouth. <br />BERCOW are you good for own as promised to retire on 31 October 2019?<br />GOOD RIDDANCE.<br />Or U TURNER?<br />----------------------------------<br />As remoaners surgically dissect every word spoken or written, so the GOVERNMENT should have the right to run the country for better or worse. <br />Let people decide. <br />Speaker&#39;s decision was pure VINDICTIVENESS and abuse of chair power to dish out punishment to those who dared to criticize HIS MAJESTY Bercow, in past sessions."
Comment487	He is a remoaner sack him .
Comment 487.1	John john all they do is moan?
Comment 487.2	Daniel Watson. they want to stay in the EU all they do is moan they wanted a deal Boris got one and now they won&#39;t vote for it.
Comment 487.3	John john whats a remoaner?
Comment488	Bercow = traitor<br />The British people should forcibly enter parliament and remove him.
Comment489	John Bercuck
Comment490	Well done Bercow. These Brexit architects are traitors. He knows this. So do people who have an idea about their agenda. Brexit will ruin our country...everyone except those super rich who own the media and who push this con onto the rest of us. Sir John Bercow...deserved.
Comment 490.1	Le Sigh...are you a Nationalist? Quick go and look up what that means! Half wit.
Comment 490.2	Le Sigh...why can‚Äôt you use your own words and not that of aThe Daily Mail? <br />So what EU control are you looking forward to not obeying if we leave the EU? Can‚Äôt answer that can you you fool.  <br />Do you know about the sovereignty we have? The laws we legislate ourselves without asking the EU to agree? Like going to war. Like controlling our own borders? You talk as of we are at war with the EU you clown. Because the media wants that from you. The media...80% owned by scum on the Right. Lord Rothermere, Barclay Bros and Rupert Murdoch. But you crack on with your brainwashed treason you moron.
Comment 490.3	In what way are they traitors and to whom? They are betraying the EU that want to control and dominate the UK, but not the betraying the UK itself who they wish to set free from that control. You are either very confused, very stupid, or a traitor in favour of EU control over the UK yourself. Which is it?
Comment491	Just leave on no deal, we&#39;ll send you food from the US, that &quot;chlorinated chicken&quot; you know
Comment 491.1	@Martin Baldwin-Edwards There is nothing wrong with chicken that is rinsed in a mild chlorine solution. Its a tiny fraction the concentration of chlorine in the water in a swimming pool, and its not going to do ANYTHING to you. If you ate a million such chickens, you might get some toxic effect from the chlorine, but you would have died of obesity related problems long before the chlorine got to you.
Comment 491.2	The thing is that the idiots here would eat it, thinking it to be high-quality grouse or something. Johnson and the entire Tory party would prefer to fly to Paris for all their evening meals, to make sure that they eat good food.
Comment 491.3	@Carole Taylor No, don&#39;t you know chlorine is LETHAL? If you accidently swallow water in a swimming pool, you will DIE.<br />Jeremy Corbyn would not lie to us.
Comment 491.4	Our Salads are washed all the time with chlorine - or we&#39;d all be seriously ill or dead with the diseases chlorine eliminates. Chlorinated Chicken was all scare mongering by remainers and the remainer media! I don&#39;t see Yanks getting poisoned and their chicken was very nice when I had some!
Comment492	This is what a broken political system gives you.
Comment 492.1	He is following the traditional rule of Parliament since 1753, its the same parliamentary rule everyone has been using since then. Sorry you are so uneducated
Comment 492.2	This what giving conservatives power does,
Comment493	&quot;Proper respect for the decisions it takes...&quot; lol<br /><br />What about proper respect for the decisions of the electorate? Whos decision it was to exit the EU... and who voted all you treasonous clowns into office? Democracy is dying and we are bearing witness to it right now... remember where you were when walls started to crumble !!
Comment 493.1	dont fret!! democracy is an on going process and will always come out on top. this is just weird times because the referendum was based on lies, and many people wish it hadn‚Äôt gone that way. what you are witnessing is 3 years of people wising up and the will of the people shifting. when we re do the referendum all will be corrected, it just takes time
Comment494	Bercow is biased against Brexit.......I wonder if he is looking forward to leaving his job as speaker and going to work¬†for the EU or perhaps he has had¬† an early Xmas gift from Soros.......Either way he is a C**T of the first order!
Comment 494.1	Soros is a great guy
Comment495	Backside to Boris from Beckrow for Non-Compliance.
Comment496	Hero Bercow owning criminal billionaire Rees Mogg and his gang!
Comment 496.1	Speaker B-cow will go DOWN in history !
Comment497	Understanding that the Speaker‚Äôs ruling is based on a point of procedure, I still think that given the rapidly approaching deadline, some procedures could be suspended. This move smacks of political maneuver, aimed at delaying proceedings long enough to necessitate an extension. We see maneuvering like this here in our own Congress, and it‚Äôs at very least, destructive.
Comment 497.1	It&#39;s all the funnier that the times he has suspended procedure <b>just happened</b> to give a huge boost to anti-Brexit group, and all the times he has chosen to uphold standing procedures have <b>just happened</b> to favor anti-Brexit positions as well. It&#39;s all just a coincidence, you see. LOL
Comment498	Bercow explains EU. Disappointed english Brexiteers of course wish Alice Wonderland... and of course they `voted`... being leaded by lies and noise in a quality of 193... from the beginning... and now England is tired of House of commons, repairing this vote-nonsense ? Make it a holy vote, by making parliament calculating the real facts, ladies as gentlemen... <br />Get up Empire in a present scale: you can work on one, being recognised by 500 Mio people and a single market... but now take a strong coffee, shake your heads, take out your dog into rain, if avaliable... You are not really tired ! Use your angriness, stay awake, take a long range modus beyond october 1932-bullshit, what future for UK is about !<br />No Clowns, no Brexit. Stay, make us all run by your power of change. <br />Being Great Britian ? Eggs needed... So realize your power inside EU, not by being disleaded to pure promises ! A small nation, China smilingly will realize... and Trump ? Trust ? Every promise is welcome in so emvious eyes, to get EU splitted... thank you, Mr. Johnson.
Comment 498.1	China is nothing. All it has is fraudulent money created from admitted fake statistics. It is a bubble running from the prick that will pop it.
Comment499	Let&#39;s be honest though knowing what the country&#39;s going through is this really breaking news? üì∞ü§£
Comment500	The only democratic way to solve Brexit is to let the people vote again.
Comment 500.1	You are a mindless idiot -- repeating stupid right wing slogans like &quot;clean exit&quot;. If you want a clean exit, pour some bleach up your arse. That&#39;ll be similar to Brexit.
Comment 500.2	‚Äã@Martin Baldwin-Edwards wow could you be more contradicting. MY country is my main priority all you have to do is look at what other european country&#39;s have become since joining the EU. a deal will will destroy this country in a year remaing will destroy us in 10 a clean exit is are only hope
Comment 500.3	@TheSirAshton90 No, That is not democracy. I am not interested in the stupidity of Cameron, nor should you be. Our country is more important than the idiots who are currently running it: rich kids who were educated at Eton and told that they were the brilliant leaders of Britain. They are not. They are the sons of rich crooks. End of story.<br /><br /><br />And you need to understand that.
Comment 500.4	@TheSirAshton90 that is just being naive and childish. Where is the harm one voting again. Let&#39;s just say, when you are separating from your partner but you still love her. You wouldn&#39;t you think about the whole thing twice.
Comment501	So why did he allow Mays deal to be put through three times, the same issue.
Comment 501.1	@Mustrum Ridcully    Clair. As in the song.
Comment 501.2	@Mustrum Ridcully   GOP. and TORIY c**ts.
Comment 501.3	"@Mustrum Ridcully    &#39;79- Thatcher<br />&#39;83- Liberal.<br />&#39;87 Labour.<br />92 (giving <a href=""http://birth.no/"">birth.no</a> show).<br />97 Labour.<br />2002 Green.<br />2004 SNP.<br />(No Liberals standing in my area.)<br />2010 Green.<br />&#39;66 Labour. (with my mum).<br /><br /><br />."
Comment 501.4	@Mustrum Ridcully    NOT ME.<br />Have voted for the &#39;promises&#39;, never personality.
Comment 501.5	@Clair Duffy Nobody is impartial Claire. Everybody has some form of bias. Right now he is causing problems for the tories, thats good enough for me. I dont have big aspirations or dreams, as long as the tories are ruined for the next 30 years :)
Comment502	all these delaying tactics and political moves should surprise no one,  this plan was hatched in<br />collusion with the EU,  let&#39;s not forget this is the same speaker who took it upon himself to conduct<br /> shadow negotiations behind the UK&#39;s official negotiators back, with David Sassoli. the current<br />EU president.<br /><br /><br />according to Mr Sassoli they both agreed to facilitate a second EU referendum. the Surrender act,<br />and John Bercow&#39;s and the other remainers actions are all a part of this scheme.  but they cannot<br />hide from the people forever.
Comment 502.1	@R Tee ain&#39;t long m&#39;y time with you mate, but you are so dar from the truth, what you&#39;re saying aren&#39;t fact but utter nonsense
Comment 502.2	@illuminatutos  John Bercow is an absolute disgrace,  the speaker should be a neutral<br />Umpire,  not a player on one side.  Brexit was never the mp&#39;s decision to change, in all<br />true democracies,  politicians don&#39;t get to choose which public votes they respect.<br /><br /><br />democracy can only work when the losers accept the result,  if remainers don&#39;t accept<br />the result of the first EU referendum,  why should Brexiteers accept the result if they were<br />to lose any future EU referendum??<br /><br /><br />remainers should be careful what they wish for,  if Brexit is overturned.
Comment 502.3	Lmfaoooo populist propaganda got youüòÇ
Comment503	Seems like many in the comment section (most of whom were likely among those posting witty haiku&#39;s in praise of Mr. Rees-Mogg) are suffering with language comprehension.<br /><br />The same issue can&#39;t be debated twice when it&#39;s the house has already decided on it, and Mr. Rees-Mogg should know this.<br /><br />It isn&#39;t &#39;treason&#39; despite the illiterate throwing that word around constantly and it&#39;s not undemocratic. If you think that&#39;s the case, you should have no issue with those of us calling for the final decision to be put back to the people, given we now know just how damaging this will be.
Comment504	An English revolution giving us a proper constitution and real democracy is about 350 years overdue.<br />Parliamentary democracy = the greatest oxymoron.
Comment 504.1	Do yourself a favour and study some British constitutional law along with some political subjects like Democracy (specifically representative) and its alternatives. Im not disagreeing with you, I‚Äôm merely requesting that you educate your dumb ass before giving such a detailed exegesis on the effectiveness of Parliamentary Government.
Comment 504.2	We had one 331 years ago :p
Comment505	Time to get rid of Victorian Parliament and the speakers role and black rod and all that rot passed its sell by date
Comment 505.1	And you don&#39;t think that 18th century Rees Mogg, 19th century Johnson and his billionaire sponsors are past their sell-by date?
Comment 505.2	USA not to prove the point tho. How is parliament doing? Standing up for over 1 million people ... I doubt it.
Comment506	I know that it is going to be an extremely unpopular thing to say, but I have to give credit where it&#39;s due. Mr. Bercow blocked a deal that would have left us a vassal  kingdom governed by  the EU. As corrupt a person that he is, he showed he has a heart, and he used it today.  Mr. Speaker, please use your power wisely, and show you are wise enough to keep Britain in one piece. Thank you for stopping the May Sellout Surrender Treaty. All five versions of it, and make sure he doesn&#39;t get a chance to  put up Maybot 6.0 . I don&#39;t want to live in a police State. The bill he blocked would have insured we ended up in one.
Comment 506.1	How is the UK going to erupt in a major civil war because of Bercow&#39;s mealy-mouthed waffle? Surely,, surviving a world war is a little more traumatic than blabbering about points of order.
Comment507	The ditch is nigh for Boris  -- this politician wished to die out of ignorance!
Comment508	So what happened with the first meaningful vote?
Comment 508.1	Thuuhat - There was none because Letwin the narcissist made it a non meaningful vote. The court stopped the prorogation because of the Brexit deadline being a ‚Äòone off‚Äô but Bercow picks and chooses how to apply the law but only in a way that frustrates Brexit and stops Parliament doing it‚Äôs job. The reason the courts got involved in the first place was allegedly to make sure Parliament could act in a time of national importantance. This is laughable
Comment509	This has now become unreal no pm can do anything with this this place is more than broken
Comment 509.1	@farsensor operant I fully understand that but it&#39;s becoming a joke
Comment 509.2	We have checks and balances to prevent  politicians violating parliamentary procedure and the law!
Comment510	Good.<br />No deal it is then! üëç<br />üî•üá™üá∫üî•
Comment 510.1	Mr. Wigster only if the EU allow you to!
Comment511	Let it all go to hell. The IMF is waiting for these clowns
Comment 511.1	The clowns being John Bercow and Jo Swinson I hope. Both have taken hundreds of thousands in payments from George Soros and his &quot;open society&quot;, to push to remain in the EU.
Comment 511.2	Hopefully not, but even so, they would be better than being under the thumb of Rottefuhrerin Merkel and her Duetsche Bank.
Comment512	Was ANYONE expecting the opposite. Leaving with no deal now is more possible.
Comment 512.1	@Michael Glynn NO, that is not correct. Obviously, you are not a lawyer. EC Art. 50 requires that exit is in conformity with  a country&#39;s constitutional requirements. IN the case of the UK, that means the Benn Law has to be obeyed. End of discussion.
Comment 512.2	Martin Baldwin-Edwards <br />Two laws contradicting each other. The first law has not been repealed and still stands!  We‚Äôre out!
Comment 512.3	No. It is not legally possible now for the UK to leave with no deal. Perhaps you did not understand what the Benn Law achieved, and the response today from the EU governments and Commission.
Comment 512.4	Yes! Agreed. We&#39;re leaving with no deal. Take note
Comment513	Is nerve wrecking and time waisting a crime??? Should be. Good reason to jail all UK politicians by now. Somewhere on another island of a former colony?. Or better the Falklands!
Comment514	<b>Biased traitor speaker be traitoring.</b>
Comment515	It looks like Bercow wants to overtake government, similar to what Pelosi is doing in America! They should get married!
Comment 515.1	Its written into the parliamentary rulebook. You cannot discuss the same bill twice in one session, it&#39;s just how it works. Bercow followed the rules.
Comment516	Heading for a no deal exit yayyy <br />Here we go WTO
Comment 516.1	Do hope so.....
Comment 516.2	richard buckwell that is wholly in the hands of the EU27, so I rather doubt it.
Comment517	prick
Comment518	The last nail in the Brexit coffin is the chair itself!
Comment519	The only person in that Parliament with some integrity. Shows the arrogant Leader of the House that he must learn the rules.
Comment520	A huge headache. Neverending stories to justify the delay on brexit ...3 wasted years, 3 years of uncertainty...and the mps will happily continue this cycle. The people suffers in silence but not for long.
Comment 520.1	Who&#39;s suffering? I&#39;m not. Who&#39;s silent? Did you see the demo on Saturday? Have you heard the racket outside parliament lately?
Comment521	Bring back capital punishment so we can hang these traitors.
Comment522	I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re pro remain. If you&#39;re rooting for these corrupt tyrants to keep us in EU against our will, then i have nothing but burning contempt for you.
Comment523	Hear, hear !!!
Comment524	parliament &quot;We cannot leave the EU without a deal, because it will destroy the country.&quot;<br /><br />Also Parliament &quot;We cant allow a vote on this new exit deal that we thought you wouldn&#39;t ever be able to get because...arcane procedural reasons.&quot;
Comment 524.1	@David Hudson <br />Economically. DUH!
Comment 524.2	In what way will the country be DESTROYED?
Comment 524.3	Tim Pullen <br />The vote should not have been amendable in the 1st place
Comment 524.4	@C Laws some people who will have believed the lies might change to leave.
Comment 524.5	@Tim PullenBecause people are only allowed to change their minds if they change it to remain. I&#39;m sure that is the logic they use.
Comment525	Tosser
Comment526	I‚Äôve had enough of this bullshit now. North Korea here I come.
Comment527	Traitor Bercow
Comment528	The uk will always be able to say boris Johnson broke the country and their economy not brexit.

Comment 528.3	David Hudson I know nothing. But I know the uk and England more importantly economic and political power are done for 2020 onward
Comment 528.4	@Celab Williams The statistics dont bear that out. The leave vote has slightly increased actually.  You have a lot to say for someone who knows very little.
Comment529	traitor!! to the tower and off with his head!!
Comment530	I don&#39;t get why it is so hard for people to understand...Leave means to leave the EU and all of its institutions...So leave is No Deal...Any treaty added on is a deal, even if that be a free trade agreement or the sale of bum hair for whigs....The UK voted to leave...Simple really.
Comment 530.1	David Shields <br />Three years ago the British people voted out !<br />All we‚Äôve had from the scum in Westminster is a, three times reheated treaty offering us MORE EU !!
Comment531	No love lost between Rees-Mogg and Bercow.
Comment 531.1	@Trick C FROM the Pope
Comment 531.2	Bercow probably gets hate mail off the pope
Comment532	Ffs. At this point we should just either give it all up (really bad option) or leave without a deal. Just a bunch of bullshit people that can&#39;t make a decision that they apparently &quot;love&quot; the country and it&#39;s people enough to get done.
Comment533	Leave means leave
Comment534	So this one man can rob the people of any democracy they have. Madness lock him up as a traitor and Letwin is still a SIR when he has ignored the people&#39;s wishes. General Election please so we can get rid of all these self centred traitors.
Comment 534.1	@Thierry Mercadier My dear foreign friend we British never give up&gt; As we fight for what is right (ask MR Hitler as he too made the mistake of thinking it was over and he could win by killing democracy ) and sadly my cave is full of Albanian criminals who are also claiming trillions from our hard earned taxes, why we suffer through cut backs on our services..Your name is French so I am assuming you are from France. So how do the french people like the open borders that allow terrorists to blow up French people in their own capital city? I must admit a cave full of french women and wine would appeal more
Comment 534.2	Dave it won&#39;t be long before you can freely return to your cave !!! Brexit is over get over it !!!!
Comment535	There is no cow in Bercow!
Comment 535.1	@No Regerts I suggest he gets a part in a Yiddish theater. He is cut out to be an actor.
Comment 535.2	JP VOGEL just a lot of bull?
Comment536	I love him
Comment 536.1	@delta250a agreed. Hear hearrr
Comment 536.2	@baff Baff Your mum loves anyone but you.
Comment 536.3	His wife loves anyone but him.
Comment537	That was done with great mastery of wit. Superb!
Comment538	If Boris Johnson keeps his promise to protect environment/wildlife, I give him permission to destroy Brits.
Comment539	Please vote for the monkey party at the next election. Could it be any worse than what we already have?
Comment540	I think we should start calling him MOOO COW üêÑ
Comment541	Boris Johnson is different than Psycho Terrorist Trump. At least Boris Johnson cares about the environment and even African wildlife. Those issues are more important than stupid humans.
Comment542	Can they not just vote on the deal because if we have to wait until amendments to be done then wait for parliament to argue about amendments.. then I assume any changes have to go back to Eu ... they will say no as they are happy with the deal struck... so all I can see is lots lots arguing and everything going round in circles and nothing behind  settled... parliament by acting this way will be in fact causing a no deal brexit... which they have the benn act preventing such a situation... isn‚Äôt this rather crazy?!!! So my brain hurts thinking about all of this... my respect for those in authority is running out ... ü§Ø
Comment543	So Bercow rails in public and in private about the responsibility that he has to ensure that Parliament has the opportunity to discuss important legislation . . . even if it means overruling prorogation convention . . . but then he WON&#39;T overrule convention to ensure that Parliament can discuss the government&#39;s withdrawal deal motion.  Such self-contradiction is a hallmark of bias . . .
Comment544	John Bercow is right again.  Troll all you like but he is right.
Comment545	Bercow being a chopper as usual
Comment546	I thought this guy resigned.  I was hoping he‚Äôs replacement would be a significant timprovement.  Pathetic
Comment547	That&#39;s exactly why Democracy is considered rather complicated. I doubt, that the majority of voters can follow John Bercow&#39;s narrative.
Comment 547.1	Nothing to really follow, he&#39;s a Remainiac!!
Comment 547.2	@TheSirAshton90 Bercow made it very clear to me, infact I know why he would reject it since Saturday. You need to try to understand a little about the law
Comment 547.3	Narrative- interesting attribute to apply to democracy, better suited to a staged drama. Panem et Circenses?
Comment 547.4	‚Äã@MaryHaleyKelly it dosnt matter if its law or not for fuck sake..... they asked what we wanted they all said they would uphold the vote and respect it. We had the biggest democratic vote in the history of the nation.<br /> now we should just ignore it? give your head a wobble
Comment548	What happened to the speaker of the house being neutral?
Comment 548.1	@Xbox Won I lost nothing and don&#39;t need any excuses.   I already said, I didn&#39;t vote.<br />It&#39;s win, win for me.  I am just here for the ride.
Comment 548.2	@SGW u lost the peoples vote simply put stop making excuses
Comment 548.3	@Tim Pullen who cares
Comment 548.4	@Xbox Won I have no idea of which you speak.  My comment was that a word was completely wrongly spelled.  There is no such word as &#39;&#39;proberly&#39;&#39;, it is probably.  I didn&#39;t read about unions or whatever you were talking about.
Comment 548.5	@Xbox WonNo it wasn&#39;t.  17.5 million people are not &quot;the country&quot;.
Comment549	Brexiteers: &quot;We want to vote on it until we get the result we want:&quot;<br /><br /><br />People: &quot;Okay, can we have a second vote on a pack of fantasies from three years ago?&quot;<br /><br /><br />Brexiteers: &quot;No, you hate democracy.&quot;
Comment 549.1	Matthew, if we had a second referendum and leave will still win then what? Will sore losers such as yourself still campaign to overturn democracy or will you take the result like a man rather than a spoilt brat?
Comment 549.2	We didn&#39;t have a vote on a &quot;pack of fantasies&quot;. We had a vote answering the straightforward question whether we wanted the UK to remain in the EU or leave. It was a simple binary choice. Like it or not, this is how democracy works, by putting an X next to a choice on a ballot paper. In any election the onus is on the electorate to educate themselves as best they can regarding the issues involved. You can&#39;t just assume that everybody is completely uninformed or misinformed about the issues in this vote  any more than you can in any other. If people are capable of reading and using Google they are capable of doing sufficient research to reach a reasonably informed understanding of the pros and cons of EU membership. People do not rely solely on politicians or even the mainstream media as their sole source of information when making their minds up on how to vote.
Comment 549.3	But they never voted on the deal on Saturday, they bought a different bill in instead,  I watched it all day so what is he talking about
Comment 549.4	Three &amp; half years of Project Fear lies.... Now they want a Referendums until the EU gets the result they want:<br /> 2nd June 1992. Denmark, by Referendum, rejected the Maastricht Treaty. Made to vote again.<br />8th June 2001. Republic of Ireland, by Referendum, rejected the Nice treaty. Made to vote again.<br />29th May 2005. France, by Referendum, rejected The European Constitution. Vote ignored.<br />1st June 2005. Netherlands, by Referendum, rejected The European Constitution. Vote ignored.<br />12th June 2005. Republic of Ireland, by Referendum, rejected the Lisbon Treaty. Made to vote again.<br />5th July 2015. Greece, by referendum, rejected punishing bail out conditions. Given even harsher conditions.<br />6th April 2016. Netherlands, by Referendum, rejected the EU association agreement with Ukraine. Vote ignored.<br />23rd June 2016. United Kingdom, by referendum. chose to leave the European Union.

Comment 552.2	Farcical comedy? Brexithill aka Bennyhill
Comment553	This man has to go. He is not impartial.
Comment 553.1	He&#39;s been impartial through the entire process. It&#39;s not his fault that the Brexiteers constantly attempt to unconstituionally circumvent parliament or breach parliamentary procedures.
Comment554	This British Parliament is never going to deliver the referendum result. Remainers could not care less for democracy in this country. They want their own way, and will play every dirty trick to achieve it, ignoring the 17.4 who voted leave. Their treachery is on plain view. The silent majority don&#39;t protest, scream, shout, but there is an anger that is growing, and it is the &#39; silent&#39; that these traitors should be concerned about.
Comment 554.1	Go Winner, and be bekharmed! Feels ironic that he wrote Death Wish as well.
Comment 554.2	Cars Rich People Drive Your wording is unclear. Attempted insult, just angry. Sorry if you are not a troll.
Comment 554.3	@Angel B You appear to be under the delusion that I am telling you to be quiet, which I am not. Try reading what I put again, so you can assuage your fears. Thank you for the attempted insult of calling me a troll, but considering you are feeling bullied in some way, I shall take that under consideration. Have a nice day.

Comment 555.2	Nitro I think you&#39;d find he would be against the Tories.
Comment556	The withdrawal act was not discussed because the Letwin Act precluded it‚Äôs introduction Bercow is incorrect and can I say biased He must be censured
Comment 556.1	John healy because you don&#39;t agree doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not neutral
Comment557	In other words, no.
Comment558	The Prime Minister promised that next week the government will introduce all the laws, the adoption of which requires the &quot;Letvin amendment.&quot; And he said that he hoped that after that the parliament would support his agreement with the EU.
Comment559	A true proffessional does his job with flawless integrity
Comment 559.1	@C Laws I have always voted moderatly right.
Comment 559.2	And you are a truly professional liar. Have you considered becoming a Labour or Lib dem MP?
Comment560	I get why he has done this, it‚Äôs written in the rules yadda yadda, but what I don‚Äôt get is why a clearly bias single minded ‚Äúlittle‚Äù man can have so much power,  he is supposed to be the referee, the professional fence sitter who prevents political matters getting out of hand, in line with rules, policy &amp; law but most of all to stop politics from getting personal, HE FAILED AT IT ALL he failed because he let his own feelings,views and beliefs cloud his professional judgement, it would not be allowed in any other theatre he would be struck off yet even after calling it a day he still remains the most powerful man in the country, this country is so messed up!!
Comment 560.1	Darren whyman - He can only do it because they won‚Äôt call for a GE. The government is not a majority so they use the speaker to change the rules when it suits because the Government can‚Äôt stop him. He‚Äôd have no room to do it after an election. He‚Äôs tipping the scales that‚Äôs why they want to stop a GE as long as possible

Comment562	This man is a disgrace!
Comment563	So basically by not being able to vote on the deal parliament is causing a no deal brexit!! Even tho they have an act brought by themselves preventing a no deal brexit... so does any one know what the hell is going on this is totally unacceptable ü§Ø
Comment 563.1	They will now extend the process indefinitely, or revoke article 50 if the EU refuses an extension. this speaker and this parliament have no intention of allowing the referendum result to be carried out.
Comment564	Bercow disgraceful known bias anti brexit weasel <br />This individual should of been removed last year, he&#39;s lucky it was not when Oliver Cromwell was around he would of   had him thrown in jail trialed for treason and executed.<br /><br />Welcome to the remainiacs HOUSE OF REMOAN to CARRY ON REMOANING REGARDLESS where everything to get brexit done gets voted down or blocked by the house of remoan against the will of the people and the government.
Comment 564.1	mr democracy you are even more butt hurt than Bill Cash! Hahahahahahahahaha!
Comment 564.2	Because democracy is putting people to vote based on nothing but lies üëÄ
Comment565	Don&#39;t get me wrong but can you please make up your mind......the fuck is this game......we want a deal  aaaaa no we don&#39;t want a deal.....aaaa we want a new deal......etc
Comment 565.1	They lie constantly. They were insisting it was only a no deal Brexit that they were trying to avoid, but as soon as the government brought back a withdrawal deal, parliament switched to blocking all discussion of that instead. they want to stop Brexit entirely, and they will break every rule and burn down our democracy to do it.
Comment566	Boris couldn&#39;t run a bath.<br />He doesn&#39;t know most of the rules of Parliamentary proceedure but tries to con Bercow by trying to put one over.<br />Boris was , is and always will be a grubby little chancer with the ethics of a Grantham grocer&#39;s daughter.
Comment 566.1	Those were the days when a grocers daughter could get to the top.
Comment567	Little man with too much power.
Comment 567.1	mr democracy sounds like you are on the verge of a massive coronary. I hope you can still get your meds after Brexit.
Comment 567.2	Welcome to the remainiacs HOUSE OF REMOAN to CARRY ON REMOANING REGARDLESS to stop brexit happening.
Comment 567.3	LLT Collection you should write Boris Johnson&#39;s biography, or at least political obituary.
Comment 567.4	Self egotistical.  Self important.  Very proud of he‚Äôs job but totally and utterly deluded and lost in himself and the past.  Vision is dead, Britain is held back.

Comment 569.2	A complete failure that got the EU to reopen the withdrawal agreement and agree a new one instead, while all of these quisling MPs insisted he was never going to do it. Now they simply refuse to vote on the deal that THEY insisted must be there before Brexit could happen. MPs change their own rules every time Boris fulfils their requirements. <br />Are you too stupid to see the con the opposition are pulling? <br />Oh wait, your a Corbyn supporter, mental illness or brain damage are requirements for that. Carry on.
Comment570	Good man.
Comment571	I want to be completely independent of Europe ,in every sense of the word , but ! I do not think the Speaker of the House should have such powers !,it smacks of an &quot;anti democratic wrangling&quot; . we need to re visit this political jumble of twists and turns and prevent this twister from weaving his web of deceit .
Comment 571.1	And here we have a typical boomer brexiteer.
Comment 571.2	@Brian kent Please dont subject us all to a show of your cognitive blindness and limited ability to reason.
Comment572	A bollocks deal
Comment 572.1	@Bladerunner Blues <br />Nope. Extension.
Comment 572.2	DANNY BOY then no deal it should be then
Comment573	Now you are for laugh for whole Europe. You lost all of your reputation Brits... How could you elect these traitors, how?
Comment 573.1	Simple, they lied at the election and promised they would carry out the wishes of the voters. We also don&#39;t have laws to stop politicians undermining the UK, because we always trusted to their sense of honour, a foolish and now out dated concept. These traitors have none.
Comment574	JOHN BERCOW is a  total wa-ker . He is totally on the side of the Remainers.  He should be dismissed from his position and any privileges revoked . He should be investigated for any possibility of any improper misconduct within his role as Speaker. <br />He needs that cheshire cat grin wiped off  his face . <br />He is an absolutely detestable man.
Comment 574.1	@catherine duffy  I don&#39;t trust him and don&#39;t trust what he says. He should be ousted immediately and not allowed to go until the 31st because he is holding up the Brexit progress .
Comment 574.2	He has already been reported for his behaviour but couldnt care less as he is leaving Oct 31st anyway. If they do manage to stop Brexit when the GE comes The Brexit Party will be voted in to get the job done
Comment575	Respect.... you kidding me! , what about the peoples vote. What about all the delay tactics ?
Comment 575.1	There is no peoples vote.

Comment 580.1	So what.<br /><br />We should have never had it!!<br /><br />Lock Cameron up, throw away the key
Comment 580.2	Literally holds up parliamentary supremacy more like.
Comment581	John Bercow is a disgrace he is a complete traitor and so biased it is unrea. He talks to foreign powers  which he&#39;s not supposed to  two is so biased about brexit it is unreal and needs to be removed from that chair forthwith
Comment582	No doubt!! Speaker is also fed up of Brexit..
Comment 582.1	We&#39;re all fed up with Brexit. Sick to the back teeth in fact. Either leave Europe or don&#39;t, just stop backbiting, bullshitting and arguing about it. Corbyn would argue with himself in the mirror, Boris would lie about his name, let&#39;s just fuck them all off.
Comment 582.2	The Speaker is not fed up, just doing his job
Comment 582.3	Good we are fed up with him!
Comment583	Remainer MP&#39;s have no honour
Comment584	Bercow rules again!<br />Nice one John!
Comment585	Love to see an independent sovereign democracy in operation.<br />You know that independent sovereign democracy leavers told us we didn&#39;t have
Comment 585.1	That group that want Britain&#39;s Parliament and courts to decide our laws and run the country and not the EU?<br />Well, they&#39;re getting what they want so why all the moaning?
Comment586	Before I wasn‚Äôt sure if he is really the best speaker of the house. After today, who will have any doubt ?
Comment 586.1	@David Hudson David.... Were going to tie you up and make you a Labour supporter üòÇ
Comment 586.2	@David Hudson His own deputy and clerks have criticised his recent decisions and conduct, as has former speaker Betty Boothroyd. Bercow is an utter disgrace.
Comment 586.3	I agree. I have no doubt. He IS NOT the best Speaker.....
Comment 586.4	@Geffo Me No, you are now just openly and blatantly full of shit. Months and months of lies from you have proven what an odious little troll you truly are. I used to think your view was at least partially based in reality and well meaning, but you have proven me utterly wrong. you are simply childish lying scum.
Comment 586.5	@C Laws By best you confirm Speaker of Common House i biased against government, judges giving judgment against government are also biased and corrupted by the EU and you have parliament who&#39;s not representing the people.<br />All you need to do is leave undemocratic EU and enjoy your democracy
Comment587	CLEAN BREAK BREXIT NOW. EVERYONE HERE IN AMERICA WANTS THE UK TO TAKE THEIR GREAT COUNTRY BACK

Comment591	Of course if any remainers on here don&#39;t like the way this country is going, feel free to move to another wonderful EU country. Very odd that people are still pouring into here. Wonder why?
Comment 591.1	The EU cartel organisation is in decline.
Comment592	Mentally unstable border line  dysphoria with obvious traits , not fit for office.

Comment596	Come on boris get us out
Comment597	Remember remember the Fifth of November.
Comment 597.1	Yeah blow this lot up
Comment598	You can check in any time you like, but you can never leave.
Comment 598.1	@anarki777 interesting. Well it definitely says Greenland is not in the eu and that is because they had a referendum  in 1982. So I wonder what deal they have then. Esp if they are part of Denmark.
Comment 598.2	@Natashahoneypot - Greenland is a part of Denmark, and Denmark is still in the EU.
Comment 598.3	@anarki777 yes just checked Greenland had a referendum in 1982. They won to leave by 52% . They left in 1985. The reason to leave was to do with fish. Fish are the main reason Norway and other northern countries stay out of the Eu. Therefore it might make sense for us to leave too esp Scottish  fish. Saying that I am vegan. I just feel sorry for the fish sucked into our politics.
Comment 598.4	Anarki77  you&#39;re soo right the EU is exactly like the hotel California., you can check<br />in anytime, but you can never leave.
Comment 598.5	U2MrPERFECT <br />You can leave whenever you want. Just give us regular cheques for ¬£39B and do as your told !! Oh ! We will need ALL your military personnel and equipment too !! üòÄ
Comment599	All I hear is: &#39;Yah-de-yah-de-yah-da-da.&#39;  Seriously, I&#39;m an intelligent bloke with a strong grasp of the Queen&#39;s English, but two minutes into the video even I&#39;m getting tired interpreting this nonsense so I can work out exactly what he&#39;s getting at.  Perhaps it&#39;s Brexit fatigue.  One has to respect American politicians, while they&#39;re just as full of bullshit as our politicians at least one doesn&#39;t have to put much effort in while listening to them.  &#39;Above all be clear,&#39; I was taught.  I guess they don&#39;t teach that at Eton, huh?
Comment600	General Election! Lets drain the swamp. We have voted. We will leave the anti democratic E.U.

Comment 606.1	So accurate
Comment 606.2	Bercow actually did a very good job explaining the reasoning behind his decision. Few politicians have that skill these days.
Comment 606.3	Eh
Comment 606.4	@Donna-Maria Welsh Not true.<br />This man will simply not allow the government to ride roughshod over the parliament. There&#39;s the bill, the amendments to the bill and the government waited until 11pm before it released a 60 page impact statement on the deal, knowing that a vote was happening at 1pm. <br />Workers rights have been completely removed from the bill. Meaning that EVERY employer in the UK can simply say &quot;We&#39;ve decided that from now on your salary is ¬£1 per year and in order to get that ¬£1 per year you have not to be absent at all and work 60 hours a week&quot;<br />The only people that want the UK to leave the EU are idiots or the incredibly rich. Which are you?
Comment607	Britain needs another King Edward I before its late.
Comment 607.1	I agree one hundred thousand percent
Comment 607.2	B. Bang. The Scots wouldnt want another one, as the first one wasn&#39;t very nice.
Comment608	Apart from Brexit, Britain should give independence to British administered Scotland, British administered Wales, British administered Ireland.
Comment 608.1	@Nimesh Poddar shut up about Kashmir<br /><br />Nobody cares.
Comment 608.2	Nimesh Poddar So they can be administered by unelected technocrats in Brussels until we get a global state and government. Our betters know better!
Comment 608.3	@Nimesh Poddar The BBC are neo liberal propaganda, who cares what they say.
Comment 608.4	@C Laws So if it was Scotland who proposed union with England it means now Scotland can&#39;t be intependent and should be tied in the UK forever?<br />Why then don&#39;t use same argument with the UK proposed to join the EU
Comment 608.5	@C Laws please give same advice to BBC. <br />KASHMIR is integral part of India .<br />Why BBC keep whining Indian administered kashmir
Comment609	Saturday&#39;s meaningful vote did NOT take place. The Speaker is determined through his dramatic performances of the last while to elevate himself to a cult hero of some sort. What could possible be more important use of today&#39;s time than the Brexit deal ?????
Comment 609.1	@Ex Essex nah not really

Comment612	At a new low Boris Johnson hates  the speaker now
Comment 612.1	@MaryHaleyKelly I&#39;m not going to talk about the USA because they are quite irrelevant.  They are not even a real country.  They are a mix-mash of different people and they don&#39;t even have their own language.  <br /><br />Focusing on Europe.  There is nothing wrong with immigrants.  But there is a problem when the immigrants want to bring in their own culture.  For any other region in the world, that would be ok, but not Europe.  Nothing that we use today would be what it is if not for the industrial revolution.  People do not understand that the world is the way it is today because of the culture that Europe adopted in the past 500-800 years.  They now try to import cultures that offer no ingenuity/innovation and no morals to Europe.  That is the problem.  They want the fruits of Europe yet they do not want to adopt the thought process that brought those results forward.  Can J. S. Bach write all those music if he was a Muslim or Chinese?
Comment 612.2	@MaryHaleyKelly Oh so you&#39;re ANTIFA. Now I can see where the bullshit is coming from.
Comment 612.3	@gregory doran I&#39;ve shown courage and bravery in the physical worls already, fighting against Neonazis in the real world more than online. If I were allowed to serve in the military I would. However I cannot due to my eyes and lungs so all I have is my mind and my words. It is funny how people always assume other people online are cowards with too much free time. But it isn&#39;t like that. Go insult someone else. I&#39;m done with you.
Comment 612.4	@Thunderstyle I&#39;m a person who is deeply opposed to another genocide. That is all.
Comment 612.5	@Jen-Yueh Hu to answer your question: the they was referring to people who follow idiots like Johnson and Trump. I thought you first response to me was concerning my comment about them earlier but it seems to have not been sent (and I don&#39;t even have AT&amp;T^^). Sorry for any confusion.
Comment613	Bloody hell, talk normally. I have to run everything this guy says through a simplification filter
Comment 613.1	@Jay Bowles Dammit!  You think you can bank on a stereotype...
Comment 613.2	@Yvonne McLay lol if he didn&#39;t speak in such a complicated way I wouldn&#39;t have to listen carefully, that&#39;s my point.
Comment 613.3	@write2pras84 I voted remain
Comment 613.4	Let me guess.  You voted to leave?
Comment614	Governed by Rats who serve Snakes not the People.
Comment615	I hate this little shit stirrer.  He is far too big for his boots.  I don&#39;t understand how they cannot get rid of him.
Comment616	to sum it up..one slap on Leavers face..yet again! <br />the Tories either May nor BJ nor JRM..are all incompetent to really bring the Brits forward..it is only a matter of time that this uk gov is the last one!<br />Scotland and N. Ireland are way better with their own future..let these Leavers fuck up their own lives and let those Remainers move on with the EU...as if the Brits would come together after brexit and believe everything is fine!?!..nothing is fine..there are no Russians..Communist forces..<br />North Koreans or even evil Germans at the british doorstep trying to get in and invade this isle!<br /><br />if these Leavers want to behave and live like Trumptards..then do it on their on demise..
Comment 616.1	@Giggitee O&#39;Yeah majority..ü§£ü§£ yeah right..go punch the moon outside..majority my arse!
Comment 616.2	What a churlish rude unsophisticated intellectual runt you are. How dare you, the minority dare declare what the majority do.
Comment 616.3	@WasRemainNowLeave really?? the EU is in a successful situation..envied by Russians.. Americans..Chinese..at the moment..<br />vast majority of EU citizens live in prosperity and secured living standards..most of these people worry where on this planet would they like to spend their holidays..which seats they want to book for the next football matches<br />..if you are successful..there are always haters everywhere!!
Comment 616.4	The EU is in a bad place  ... getting worst....
Comment617	I like how the remainers can insist that Parliament shouldn&#39;t be asked the same question twice, but that the people should be asked the same question twice. How convenient.
Comment 617.1	@mr democracy You need democracy classes: a referendum in current law is merely a consultation, it is not binding. Parliamentary laws signed by HM The Queen are binding. Every first semester in state law knows that!<br />Also, calling people who want to stay remoaners just shows your disrespect and this is just not acceptable in a factual discussion.
Comment 617.2	mr democracy try growing up: it might do you good.
Comment 617.3	Darren whyman if they agreed to a GE we could have a say they won‚Äôt to many of them heading for the dole office
Comment 617.4	@Jacob Jorgenson Yet another remoaner spin to try to justify their reasons for not respecting or simply wanting to ignore the referendum result and undermining Democracy.
Comment618	It should be noted that the speaker is absolutely right. You cannot repeat the same motion, in legal terms it would be termed frivolous or wasting a court&#39;s time. I would also point out that the referendum itself was unconstitutional in that it has been misinterpreted as conferring a mandate. It has been seen as an instruction, it has been interpreted as a &quot;people&#39;s vote&quot; - it was none of those. A referendum is advisory. Parliament not the mob is supreme. a referendum should not be used as vote of confidence (Cameron did), nor seen as a mandate (May), as a people&#39;s vote (Farage). It should be conducted with a higher level of factual content than a tabloid - in other words those in taking sides in a referendum must provide facts not lies to the referendum voters. If the preponderance of lies is greater than facts - it should be voided.  Foreign intervention of any sort should result in new referendum.
Comment 618.1	The UK has no written constitution. A referendum was advisory voted for by MPs which implies they were going to respect the result, given that they handed over the decision making to the public. Because the referendum is advisory why are remainers asking for another one?. I do agree with you on the lies, like remainers saying there&#39;s going to be World War 3, a recession, food shortages etc. What did remainers actually vote for?, to keep things the way they are or to join the Schengen area, join the EURO and the EU army?.
Comment 618.2	You speak the truth.
Comment 618.3	Well 498 MPs voted into law by triggering Article 50
Comment619	Tory clowns
Comment620	He do his job and he does it well üëèüëèüëè
Comment 620.1	No. He doesn&#39;t. <br />The Speaker is supposed to be neutral. Bercow is far from neutral.
Comment621	The House of Fools in action
Comment 621.1	INdeed. Most lower houses globally are like this, sadly.
Comment 621.2	This is what democracy looks like!<br />Asserting the sovereignty of parliament and holding the executive to account.
Comment 621.3	Not fools, just charlatans vs a would be dictator trying to get his way like a petulant child. No one is blameless. The current generation of UK politicians wether in government or not is grossly neglecting their duty of ensuring the well being of the country. As long as parliament is not passing a vote of no confidence entirely due to the personal ambition of the leader of the opposition and the inability of the the Liberal Democrats to take a calculated risk there is no way forward.
Comment 621.4	Petr ≈†macho we are not interested in your domestic arrangements.
Comment622	Bercow is making a bad name for himself
Comment 622.1	@catherine duffy that&#39;s my point he doesn&#39;t care
Comment 622.2	He leaves anyway Oct 31st plus he is a millionaire what does he care for democracy
Comment623	Well done, John Bercow.  This is a brilliant enactment of democracy as it should be and for the world to admire.  The people of this country will not be browbeaten and tricked by the likes of would-be dictators like Johnson and Mogg.
Comment 623.1	Youre deluded we voted to leave. What you re watching is a dictatorship in action.
Comment 623.2	You talk nonsense
Comment 623.3	Mate we voted leave! He knows the numbers will now get it thru so refused the vote. Democracy, unbelievable
Comment624	Lol your an idiot Bercow, Dominic Cummings has set you trap after trap, you&#39;ve walked into every one <br />Leaving with a Remainer no deal<br />Thanks lads :)
Comment625	Free ireland and scotland from the English dictatorship
Comment 625.1	Ejaja Frozarb And put them fully under Brussels technocrat rule until we get a world government and state.
Comment 625.2	Ireland should be united and independent. Scotland took a vote already, chose to betray Scottish patriots and exiles, and stayed in the UK.
Comment 625.3	@Ka Bar Brother Scotland can leave anytime she chooses to do so.<br />One more referandum will do the trick!<br />N-IRELAND dito!
Comment 625.4	Scotland had its chance, they voted to remain UK subjects.
Comment 625.5	Catalonia also wants Ireland and especially Scotland free
Comment626	"<b>Remain MPs set the standards:</b> <a href=""https://youtu.be/mHZFICg6EIE"">https://youtu.be/mHZFICg6EIE</a>"
Comment627	who is John Bercow.  God? Is he anyone that can stop anything - if he can stop anything important like continuing debate and curiosity he should be removed. and he should take his impatience some place else or take a holiday . this issue is monumental risk and should take time to evolve after 30 years it has been stable. john cameron has dissapearred,  Boris will also dissapear.  brexit is it happens will remain.
Comment628	Some likes the speaker, while some dont.
Comment 628.1	Or to put it another way. Some like the Speaker whilst some prefer honesty, integrity, impartiality, height and an understated use of the patterned tie.
Comment 628.2	Diory N useful comment, thanks for sharing your valuable insight :)
Comment629	Jacob Rees-Mogg is almost crying &amp; playing the victim as John Bercow blocked another meaning vote on Boris Johnson&#39;s Deal but the same Rees-Mogg praised John Bercow when he ruled out repeated votes on Theresa May&#39;s deal
Comment 629.1	A, my front y. Hypocrisy, hypocrisy.
Comment630	I really like John Bercow but this is just childish
Comment631	The guy is utter c..t. He should be biased towards this.
Comment632	Well France look out Britain wants to push you out of being the number one after mercal leaves the remainers here in uk if the stay in will defiantly side track you and Germany and will rule the Eu so be careful in extending the deal Britannia will rule and rule all the way you lose both ways
Comment 632.1	France already plays a shabby second fiddle to Germany since Adenauer courted the cheap French harlot Libertie and plied her drunk with ecstasy on empty flattery. It has been German foreign policy since Bismarck to deny the French the opportunity to do anything but have the le petit strutting cock contained to its own Gallic dungheap.
Comment 632.2	What the hell?!??
Comment633	John &#39; I have friends in Brussels&#39; Bercow.
Comment634	What a load of Shite. History won&#39;t look back with respect for these shower of morons. Vote on the deal or no deal.. Thats your Fukin options.
Comment635	If Bercow allowed the vote, then maybe he would be called a brexiteer. If he blocks it, hes a remainer. Looking off the results on saturday, it makes sense for this vote to be delayed until the legislation that was agreed upon on saturday comes in effect.<br /><br /><br />All this is a result of the fact that there is no majority. The only majority and unity in government right now is the united front to block Boris. Everything Boris has tried, parliament finds a way to dance around it. <br /><br /><br />But once you remove Boris, there is no majority. <br />There is not enough remainers to force a second referendum.<br />Theres not enough no dealers to force a no deal brexit.<br />Even if Labour came into power, it would only be a repeat of what is happening now as labour is divided between remainers and leavers.<br />And frankly, theres not enough Boris&#39;ers to vote for his deal.<br /><br /><br />Theres just no majority. Even the option that wins the most vote wont win because it needs to adhere to the regulations of achieving the majority.
Comment 635.1	You leave by default on wto if no deal is made so looking good so far. A vote wont be needed to default to wto its automatic under Article 50
Comment636	Essentially, to protect the integrity and significance of decisions made by Parliament, no motion can be discussed more than once within a single parliamentary session unless it is substantially and meaningfully different or presented in substantially and meaningfully different circumstances.<br /><br />This was not a politically motivated ruling. This ruling was simply to protect the importance and significance of parliamentary decision making. It is literally written into the rules of parliament and definitively the correct course of action.
Comment 636.1	@Ahsim Nreiziev Unfortunately though i don&#39;t disagree with the thought behind your comment, Guy Verhofstadt himself publically called Johnson a traitor just earlier this month in response to him calling the Benn Act the Surrender Act. He&#39;s also not the first in the senior EU team to use such language and insinuation throughout this process.
Comment 636.2	@mogznwaz Boris Johnson&#39;s bill was approved for vote. He&#39;s the one that withdrew it, which can&#39;t be Bercow&#39;s fault if it can&#39;t be put forwards again in this session as he is just following important parliamentary procedure. He should have had the vote on Saturday. Now he will have to wait for important amendments to the bill so that the Speaker can justify it is substantially/meaningfully different enough to put forwards. This is likely to include a customs union ammendment with the provision that the government&#39;s deal be put forwards to the people in a confirmatory vote, as the public have not been given the option to &quot;seal the deal&quot; on any particular form of Brexit so to speak: they only got to say whether they would like to Leave or Remain. Johnson&#39;s own fault but at the end of the day it&#39;s definitely for the best and 100% the democratic thing.
Comment 636.3	@Geffo Me I&#39;m pretty sure that if Remain had won and leavers were pulling these shenanigans to force us out of the EU you would feel very differently about this. I voted Remain btw but I have empathy with Leavers and I understand their anger.  Remainers have acted disgracefully in my opinion.
Comment 636.4	I have to disagree. Theresa May&#39;s deal was put forward 3 times with no discernible change. Boris&#39;s bill hasn&#39;t had a single vote yet. This is  political game playing, nothing more.
Comment 636.5	@James Sempy <br />Is the commission, headed by <br />Sir Bernard Jenkins,<br />&quot;Shutting the stable door <br />AFTER the horse has bolted!&quot;<br /><br />Far too late !<br />The Speaker is resigning on Thursday, 31/10/2019.<br /><br />It is not possible to &quot;undo/reverse&quot; his <br />pro EU BIAS decisions.<br /><br />Bercow has a dazzling future in The USA,<br />making MILLIONS.<br /><br />Why should HE care ?
Comment637	Can&#39;t do it today because it would be repetitive,  what a joke of a man.
Comment638	I LIKE THIS GUY....BERCOW FOR PM
Comment639	The deal isn&#39;t submitted last week so under what basis he deny it a second precedings? The parliement stalling tactics disgust me
Comment 639.1	Bercow is speaker for opposition. Not COMMONS as whole. Last week his secret visit to EU offices was a clear indication that he has been paid off.
Comment 639.2	So you think that the speaker of the house would just say it was presented and lie?   Were you not paying attention the past 4 days?
Comment640	Parliament against the people and what does it say in our unwritten Constitution it says that if the government is against the people that people have a right to take the government out of Parliament
Comment 640.1	Parliament is the people.
Comment 640.2	Poppet how stupid
Comment641	A disgrace.
Comment 641.1	üç©
Comment642	Parliament refusing to allow an election, and now refusing a vote on a major agreement between UK and EU is borderline Treason. This is going to really agitate voters. I suspect Jeremy Corbyin&#39;s career is over at this point. When things finally fall apart and there&#39;s an election, it&#39;s not going to go well for the Remainers, these are underhanded tactics.
Comment 642.1	What else to expect of the Remainers but the underhanded? These are dishonourable people, people who have sold their very souls to the devil- money.
Comment 642.2	James There must be a revenge at the polls in the next election. Vote them out!
Comment 642.3	Oh yeah because it&#39;s going sooo well for the Brexiteers
Comment 642.4	James go fuck your self
Comment643	Seeing as how Johnson has applied for an extension, it would make sense to wait for the EU&#39;s verdict before voting on his deal.
Comment 643.1	@AiiNZ I&#39;d be happy to agree with that were certain criteria fulfilled  and a final vote on the matter was given because I distinctly remember, that the referendum was fought on a nationalist pedestal. I have no gripes with nationalism per see. I do however have a problem with racism, and that is exactly what the end of the referendum was about. I believe it was Oswald Mosley who claimed, &quot;If you a nationalist you care for your nation, if you are socialist you care for the people.&quot; <br /><br /><br />Even this most horrendous of racists understood the difference between the two. The problem with the tory party nowadays is that they have a bunch of neo-nazis hanging on their every breath. Thatcher was wrong when she said society is dead. This problem proves that. <br /><br /><br />Clearly the only people who can heal the country are those who are nationalist and have the interests of society at heart.
Comment 643.2	@Cars Rich People Drive I hope you guys do proceed with Brexit because the EU has been using the UK as a milk cow for far to long, it&#39;s time for yous to take back democracy and finally be independent
Comment 643.3	@AiiNZ That is awful. It must be heartbreaking for you to learn that we have a prime minister who one day says there will be no border and the next day he says there will. I can only imagine the powers that be in Northern Ireland are listening to Boris Johnson very carefully.
Comment 643.4	@Cars Rich People Drive very true indeed my friend , I don&#39;t want there being a border between North and South I unfortunately lost my grandad to the troubles, he worked as a delivery driver and on the day of his death he was escorting goods from Dublin to Belfast and he stopped by at a petrol station and my grandad was unfortunately caught up in the bombing , The troubles loom in Ireland again a lot of conflict and tension is already happening this Brexit could possibly ruin irish society for the next hundreds of years
Comment 643.5	@AiiNZ I&#39;m afraid that was all part of the tory plan. It&#39;s called shock politics. The premise being that they create a mess and then own the mess by creating their way out of it. In that process, all things that tories don&#39;t like are abandoned. You know, things like your right to have a holiday, your right to work reasonable hours for a reasonable wage, your right to clean rivers unpolluted by scurrilous business owners, your right to protest, you right to......... an so on and so forth. It is in the tory party&#39;s interest that we leave with no deal. The bigger the mess, the more they can change.

Comment 644.3	Cockney translation=keep your trap shut you string vest
Comment 644.4	NekoWinters he actually said ‚Äúbear stoically with fortitude‚Äù*, which basically means to be calm despite your strong feelings.

Comment646	"<b>Remainer MPs set the standards:</b> <a href=""https://youtu.be/mHZFICg6EIE"">https://youtu.be/mHZFICg6EIE</a>"
Comment647	&quot;... to ensure the sensible use of the house&#39;s time, and proper respect for the decisions that it takes.&quot;<br />What about a sensible use of the UK&#39;s time, and proper respect for the decision of the referendum? What can possibly be more important to vote on now, than the deal? That is an incredibly biased decision, whether Bercow sees it or not.<br /><br />How do our MPs sit in parliament, elected on a manifesto to honour the result of the referendum, after they overwhelmingly voted to trigger article 50, with a straight face? They won&#39;t vote for a soft Brexit with May&#39;s deal, they won&#39;t vote for a moderate Brexit with Johnson&#39;s deal, they won&#39;t vote for no deal, and they won&#39;t vote for a general election to let the people decide. It&#39;s a mockery of our democracy and our country, that the minority can outright refuse to let the largest democratic exercise in the history of the UK pass. Parliament does not represent the people, and they have no mandate to be there. Stop wasting our time.
Comment 647.1	Good talk
Comment 647.2	Rogue parliament obeying its eu masters. I dont like the deal anyway and much prefer leaving by default on wto.on Oct 31st that way its a clean break.
Comment648	Oh well, maybe there&#39;ll be no deal then, clean break brexit. Biased Bercow will be gone soon too.
Comment 648.1	He&#39;s only &#39;biased&#39; because you don&#39;t happen to agree with his conclusion.<br />Had there been another vote today, Monday, there is no reason to suppose the result would likely to have been exactly the same as Saturday!
Comment 648.2	No Deal then a general election immediately would be best now i think. That will get Brexit negotiated properly by a people represented parliment. Boris&#39;s deal is very bad anyway it would be worse if that passed. In a way Bercow has made no deal even more likely i just hope someone vitos it or this will carry on.
Comment649	All this is a bunch of jibbish to me

Comment 651.4	It became a dictatorship the second we won the referendum to leave. They were never going to let us leave on either terms. They&#39;re absolute vermin, mate.
Comment 651.5	Matt chew you are a moron if you don&#39;t
Comment652	Boris asking for another vote for the same deal is the same as asking for another referendum. But he opposes that? Agendas
Comment 652.1	He didnt get a vote on Saturday. It hadnt been put to a vote. People have no idea what they are talking about.
Comment653	Berkow&#39;s dictatorship...didn&#39;t we vote these entitled elites to do as their constituency wanted, not to follow their own exclusive agendas?? Get rid of the lot of &#39;em, make them get real jobs &amp; work for a living!!üëéüëé
Comment654	After Brexit is complete and Boris and Juncker&#39;s deal goes through, can we please export John Bercow to Brussels - he&#39;ll be much happier as a central figure in the European Superstate Project with Guy Verhofstadt and and Philippe Lamberts
Comment 654.1	@stop Mass Hysteria I cant say I&#39;m happy with everything that goes with by joining the EU but over all I believe it&#39;s a good thing been a member of the EU. I understand might think different but that&#39;s just my opinion.<br />The Leave campaign lied. They made it out that if the UK left the EU they could spend the billions they give to the EU on the NHS. It was all lies. <br />What about all the British people who retired to a foreign country? <br />There is much uncertainty around all of this and it should be done correct.<br />I stand by the democratic vote of the British people but it was done on lies told to the British people and politicians playing a game  trying to move up the ladder in their own party. Boris was against leaving the EU but he when the PM was for staying in Europe Boris changed his mind to leave. It&#39;s all a game to them. This isn&#39;t a game. Peoples livelihoods are at stake.
Comment 654.2	It was only discussed on Saturday not voted on. Hopefully we may now leave by default on wto which is far better than that crappy deal.
Comment 654.3	Tony just because he‚Äôs not calling it your way. Grow up!
Comment 654.4	@Irish 1916 your YouTube name is ironic. Ireland fought for independence for hundreds of years and achieved it yet you would prefer to have unelected old men in Brussels make your laws

All you Remainers who are gloating at your success in frustrating the will of 17.4 million people who won a fair referendum should be ashamed of yourselves.

Comment656	Lib Dems said they wouldn&#39;t accept a second vote if Brexit won. So why should we Brexiters want a vote?.
Comment 656.1	Mr Heidelberg they shouldn‚Äôt have said that, I think they are only gunning for a second referendum because it is very likely to be remain. Otherwise, you can just use the best interests vs want argument and claim it‚Äôs objectively wrong so shouldn‚Äôt happen regardless, which I agree with, but wouldn‚Äôt result in a vote

Comment659	Language can be used to communicate or to DECEIVE.<br /> With this parliament it&#39;s the latter.<br /><br />I have at least some education ( 2  university degrees at 2.1.)<br />However, watching Parliament today I feel I have stumbled on a weird, incomprehensible sub-culture.<br />WHAT  THE HELL ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?<br />If it doesn&#39;t make sense then it is NONSENSE. <br /> The speaker is so up himself, and the MPs<br />may as well come from another planet.
Comment660	Me: Leaving..<br /><br />Also me:
Comment 660.1	Rick Martin know what you mean,three and a half years to get it done,that‚Äôs my problem,they ,the Tories and to be fair Labour,are useless...god help the country.
Comment 660.2	@Paul Ritchie Or if you can, then can we also have a second referendum 3 years after the other one?
Comment 660.3	Are we there yet...are we there yet...you can‚Äôt have the same bill two days after it was defeated..ha ha ..
Comment661	Conservatives are funny. They complain about the EU stealing the power of the national government. Then they complain about the national government (parliament) for following national laws. Why can¬¥t you conservatives just admit you only like things when they are your way ?

Comment 661.2	@catherine duffy Oh, finally...a good old conspiracy theorist...I was missing your kind
Comment 661.3	You re deluded. There hasnt already been a vote. The speaker is obeying his eu masters who want a  rigged 2nd referendum. Its called a dictstorship

Comment 663.2	He&#39;s kosher.
Comment664	Haha all these people in distress after this vote, meanwhile the Forex traders sell the pound and profit from its downfall..
Comment 664.1	Giggitee O&#39;Yeah That is correct however I see no relation of it to my initial comment. I wasn‚Äôt insinuating that a weak pound is good or bad.
Comment 664.2	the value of the pound is not indicative of anything. A weak pound is good for British exporters but bad for British importers. The variance is below 20%, UK is relatively financially stable, manageable GDP to debt ration- anything claiming the contrary is merely scaremongering.
Comment 664.3	Titus Bett Well let‚Äôs see how it plays out, especially after the 31st of October.
Comment 664.4	Not really. Infact it&#39;s stuck @1.29700 it&#39;s volatile
Comment665	Alright. Who&#39;s side should I be with now?  52% and 48% seems almost polarizing to me
Comment 665.1	@mogznwaz &#39;Perfectly fine&#39; is a major overstatement.<br /><br />Brexit as it is now proposed will make us all financially worse off; that&#39;s a fact. We&#39;ll have fewer practical opportunities, and are likely to also be worse off under Johnson&#39;s deal in matters of the NHS, rights and environment.<br /><br />Also, this Conservative government hasn&#39;t produced any credible proposals for managing immigration in a way that&#39;s compatible with our society&#39;s needs; they&#39;ve just said they&#39;ll deny entry to anyone we don&#39;t need, which is virtually nobody new.<br /><br />I can only see Brexit as causing problems, not fixing them. And there are plenty of people, many of whom voted for Brexit, who can&#39;t afford more problems right now. <br /><br />Will the country survive? Yes, in some form. But it won&#39;t be any more perfectly fine than you would expect someone with a bad lawyer to be after a long and angry divorce and custody battle.
Comment 665.2	@rtozier2011 theyre the reasons to leave
Comment 665.3	@mogznwaz All deals are leaving, including EEA membership. It&#39;s my opinion that all deals (especially no deal) are worse than actually remaining, but I would still leave if people voted now to accept a deal rather than remain. That wouldn&#39;t be a rigged vote.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks that no party is offering a hard enough Brexit for them is welcome to form a new party and advocate that at a general election.
Comment 665.4	@rtozier2011 Unless the &#39;deal&#39; to leave isn&#39;t really leaving at all and is worse than actually remaining. Hardly fair.  It&#39;s a rigged vote in effect.
Comment 665.5	@rtozier2011 A failure of our terrible politicians does not make leaving the EU the wrong choice or make the referendum result null and void. Remainers have tried to stall, slander and obfuscate for 3 years. If that&#39;s the way to overturn democracy expect retaliation in future - 2 can play that game. Is that what you want? No. In a democracy you accept results you don&#39;t like, they are implemented and then you can campaign to change things at a later date.  Leaving the EU is not armageddon,  even Tony Blair a d David Cameron admitted we&#39;ll be perfectly fine.

Comment 669.1	@Seer Seerwealth If we do not break free of the EU now then I believe the UK is finished, the only light at the end of the tunnel is that the EU will also be finished soon, what that train wreck will deliver cannot really be imagined as you say live day to day forget about returning sanity to the UK and emigrate if possible.
Comment 669.2	"@Roger Bennett <br />You have touched on the sore spot for many intellectually challenged. Those who learned a history know-how BABYLON <a href=""http://ebded.uk/"">EBDED.UK</a> lost BRITISHNESS, NATIONAL PRIDE and Will to resolve OWN issues. If things will not DRASTICALLY change back, we have reached in the UK as KINGDON the END of ROAD. EU implanted too many snitches in UK and collaborators with their 4th REICH EU dream EMPIRE. What bombs failed to achieve<br />dirty backhand payments will.  In this beautiful country CORRUPTION is 75%. Rest complacent, lazy, surrenders and wimps. Better not to know the future. Live day by day.<br />When SHTF some will cope, millions not. Be Blessed."
Comment 669.3	@Seer Seerwealth Most surprisingly many British people disagree with you, admittedly the stock has been weakened with an insanely large influx of foreign races yet so many seem to think the EU is a roaring success denying the evidence in front of them! People dying in lorry containers or the British channel, multi cultural chaos and an abdication of western responsibility to run the world as was proven to be the most beneficial way by the British Empire with Christian values, we have generally speaking gone backwards for the last 50 yrs reversing this is going to be difficult but recognising the problem is a start.
Comment670	Anti Brexit throughout.<br />Get rid of this undemocratic twerp!
Comment 670.1	‚Äã@nowtleft2 I cannot do anything to stop you from living your life as you please: if that is what is meant by respecting your choice, then I concur. <br /><br />If respecting your choice means that I will let you get away with spewing falsehoods and appalling sentiments in a public forum, then no: I do not respect your opinions nor your views. Given our exchanges, I have little hope of changing your mind. I will always try to talk to those with differing views to learn from them. If however your worldview is based on statements about reality you cannot hope to back up and a not so subtle appeal to racism, then I hope that others can continue the conversation and that we can find common ground and a way of going forward. . I can only hope you change your mind and are not further entrenched in your narrow-minded worldview. <br /><br />As a common courtesy: good luck on your travels and future endeavours.
Comment 670.2	As a tax payer I will get all that. My Workd is outside of the EU and our crazy UK which is more like living in the 3rd World due to immigrants flooding in.<br />If our people are anti democracy and want a flood of immigrants who are gypsies and lazy breeders then I will do what is right for me.<br />While we still have a choice you should respect mine.

Comment 670.5	@nowtleft2 you have shares in a billionaire&#39;s firm that&#39;s partially built on tax evasion and think that &#39;the people&#39; know better than experts who have dedicated years of their lives to studying the subject matter. &#39;doing business&#39; and navigating the international realm are not the same. How does a background in business prepare you for international law, fiscal- and monetary policy, diplomatic relations, climate science, etc?<br /><br />I&#39;ll grant you that I don&#39;t think the UK has a system in place that always puts the best and brightest in power (I think this has more to do with your district and de facto two party system than the quality of your universities). The fact of the matter is that for most things in life that are hard, you bring in an expert: you go to a medical doctor for your health, you go to a lawyer when you&#39;re summoned in court. But no, I&#39;m sure John Doe down the street knows and understands the intricacies of European politics.

Comment 672.2	James it must be nice to just say any old bullshit and present it as a fact.
Comment 672.3	@James no the Speaker is following the traditional rule of Parliament since 1763. No one can bring the same motion again to vote, straight after the one before.
Comment 672.4	@James He quite literally spoke for several minutes, in great detail, about the rule/law/convention which prevents Johnson&#39;s motion from coming to the house again so quickly. If he was making it up to deliberately ruin Tory bills, do you really think he would still hold that position? Come on man.

Comment676	So what does this mean again?<br />My Ancient English dialogue is outdated I&#39;m afraid.
Comment 676.1	Th issue was voted on on Saturday - in the time since then and now, there has been no substantive change to the issue the government wish to vote on again, so Bercow has decided not to hold another vote, as it would be a repetition and effectively waste Parliament&#39;s time.
Comment 676.2	Hitherto thine House of Common hath proclaimed its denunciation of the Queen&#39;s liege&#39;s pledge with the Roman mainland , therefore let there be no further discourse on the matter, lest it be dreary and redundant
Comment 676.3	It means there is going to be no horse manure deal and no extension and Britain leaves the EU with a clean break on the 31st. Unless there are further shenanigans by the undemocratic political class, which there will be
Comment 676.4	OceanBlue Heart<br /><br />The government requested that the house vote on Boris‚Äô Brexit deal, and this was declined by the chair (Bercow) because that ‚Äòmotion‚Äô had already been discussed and deferred to a later date by the house in an earlier sitting. Essentially Bercow is saying that it is not good parliamentary process to discuss or scrutinise or vote on the same issue more than once unless the circumstances surrounding a motion or the actual ‚Äòsubstance‚Äô (implications) of the motion have changed. Bercow explains in his statement that the substance of the motion is the same and the circumstances have not changed (since it‚Äôs only been a few days). The idea is that it would be a waste of parliamentary time to table more than once a motion that is not different to a previous motion, in circumstances that are not different to when that motion was previously tabled.<br /><br />The house already informed the government that it wants Johnson to ask for an extension rather than voting on his ‚Äòdeal‚Äô, thereby making the tabling of a vote for that deal rather pointless.
Comment 676.5	This means this tory clowns can t do what they want<br />This brexit is stupid and all conseguences are bad
Comment677	Naive question from the US: If Parliament  cannot vote on the same thing twice, why do some insist on the UK as a whole doing so?
Comment 677.1	@Malcolm Speyer  We all know implications of leave vote were not clarified that means nothing as the vote was a straight choice between remain or leave that&#39;s what people voted on and the people chose leave.  It&#39;s called democracy just like when nobody in Scotland ever voted for a Margaret Thatcher goverment but we had to accept the decision and all the implications.
Comment 677.2	The parliament cannot because circumstances have not changed from saturday. However, referendum for brexit was on 2016, and now we are on 2019. Three years, I am quite sure people could change their minds, in particular, considering the events that brexit has raised during this period of time.
Comment 677.3	It can just not in the same parliamentary session. It is to prevent wasting the time of parliament and MPs.<br /><br />Brexit is a process that has taken years, where the implications of leave vote were not clarified.<br /><br />It is like layers making a business deal on behalf of a third party. Intermediaries/legal experts work out the details then present the deal back to the host companies. <br /><br />They then then get the choice to agree to the deal struck, go back to negotiations, or give up on the deal.<br /><br />Why shouldn&#39;t the people get that same right to scrutinize the details of a brexit deal before signing on the dotted line.
Comment 677.4	The extension request that boris made to the EU wasn&#39;t a significant enough change in circumstances after the initial vote to warrent another vote. But for a second referendum you could argue that there is a significant enough reason for the public to have changed their opinion as some argue they were lied to when informed about what would happen if we left and what wouldn&#39;t before the vote, but also people feel like the government will not handle to the leave like they said they would and people don&#39;t want to leave if its in the manner in might be done now. I think that&#39;s the reason as far as I understand

Comment 684.2	Thank god you Leaver scum need put in your place!
Comment685	The Speaker is an avowed remainer who has misused his chair to undermine the will of the people. The UK needs to hold a general election ASAP.
Comment686	Well we know that, the proceeding is the same we already had. It‚Äôs the same amendment, that was put on hold till legislation is done. So he is just doing his job, for those who think he is doing it, because he is biased. He would be if he don‚Äôt do it.
Comment 686.1	If I recall correctly not all three votes on May&#39;s deal was done in 72 hours of each over. Maybe if the Prime Minister starts paying attention instead of trying to be no man&#39;s hero Brexit can get done
Comment 686.2	GEJ it‚Äôs not about the vote (it was never voted on in it) it was the amendment that the treaty has to put into law before they vote on it, that was voted on on Saturday and they wanted to redo this amendment today. So the letter to the EU has nothing to do with it, because it doesn‚Äôt change this amendment. He should not have allowed the withdrawal a second time (he did cause of the importance and promises to the the withdrawal, knowing better), but he stopped it the 3rd time so they had at least change the political declaration, to bring it once again. Actually u can‚Äôt redo this because a amendment made in the same sitting has to be respected and not redone. Except there are new circumstances to reconsider it since 1604.
Comment 686.3	I dont think the circumstances has changed enough. That letter wasn&#39;t submitted by the government, but was forced to sent by Johnson to the EU by the Benn Act, and there has been no reply other than &quot;We&#39;ll consider it&quot;. So I think the context remained largely the same
Comment 686.4	Was there not three votes on Theresa May&#39;s deal?<br />Also, the fact that the government has submitted an extension request to the EU does change the context in which the Withdrawal Agreement is being put forth.
Comment687	can someone that speaks British parliament lingo translate this to plain english ?

Comment 687.2	.....more obstruction of the deal that Boris has managed to get however, the majority of the traitor&#39;s in the Commons are arch Remainer&#39;s and determined to revoke article 50 and kill the Brexit referendum result dead. We can only solve this now with a General Election ......Bercow is acting like a mediaeval aristocrat .
Comment 687.3	if i may. The key phrase is &quot;implementing legislation is passed&quot;. parliament voted 48 hours ago, that the legislation must first be discussed and materialised until any decision on brexit can be made. So, therefore decision on brexit cannot be made now.
Comment 687.4	@Andrew Bowman This is not the &#39;translation&#39;. The &#39;Speaker of the House&#39; is the person who&#39;s job it is to manage parliamentary process. He&#39;s appointed by the majority but supposed to be like an impartial &#39;referee&#39;. He&#39;s not supposed to interfere, but rather facilitate.
Comment 687.5	Bollox, better?
Comment688	So they have to vote twice on a &#39;meaningful&#39; vote, according to the Conservatives, but not twice on a really &#39;meaningful&#39; referendum?

Comment 690.3	Unlib undem you mean. You sound a good fit for that party of dictators.
Comment691	John Bercow is doing the people‚Äôs work. I say that as someone who voted for Brexit, not because of immigration, not for ¬£350m a week but for democracy. Speaker Bercow has ensured that we the people will be in control of Brexit, the MPs have a huge role in Brexit now. So I say to you, in the upcoming general election, vote for who‚Äôs vision of Britain you would like to see post Brexit. If you‚Äôd like employment rights, human rights, equality, a fully funded NHS, a national rail service and investment in infrastructure then vote labour. If you‚Äôd like low taxes if you make lots of money, less spending on healthcare, less spending on the police force then vote for the tories. If you don‚Äôt want Brexit vote for lib real democrats, if you want Britain to become Eco friendly, vote Green. For the first time in recent history we now have Clear alternatives.
Comment 691.1	@Zepher Gaming labour are doing everything they can to stop Brexit so stop talking shite, god knows what that other waffle was about but it was also wrong, capiche?
Comment 691.2	Stu Morris They are not ignoring the referendum result, labour are not the government mate, they are the opposition, if all the tories and the DUP MPs voted the way they should then Brexit would have happened a long time ago. Labour are just not willing to accept this sham of a deal.
Comment 691.3	Stu Morris I‚Äôll tell you the real problem Stu, it isn‚Äôt immigrants, it isn‚Äôt gays, it isn‚Äôt Muslims, it isn‚Äôt blacks, it isn‚Äôt whites, it isn‚Äôt young people, it isn‚Äôt old people, it isn‚Äôt transgender people, it isn‚Äôt lesbians nor bisexuals. It‚Äôs the idiots in charge Stu, if you want the country to change in the way you want it to change, then educate yourself and put your message out there.
Comment 691.4	Stu Morris Mate we live in a different world nowadays, You May say Cameron is a liberal, but in reality he is a blue blooded Tory but he‚Äôs accepted modern society has changed from 30/40 years ago. I‚Äôm sorry mate but the truth is the older generations backward mentality and inability to accept change is what is stifling this country. It will never go back to how it was back then. Abortion, gay rights and freedoms for ethnic minorities are all things which are now engrained into British society, whether you like it or not.
Comment 691.5	@Zepher Gaming Yeah they are ignoring the result, they want another referendum, they lied in 2017 etc etc
Comment692	It makes sense in a way, as you can&#39;t vote for the same thing every day without a single  change
Comment 692.1	@richard buckwell that was not my point. My point is Brexit isn&#39;t working because it can&#39;t work and stay as good as we are now.
Comment 692.2	klonoalunar correct and we should have left already

Comment694	One cannot but admire the use of the English language and the very cogent and thoughtful analysis of the complex situation. <br />A most even handed and careful decision. Well done, sir!
Comment 694.1	@James I get the distinct impression, that as you don&#39;t agree with Bercow&#39;s assessment of the current situation.<br />Had he allowed a debate again, I&#39;m sure you would have applauded his opinion as being &#39;bang on the money&#39;!<br />I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that Bercow was/is a Conservative MP and that he is the second longest serving Speaker since 1943!<br />No mean accomplishment by anyone&#39;s judgement!!

Comment 694.3	Complexity is often deception.

Comment 698.1	Thank you very much ‚úîÔ∏è
Comment699	Essentially a deal was reached with the EU and this man will not allow anyone to vote on it. Absolutely disgraceful.
Comment 699.1	@Adam In the long term, democracy will get broken as social media makes us more divided and destroys any notion of truth. I&#39;m a strong supporter of just handing ownership back to the monarchy. However, instead of a single monarch at top, there should be a few close family members, perhaps five, with equal voting right. When one dies (or is voted out by the 4 others), they get to decide on who takes his or her place. <br /><br /><br />Each 4th year the public gets to vote on whether to toss the current monarchs and begin the process of electing new ones, but that requires something like a 70 pct majority, so people <i>really</i> needs to be pissed. This avoids both blatant corruption and populism. There are still risks and downsides, but they&#39;re much smaller than the current system. The monarchs have a vested interest in keeping a happy population for not just themselves, but also their children who will take over after them and are taught from a young age in all the necessary skills.
Comment 699.2	@Michael M That&#39;s the point. The public know nothing about matters such as this. We shouldn&#39;t have been trusted in the first place.
Comment 699.3	@Mylo Archer The problem is that there is no clear majority for ANY specific brexit solution. Not in the population and not in their representatives. The more democratic choice would be to not just ask the people if they want the deal, but also whether they want to crash out or remain IF the deal doesn&#39;t get a majority. This way you avoid splitting the leave votes, while still getting a final decision.
Comment 699.4	I just happen to think that in the interests of progressing this matter, it&#39;s a good idea to actually get an open vote on the deal Mr Johnson has reached with EU. The speakers action in blocking this is not helpful. The end goal surely is to resolve this situation, blocking open votes seems counterproductive to the process regardless of potential outcomes. These people mostly seem entirely focused upon securing their ability to hold endless debates between one another to no end and with no possibility compromise.  My concern beyond the entire brexit issue is the damage this parliament it&#39;s doing to the parliamentary system and the British people&#39;s confidence in UK democracy. As thing&#39;s stand the UK risks being ruled by lawyers..
Comment 699.5	@Adam If three simple questions are far too complicated for a person, then they&#39;re hardly qualified for complex international decisions that will have a massive impact on the future of millions of people and their children. What would the actual downside of posing it this way be? The downside of just asking &quot;leave or remain&quot; is that the leave side gets (more) pissed if the alternatives haven&#39;t been disproven first and if leave wins, we&#39;ll spend the next six billion years discussing what it means.

Comment701	That&#39;s a blow to Meaningful Vote (MV) 16 but we can all look forward to many more !!
Comment702	so to summarize bercow seems glad that the deal did not go through LOL
Comment 702.1	we needed referendum
Comment 702.2	üòÇ Basically
Comment703	The only good news is that, BBC so busy with Brexit there is no Muslims bashing on UK media as headlines. After Brexit what would be heading or breaking news?
Comment 703.1	Muslims trying to play the victim lol .
Comment 703.2	well they wont be able to blame EU migrants so any 1 not english is not going to have a fun time down south
Comment704	This man should be prosecuted for treason and abuses of his position.
Comment 704.1	Taylan Oran treason is subjective.  There is much that is broke with Britain right now.
Comment 704.2	You are correct. Boris abuses  his position. He lies to the queen and to the supreme court. He uses proroguation as a political tool. If he loses a vote, he demands a re-vote a few days later even though nothing has changed. And he&#39;s such a compulsive liar, that he seriously tries to convince a man that the press is not there, while he&#39;s being filmed by a ton of camera men just a few meters away. He also promised the people that Britain would stay in the single market and now does everything to achieve the exact opposite even though there is a clear majority against it.
Comment 704.3	Could you explain why this is treason?
Comment705	üòÉgoodüëç now ORDER üòÇ
Comment706	John Bercow has been a remoaner from the beginning. No impartiality, no neutrality. He&#39;s everything a speaker is <b>NOT</b> supposed to be. Politics has always been rife with corruption, but hopefully Brexit will wake up the rest of the sheep that democracy is an absolute illusion. The media like the BBC have also been hugely exposed for their propaganda.
Comment 706.1	@Darran Chan Good Im pleased we can just leave on wto on Oct 31st. It doesnt require a vote
Comment 706.2	@Darran Chan Astutely correct summing up of the situation. Can you provide a redraft in Murdoch speak so the gullible can understand?
Comment 706.3	<b>Brexiters:</b> It&#39;s basically treason to vote on the same thing, even though the original vote was clearly based entirely on lies, we had no idea of what it actually meant and it happened 3 election cycles ago.<br /><b>Also brexiters:</b> It&#39;s basically treason if the government can&#39;t force MP&#39;s to vote for the same thing they just voted for a few days ago, even though absolutely nothing has changed.
Comment 706.4	Even if it was allowed by the speaker, the result will be the same as saturday. Yes bercow might not be as neutral as he should be, but the blocking of the vote today is a result of what happened on saturday. Until the legislation that was proposed on saturday by parliament has been finalised, it would not be appropriate to vote on a deal as on saturday they already said that they wont vote until the delay legislation has passed. <br /><br />Fact of the matter is, this is what happens when you dont have a majority. May lost her majority government. DUP and other Tories are rebelling against Boris. If Boris managed to get a snap election, perhaps he could have reclaimed his majority again. But that opportunity got blocked by the opposition.<br /><br />Credits to both parties as each one are doing good tactics to try and win. But sadly, there is no win, only stalemates. Opposition wont win a majority government so theyre betting on delaying brexit and trying to be voted in as government. But even then, labour has division within themsalves. It will just be a repeat of what is happening now. <br /><br />If no dealers, backed Boris&#39; deal, then maybe Boris&#39; deal would win a majority. Boris is betting on winning the support of his own party and within the Tories are many divisions.<br /><br /><br />Conclusion, this could have been prevented if May did not call a snap election... But again, credits to May as she took a gamble that didnt work in her favour.
Comment 706.5	what about the 17.4 million vote u forgot to metion that usall shite u wank stain
Comment707	It hardly matters given they&#39;ll vote soon enough on the real bill, but symbolically it is.
Comment 707.1	It matters because it&#39;s proper democratic procedure. If the deal gets scrutinised, opened up to amendments, and then passed without a referendum, we&#39;ll democratically leave.
Comment708	He&#39;s a remainder through and through<br />Orrrrdeeerr<br />650 Stella artoirs please barman
Comment 708.1	Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Comment709	good stuff!!
Comment 709.1	Only one time in life time
