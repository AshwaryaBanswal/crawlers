Comment1	Even the high IQ Asians are joining the bash whitey party!
Comment2	Britain left every place it went a better place. Don&#39;t call it the greatest empire that ever was for nothing ;-)<br /> Poor uneducated people protest about literally any old nonsense.<br /> The historical representation is inaccurate. Calling this dick an artist is also inaccurate.
Comment3	Typical immature thinking.
Comment4	Why does the bbc keep pushing a left anti british opinion.<br />I will not be made to feel guilty for being british, for something our country did hundreds of years ago.<br />We were also the first country to ban slavery but I don’t see the bbc spreading this.<br />What matters is the actions of our country now and not what was done in the past by a society that was not as well educated on humanity as it is now.<br />This guilt trip culture is pathetic!
Comment5	The British colonies are in the situation they are in despite the British and not because of them.What you think or what you are taught about your colonizing ancestors is irrelevant and will not change the truth.
Comment6	Singapore country is very beautiful
Comment7	His artwork looks like shit.
Comment8	Good.
Comment9	This is barely news-worthy for Singapore itself, let alone the world. The only worth in this report is as anti-white/anti-capitalism propaganda, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re seeing it here.
Comment10	yeah we roamed the planet stealing and raping the shit out of everything and everyone that were weaker than us, but we did some cool stuff too; like doubling lifespans, and  a whole bunch of other good stuff - old news
Comment11	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpDVnh_06WI&amp;t=0m53s"">0:53</a> <b>T H I C C</b>"
Comment12	You know people if the BBC were to instead report on the glory of the Empire and how they brought advancements to their colonies around the world they&#39;d still be shat upon for glorifying colonial killers of native indigenous people which they are though!<br /><br />Left wingers, right wingers, just fight each other in person in the streets. I just... can&#39;t.
Comment13	its another way to make make money out of history and to make himself famous on the back of history too, very clever of this man lol well done sir lol
Comment14	Colonialism was wrong.  Like Partition in Ireland.  Britain - and England in particular - have an intrinsic inability to see anything wrong, or take any criticism of their Green &amp; Pleasant Land.
Comment15	The world has a lot to thank the British empire for. Abolishing slavery, countless inventions and of course defeating genuinely tyrannical empires like the Third Reich. It&#39;s easy and lazy to criticise the British. It&#39;s British ideals that allow you the freedom  to do it in the first place.
Comment16	"bbc <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpDVnh_06WI&amp;t=0m12s"">0:12</a> it belongs to this man? is he alive?"
Comment17	What relevance does a white colonizer attacking south east asians mean for a country that is majority ethnically Chinese?
Comment18	The BBC is the mouthpiece of the liberal, metropolitan middle-class, not a reflection of the views of the British people nor anyone with morals
Comment19	OMG Asian women.... oh man I&quot;m moving there :D
Comment20	I like his work . He’s challenging people to think about their cities history . He took the time to research Raffles and challenged the ideology of his name and  the public imagery of this figure . Wether people agree or not it opens a dialogue .
