Comment11	Watch my unlocked mona lisa and many more paintings.  See your future otherwise more people have to suffer.
Comment12	I truly believe that if Trump does get impeached and removed from office, there will be many of his followers shocked.  In my opinion, from almost the very beginning of his presidency, Trump was an egotist who was all about show and getting his pockets lined as quickly as possible and in any way possible!!!  He&#39;s corrupt, self absorbed, a liar and not capable of the truth until it hits him!!!
Comment13	WOW TDS reigns supreme in the comments!
Comment14	CANT BELIEVE HOW CORRUPT YOU ARE BCC ,
Comment15	TRUMP IS AN INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMINAL , AS  THE US  PRESIDENT ,HE  IS IN FAVOR OF ARMING MASSES OF CIVILIANS ,DESPITE WITNESSING PAINFUL TRAGEDIES OF SHOOTING INCIDENTS ALL ACROSS US ,<br />IMPEACH HIM FOR THAT ,NOT FOR MAKING A PHONE CALL TO UKRAINE OR IMPORTING BALOONS FROM RUSSIA ,
Comment16	Impeach Trump now. The world will win when Trump is out of the White House. Lock him up. Greedy arrogant lying plum
Comment17	The never ending impeachments are getting very repetitive and boring .Its worse than the re moaners in the UK who do not accept the 2016 referendum result. So constantly ask for another referendum till they get what they want.
Comment18	Nothing to see here, lads.  Us Yanks are just making a bit of noise before the elections next year. Stay calm and carry on.
Comment19	Trump has been so controversial, for so long, I wish he&#39;d resign.  Then the world can get back to some sense of normalcy.  Congressional Subpoenas should be enforced.
Comment 19.1	Yeah pedos can walk free anybody can cross the border and judge people on skin colour and gender
Comment20	Never going to happen
