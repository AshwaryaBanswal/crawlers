Comment56	What does the Royal Family do for living? Just being the Royal Family or anything else?
Comment 56.1	@M Scott Ok. Thank you very much for your response.
Comment 56.2	They support more than 2,000 charities and attend about 3,000 engagements a year, raising about 2 billion pounds for charity. The Prince of Wales has helped about 5 million young people get a start in life through his personal charity.  They provide employment and their events bring money into the economy.  In addition, the Crown Estate pays ¬£300 million pounds a year to the Treasury, so the taxpayer.  Next question.  By the way, the monarchy is funded by the Sovereign Grant, which comes from the Crown Estate revenue, so it is not taxpayer funded.
Comment 56.3	Tax payers
Comment57	Brexit will mark the end of British empire.
Comment 57.1	@Hesham Mashhour no we can manage thank you
Comment 57.2	@Hesham Mashhour are you related to Trump?
Comment 57.3	mel grant I mean you Britons are so incompetent you can‚Äôt even rule yourselves, let someone else do the job
Comment 57.4	I think the power of the Queen is greatly understated at the request of the House of Windsor. I think the royal family has always ruled the UK in secret, and Europe.
Comment 57.5	"@Hesham Mashhour <a href=""http://no.it/"">no.it</a> would have been the end of Britain if we had stayed.we would just be a member state of the Eu and be ruled by Brussels"

Comment 61.1	Bernie Basset stop acting smart stupid streetshitter fuck that‚Äôs not what I meant stop waffling and anyway the kohinoor was given to us by Indians themselves
Comment 61.2	@Unknown2234 Unknown Indians in India make up an 8th of the global population alone. Most of the world definitely isn&#39;t a white English person bowing down to an unelected, redundant, expensive relic of a bygone era covered in stolen jewellery.

Comment 66.1	Kind of hard to be illiterate and type words at the same time. BTW, we&#39;re all well fed and educated now so you can save the royalty BS for Hollywood and glass slippers.
Comment 66.2	Why should I respect your queen? I am from india, I do have respect for your prime minister. But a queen in 2019 with this much pomp is waste
Comment 66.3	@Scott Elliott hahahaha I&#39;m asian but I still have respect for our majesty the queen.
Comment67	Good for her the baby eater.
Comment68	Return our looted Kohinoor diamondüëø
Comment 68.1	For heaven&#39;s sake, stop whining about the past.  Concentrate on things like why corrupt Indian politicians steal western aid money from the people of India, or why the Indian government is spending hundreds of millions on a space rocket when people are struggling.
Comment 68.2	We&#39;ll give you a glass replica. üíé

Comment77	Due to wrong FAITH, Destructive level of human&#39;s emotions, actions/deeds will destroy human&#39;s world. Let&#39;s try to prove, how ? Everything/happenings in our surroundings affects our body through our various body parts, basically our eyes to create EMOTIONS inside our body. EMOTIONS create our demands through our desires. This is the basic functioning principle of our body. ISLAM teaches us balancing (safety level within maximum and minimum) and the devil (IBLEES SAITAN/one eyed DAZZAL/greedy jin and human those missions are only to success in this world, they never believe the life after DEATH) trying continuously to make our EMOTION imbalanced. Our intentions must be based on our HEREAFTER/AKHIRA/DEATH first. Then we can be happy in this world also (Inshallah). The devil basically using all types of social platform/media to imbalance our EMOTIONS through artificial intelligence(AI) technology now.
