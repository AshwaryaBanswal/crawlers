Comment1	What&#39;s next ,traffic report?
Comment2	Yo Dutch... It&#39;s them Illinois taxes :-) them storms don&#39;t want no part of it. Everything stays away from Illinois
Comment3	Has there been an earthquake forecast since this weather update?
Comment4	Coopertropics have you heard about a methane gas leaks around the plant? Dahboo just do a video on this. This could be the cause of all of the apartment/ buildings/ stores blowing up !? Just my thoughts!
Comment5	HAARP!  They can&#39;t hide something in plane sight - unless people are not EDUCATED or smart enough to SEE IT!!!  PEOPLE!  please, PLEASE educate yourselves about HAARP - what it is, how it works, who is using it.  The information is out there!
Comment6	It probably just &quot;missed&quot; some thing or some place it was supposed to &quot;hit!&quot;, the first go around
Comment7	Watch see storm going where she‚Äôs repairing herself
Comment8	Hi
Comment9	Mr Mbb333 shows a film from woman in Ca. showing ‚Äúredshift‚Äù sky at same time as your storm changed directions! Seems indicative that something DID occur at that moment?!
Comment10	Weather manipulations, <br />I don&#39;t know why this surprises me, they manipulate all else
Comment11	Thank you Copper.
Comment12	WTF?
Comment13	I‚Äôm 1 hr SW of Chicago. Definitely something weird going on last night
Comment14	unsubscribed, AGAIN! since yesterday.  You MUST armour up Dutch! No doubt you&#39;re targeted. Many thanks for your reports of our truth. And for you evil trolls....You&#39;ll get yours in the end. Is it worth it??? I think NOT.

Comment16	Glad it‚Äôs missing u! üôè
Comment17	Kittys talking to u Dutch! ü§ó
Comment18	Meew meuw. Iloveemtoo!
Comment19	Wow the cabbage patch of satelite pulses seems convincing bc there&#39;s even more energy in play that influences the storm\energy frequencies\electricity + static\the power grid + various EMF&#39;s.....wind, temp., temp. variance, precip., atmospheric pressure, acidity lol<br /><br />i hope this stuff is legit!?   <br /><br />That&#39;s like a bunch of energy just kinda exacerbating all willy nilly and stuff into the storm system?!    0_o
Comment20	Came thru Des Moines twice today. 1.6 inches of rain.
