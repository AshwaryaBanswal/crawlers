Comment7	This is terrible reporting
Comment8	The use of frequencies to inflict manufactured artificial schizophrenia is a human rights crime.The television industry will never brain wash a Republican who wants to see a end to the monarchy,will never change his views.The BBC took with a evil family by illegal access to a British man and have taken his human rights to a wife and children.<br />It&#39;s not a joke ever so face court with your victim.
Comment9	This is where the BBC is at, they are putting Emanuel Macron on a pedestal and shitting on Boris. I can&#39;t imagine how brainwashed and deluded you have to be to actually swallow this crap.<br /><br /><br />Brexit can&#39;t come sooner.
Comment10	Brexit means Brexit , means itself that means nothing <br />No better prospect wi th or without EU for the UK
Comment11	YooKai is back into turmoiiiiil
Comment12	Corbyn could not fix his glasses before the interview? Looks a bit twisted there
Comment13	Nice bit of racism there.
Comment14	EU will never agree to anything because they don&#39;t want England to leave. They fear will grow back into the great empire we once were before the first and second world wars. They don&#39;t want Britannia. They forget we bought the iron industrial to the world and yet treat our country as the doormat of the Europe. They won&#39;t agree to anything unless it benefits them and not us, and they got some of the MPs wrap around their little finger making it harder to leave and come down to a deal.
Comment15	WE WON&#39;T GET BREXIT.<br />The actors we have as poLIEticians are just messing around, wasting time, waiting for some big event to happen so they can cancel it.<br />I feel a war coming very soon, which will be the perfect excuse to shelve the BREXIT idea, because we all have to &#39;stick together in these difficult times&#39;.

Comment26	Looks like we are heading for a No Deal Brexit.... Good. :)
Comment27	This is what happens when you occupy a part of a foreign country!
Comment28	How about FUCK OFF AGREEMENT!!
Comment29	I am so tired to that endless and ridicule Brexit farce and the UK¬¥s national, historical, cultural¬†and political¬†identity crisis around it. The British Empire collapsed soon after the from the UK¬¥s point of view many ways Pyrrhic WWII &quot;victory&quot;, which the Soviet Union and the USA won. In 1989 Germany even won¬†in long term the WWII in Europe when the Iron Curtain and the¬†Berlin Wall collapsed and Germany re-united.¬†Today Germany is¬†increasingly politically, economically and industrially¬†the leading¬†superpower in the¬†&quot;Fourth Reich&quot; EU, which is lika a Phoenix from the ashes of the WWII reborn Holy Roman Empire. Historically then the UK fought the WWI and the WWII in Europe practically because nothing, only because bully¬†nationalistic pride and the UK¬¥s historical outdated Balance of Power-policy that worked centuries well, but¬†turned really disastrous when the 20th century began in Europe that ruined and collapsed the British Empire and the UK position in Europe. Now the¬†many ways confused Britons can¬¥t decide do they want to be officially¬†a Western Province of the Fourth Reich EU or not in future and¬†a part of them fear that though the UK¬†tries to leave the Reich the Reich will never leave the UK in Europe. Anyway God save the Queen and¬†Her¬†Majesty¬¥s Government and Prime Minister and¬†greetings from Northern Europe, from partly arctic &quot;Fourth Reich&quot; EU Province Finland.
Comment30	No brexit is worth having. Hard brexit is dumb, and soft brexit is worse than staying in the EU.
Comment31	he dosent understand england he said ,thats because we dont follow them wagging our tails
Comment32	Johnson is useless &amp; a trump clone
Comment 32.1	Worthless comment.
Comment33	Don&#39;t rush.. Its only been 3 years.
Comment34	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H8M2QPt-Kc&amp;t=0m53s"">0:53</a> this WHAT say? lol"
Comment35	Get rid of the DUP!! Get them out now they are trouble out out out go  feck off to England or just get lost! Holding up everything!!
Comment36	Almost everyone is talking about the border between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland. What about the border between Gibraltar and Spain? Gibraltar is also going to leave European Union, together with the United Kingdom...
Comment 36.1	I believe Gibraltar already has a hard border,with security checks and passport control, similar to entering the mainland UK  from Europe.
Comment37	Pisa üí©
Comment38	UK don&#39;t want one
Comment39	Breaking News :- Daily Star to be investigated over front page lies on Tommy Robinson
Comment40	Have anyone seen the upstair  shaking  legs&#39;
Comment41	With the BBC SELLING US OUT TO EU. WHO NEEDS ENEMIES WHEN THERES PLENTY OF TRAITORS .<br />NO MORE TV LICENCE FEE.FOR YOU BUNCH OF TOSSERS
Comment42	If you think the crazy loons of the DUP are going to agree to anything ever you are having a laugh.
Comment43	Fake reasons for brexit: democracy, immigrants, saving millions we send to the EU every week<br />Real reasons for brexit: EU¬¥s legislation on money laundry, tax evasion, users data privacy...<br />I pity the stupid poor right that believes in their &quot;leaders&quot;...
Comment44	Maybe make Northern Ireland it&#39;s own autonomous region.
Comment45	I have a small business in Northern Ireland which like hundreds of others depends on a first class next day delivery of parts from England.  I order today and can have those parts fitted tomorrow.   The EU demands will put me and lots of other small companies out of business due to their internal border demands.   Any internal customs in side the UK will slow delivery of needed parts to several days maybe even weeks.  Then those using Royal Mail will be hit harder as Royal mail charge ¬£8 to collect ¬£2 or ¬£3 on behalf of the inland rev Ie customs.   This plan no balls Boris is willing to agree to will see many jobs lost here in Northern Ireland and in England.  It dosnt even adress the border problem the EU talk about as a company can import from England to Northern Ireland claim it is not for the EU and claim a rebate then sell those goods out to shops etc who sell to any one coming in through the doors  no passports needed.    Those goods can then cross the EU border to the Republic of Ireland.. <br />  Then what about the ordinary Northern Ireland  online shoppers that buy millions a month  from the rest of the UK Boris has no plans to give them rebates and intends to make them pay high EU tariffs and Vat. Meaning the people of Northern Ireland can not benefit from the lower prices out side the EU.
Comment46	The time and the money got spent is incredible. It‚Äôs a complete choke.....
Comment47	Uk playing the blaming game :)))
Comment48	Why doesnt the EU do what it demands of the UK. It can put Ireland in a special zone, in and out of the EU. Put a border up between the EU and Ireland with special status. <br />That&#39;s even better that the current proposal because Ireland keeps its integrity and isn&#39;t split<br />Oh I get it, the EU won&#39;t do that. Why should it expect any country to do the same? <br />Tell them to foxtrott oscar
Comment 48.1	Typo.<br /><br /><br />Why should we in the UK pay because Ireland isn&#39;t allowed by the EU to adhere to the GFA?
Comment 48.2	@Lauren Hedman Why should we in the EU pay because Ireland isn&#39;t allowed by the EU to adhere to the GFA?
Comment 48.3	Why should we in Ireland pay for a decision made in Britain by British people? Why should we have to do anything to make this better for ye? Ye voted to leave. So leave.
Comment49	Time for sinn fein to take their seats now, the boris wont need the DUP anyway
Comment 49.1	@Nickle yeah fair point
Comment 49.2	Swear that oath, loyalty to the UK and not Ireland, and the queen
Comment50	Jean-Claude Juncker says &quot;Everyone understands English nobody understands England&quot;.  I understand Juncker in that he pretends not to understand the UK&#39;s referendum results and needs.  A good example of the bureaucrat who values his bureaucracy ahead of serving the people.
Comment51	It has been THREE YEARS! So why the last minute panic? They are like school children doing their homework on the bus on a Monday morning!
Comment 51.1	@General Ripper Spot on!
Comment 51.2	Too true!
Comment 51.3	Because at the end of the day, they all return to their multimillion pound apartments in Chelsea.
Comment52	&quot;Cant be certain about the outcome&quot; - Of course not. Three years of dicking about will obviously lead to uncertainty. Nobody knows much about the deal because the Dog ate it.
Comment53	No one wants a deal!
Comment54	Why didn&#39;t they start getting a deal back in 2016 after the EU referendum, instead of waiting for the last minute?
Comment 54.1	Theresa May started negotiating a deal after article 50 was implemented in 2017. Its just the hardliners in the Tory party didn‚Äôt like that deal.
Comment 54.2	MrDhartz <br /><br />They love the lime-light,and to show their power,so they can use their news channels to brainwash you into submission,without you even realising it.<br />Wake up and smell the coffee
Comment55	Ain&#39;t Ever Gonna Happen. Not Now and Ever. The Falsehood of Brexit is Now The Fall Of Britain.<br />Who Would&#39;ve though. <br />Oh Well. Hard Times.
Comment56	Schr√∂dinger&#39;s Brexit
Comment57	No deal
Comment58	WARNING!! USUAL ANTI BREXIT PROPAGANDA FROM THE BBC!
Comment59	Haha good job.....Brexit or Bust.
Comment60	NI votes to stay in EU but England takes them out  (while NI remains part of customs territory for border purposes) cutting them off with a border in the Irish sea.....Seems unfair but perhaps workable.
Comment61	What a bulls up from the start and most of us said it would be. No matter what happens.
Comment 61.1	Yep and these (according to remoaners) are 650 of the most intelligent people in the country!
Comment62	Can&#39;t you stop lying? It is not a deal, it is leaving agreement. Deal has to be made after you leave. Why can&#39;t you get it, BBC propaganda?
Comment63	Corbyn is irrelevant; McDonell is the one running things now, and he is not &quot;asking&quot; the party to oppose a deal, he is &quot;telling&quot; them. However, given that the LibDems new position is No Brexit, and that there are still Tory rebels holding their seats in the House (for the time being, as the next General Election will see an end to them), then there is still a possibility of a &quot;No Deal&quot; Brexit. That would be my preference as it would mean that once free from Brussels control, we would be in a strong negotiating position for trade deals with EU member states, not least the leading one, Germany, which needs to see its exports to the UK continuing.
Comment64	I think they have brought out a container with a series of long and short straws in it so that they can clutch at them
Comment65	What in the world are the EU and the British fighting over? These partners really didn‚Äôt have much of a partnership. <br />I thought the US was lame but maybe I didn‚Äôt do a very comparative <br />study. <br />Corbin is a complete .....<br /><br />Peace
Comment66	Corbyn in the chemist picking up his incontinence pants.
Comment67	Fuck the english. Say goodbye, you will not be missed
Comment68	slap some brex tape on it.  bam!
Comment69	There is availability of spaces in my institution, first come first served basis.
Comment70	Who would have guessed that 200 years later Britain would impose Napoleon&#39;s Continental System on themselves haha.
Comment 70.1	Big Tex; The old historical the UK¬¥s outdated &quot;balance of power&quot;- policy (partly using the same foreign policy tactics and principles¬†as the ancient historical Roman Empire during its expansion)¬†in Europe still worked against Napoleon and later during the 19th century¬†against the Russian Empire too¬†like it had worked centuries against¬†the Spanish Empire, the Kingdom of France and the French Empire and even against the Holy Roman Empire and the¬†Habsburg Dynasty commonly for¬†centuries. The UK¬¥s old and outdated¬†&quot;balance of power&quot; -policy never worked against united Germany and the German Empire since 1871 and it turned from the UK¬¥s point of view very disastrous when the 20th century began in Europe, because¬†the rising German Empire¬†was practically alone stronger than especially the land army¬†military weak British Empire, the French Empire and the Russian Empire together and only massive scale US military help during the WWI and later during the WWII saved the commonly military weak UK though Germany never wanted to occupy the UK, not during the WWI and not during the WWII. Imperial Germany had¬†achieved during the WWI¬†a¬†massive scale victory against the Russian Empire, which turned to revolution and anarchy after a massive scale military revolt in St Petersburg and Germany wanted only peace with France and the British Empire, which were¬†massive scale supported by the USA and the US Army.¬†Later during the WWII Adolf Hitler actually wanted desperately permanent peace to Europe and to found some kind of his style EU under¬†political leadership of the NSDAP Germany and permanent working peace¬†with the UK and¬†mostly the old Imperial Germany¬¥s borders back in Continental¬†Europe¬†and perhaps too the Imperial Germany¬¥s before the WWI colonies¬†back. During the WWI even the Imperial Germany Navy was practically¬†as strong as the Royal Navy though it had over careful tactic and¬†less war ships because the German war ships were commonly better and more secure¬†than the British Royal Navy¬†war ships, which many times exploded and sank¬†disastrous way during naval¬†battles killing a lot of the Royal Navy¬†crew members. German U-boats were then superior during the WWI.¬†Modern &quot;Fourth Reich&quot; EU is practically¬†like Phoenix from the ashes of the WWII¬†reborn Holy Roman Empire, which was the historical¬†&quot;First Reich&quot; in Europe, which did last about 1000 year since the beginning of the Medieval Era to the Napoleon¬¥s Wars. Nationalism then began commonly to¬†rise all around¬†in Europe, especially in Germany and Italy,¬†because Napoleon and the French military expansion, that failed because the victorious Imperial Russian army, which finally occupied Paris and Napoleon¬¥s France surrendered, that was historically the end of the French Army¬†military success in the world. The French Army¬¥s¬†new¬†military tradition was¬†and still today is¬†to surrender whenever it is possible, just like the Italian Army, lol.¬†By the way the governing¬†capitol city of the¬†Habsburg Emperor Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire¬†was Brussels just like the modern Fourth Reich¬†EU¬¥s governing¬†capitol city. Charles V¬†was too the King of the¬†during his era¬†fast rising¬†Spanish Empire and he ruled the first global¬†European empire ever where the Sun never set.
Comment71	The ONLY Brexit worth having is where we dont kowtow to the EU and divide up our Great Britain!
Comment 71.1	Funny how you think the &quot;kowtowing&quot;, as you call it, will stop after you&#39;ve ejected yourselves from the largest trade bloc in the world right on your doorstep.
Comment 71.2	1 of the countries of ‚Äòour‚Äô Great Britain (Scotland) and N Ireland voted to remain
Comment 71.3	I&#39;m sure that any deal they make will meet your exacting requirements...
Comment 71.4	Nurdhurrrr nationalism
Comment 71.5	Well said Paul exactly my sentiments.
Comment72	EU Visa runs out Schengan Area (signed in the middle of a river?)...? not a problem jump into a non Schengan area... UK or Republic of Ireland<br />..Republic need to send the underwriters in,staying out of Schengan to facilitate Common Travel Area,, but getting Schengan immigration status .is: preventing &quot; Sanctuary City Eire&quot;<br />..thanks
Comment73	People should watch more things that they forbid us to watch in order to understand our current state of captivity. Watch: &quot;Europa The Last Battle&quot; at archive-dot-org. Entire doc banned on YT. Victors write the history
Comment74	A deal means no Brexit - what else?
Comment 74.1	Not necessarily <br />Wait and see ...
Comment75	&quot;Leave then negotiate &quot;man..LOL...
Comment 75.1	Yes leave and then negotiate, some deals have taken decades. Imagine then having to renegotiate over 60 more
Comment76	The deal will be only valid when the parliament agreed. How can a minority government win the vote? Wasted time because there was already a deal before and it was 3 times rejected. Looking forward what happens.
Comment77	They better make this happen, because if they don&#39;t? The next general election for so many politicians will be their last!! <br /><br />Aready have the Popcorn...
Comment 77.1	@Philshki82 yeah that is sadly the truth. Scary thought.
Comment 77.2	Chris Wild <br /><br />The EU will be running your country,because you give up your sovereignty,you are lost to them forever,prepare to lose everything.<br />PS They won&#39;t need most of the politicians anyway,you will be ruled from the central hub Brussels.<br />You are screaming for your own demise,wake up and get out,you will prosper.
Comment 77.3	Yes. The Portillo cases will be legion
Comment78	If the EU like it it means we have been stiffed by yet more consessions<br />Traiterous scum in parliament
Comment79	I say while you&#39;re at it this &quot;Bexit&quot; logic for leaving the EU should do the same for the UN and NATO.
Comment 79.1	Once the EU has its army,navy and airforce I foresee them telling the US and us where to go with NATO....
Comment80	All you brexiteers, you are playing right into Putin&#39;s hands!  Nice job!
Comment81	Have they tried looking down the back of the sofa?
Comment82	The UK have played a blinder. Fooled everyone. lol  Bye, bye EU.
Comment83	Check between the sofa cushions
Comment84	Tell the EU to get stuffed ..we are England , we beat the Reich and we can sure as hell beat a bunch of self serving Belgian nonces.. fuck the EU..
Comment85	Deliver Democracy. Leave the EC, trade on World Trade Terms just like the rest of the world. Meanwhile, these incompetent UK &amp; EU political millionaires can argue and haggle over the next trade deal to line their own pockets. The real winners here are the greasy politicians on both sides.
Comment 85.1	The rest of the world doesn&#39;t trade of world trade terms
Comment86	Europe wanted to stand a conclusion but the only thing is we can only hope for a better future by tomorrow or Friday and then we get the results the EU has got to summit it yet. Because where I from I got Gypsies around at the park setting off fireworks at 10:01pm and got like Immigrant selling drugs inside the park in state as well.<br />It needs to stop.<br />But some of you don&#39;t care for that so why do I even bother telling you lot you the pricks that wanted to fellow Jeremy Corbyn anyways.
Comment87	Free UK FREE HK!
Comment88	But we REALLY want to have our cake and we REALLY want to eat it, too. -Brexiteers
Comment 88.1	Amin Abadmood You know its not only brussel people we are people from many countries like yours? We have have feelings about good and bad with EU. In Sweden first very sceptic no we are all in its the new reality? Like the rules of market? But many people everywhere have goals, and if you get more its like opening the door to endless renegotiations like you are having
Comment 88.2	Better us have it than Brussels.
Comment89	I see Northern Ireland as a <i>customs tax heaven</i><br />Goods from China pouring into the EU without paying any taxes.
Comment 89.1	I&#39;m surprised your racist ass didn&#39;t throw in Russia for good measure. Let&#39;s face it it&#39;s white Brits who will try it on.....your past record agrees with my assessment.
Comment90	Arlene Foster is a WWE male wrestler in disguise
Comment 90.1	Brendan Coughlan lol üòÇ
Comment 90.2	What&#39;s the disguise?
Comment 90.3	@Robert Barr And when the UDF were murdering Catholics in Ulster she was laughing her ass off, right!
Comment 90.4	When the ira where blowing you guys up in London she was facing them as a true warrior in northern Ireland...
Comment 90.5	Crap disguise.
Comment91	If Brussels are happy with the deal then its happening as they will just tell treasonous remoaners that if they do not vote it through they will not offer an extension. So it will be either this deal or no deal.
Comment 91.1	Hahahaha &#39;treasonous remoaners&#39; you got the whole script by heart Dumbo!
Comment 91.2	Either way would be OK.  Britain does not need them.
Comment 91.3	UK PATRIOT Nobody would be called UK patriot in caps unless a troll.. Surely? You even dropped treason and Remoaner in there!
Comment92	"Oh My God!!!! Pls Pls Watch This! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeI7khz6TKE&amp;t=4s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeI7khz6TKE&amp;t=4s</a>"
Comment93	"The EU really know how to negotiate, we need practice, my guess is that they won&#39;t give more than an inch just like last time.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BrexitMeansExit"">#BrexitMeansExit</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wtoletsgo"">#wtoletsgo</a>"
Comment94	Grieve, Lammy and the other MPs that went to Brussels yesterday for talks should be stripped of their privileges and investigated. If this was a war they would be held for treason.<br />They are a disgrace to the country.
Comment 94.1	But it&#39;s not a war, and they can talk to who the fuck they want.
Comment95	Two things are absolutely sure re BJ&#39;s actions in the next few days: 1) BLAME the EU if no deal comes out of the negotiations; and 2) BLAME parliament if a deal is reached and MPs reject it.
Comment 95.1	@Joe Bloggs. or do you mean the Conservatives who think they speak for Scotland who voted to remain in the EU???  don&#39;t pull that card.  it&#39;s shitty.
Comment 95.2	@Joe Bloggs. oh, you mean like the DUP brex-shit-eers who pretend to speak for the whole of Northern Ireland which voted to remain???
Comment 95.3	@Tony de Castro like all the remain mps who stood on manifestos to get elected then betrayed their electorate?
Comment 95.4	@Joe Bloggs. Boris is a congenital LIAR...
Comment 95.5	Yes, Boris tells the truth. Glad you agree.
Comment96	Aaaaaacttttcchhhoooooo....<br /><br />Sry.. im alergic to bullshit....
Comment97	Question for British: just curious can BJ request a really short extension like a day(or a minute) and exit on technicality
Comment 97.1	No nozim he has to ask for a 3 month extension minimum. But if the EU want a longer extension he has to accept, hence why it&#39;s called the treasonous surrender bill. There is a way out of it and Boris is playing the remoaners fantastically.
Comment98	We voted to Leave!   Over 17 million people Why are our MPs so  damn cowardly? All they do is appease EU  very and over again
Comment 98.1	@michaelthedriver Yeah whatever!!
Comment 98.2	@Johnny Rad Yes! I bet your one of these weak people that would rather fly the flag of the EU than that of your own nation, for you too are a coward that has no faith in our nation! Go fuck yourself!
Comment 98.3	Do any of the 17 million care about any of the 16 million remainers cuz if u don&#39;t then ur selfish cuz all u care about is yourselves
Comment 98.4	17 million out of 65 million people, is not an overwhelming majority
Comment99	Brexit supporters are snowflakes and should be ignored.
Comment 99.1	@michaelthedriver keep dreaming
Comment 99.2	@Nik Naim Norisham it&#39;s not a majority. Of the 33 million who voted yes but not out of the whole 66 million because after 2016 another 2 million voters were then eligible to vote and most of them said they woulve voted Remain so it would&#39;ve been more like 18 million Remain, 17 leave but those 2 million innocent people never got the chance to have their say as well as the 5 million leavers who signed a partition to vote again
Comment 99.3	Still have a majority than your Remoaners. Come on, brexit means brexit
Comment100	Hugh Edwards  -  &quot;A border between Northern Ireland and the U.K.&quot;  Constitutionally impossible Hugh.  There is no U.K. without Northern Ireland.  There&#39;s just Gt. Britain.  Like so many others Edwards equates &#39;U.K.&#39; with Gt. Britain.  Really surprising and disappointing from such a prominent commentator on BBC.  Ironically Edward&#39;s slip - up reflects the long held position of Sinn Fein and the Republican movement who NEVER use the term &#39;United Kingdom&#39; as they also never say  &#39;Northern Ireland&#39;  when referring to the six counties concerned.  They invariably use the term &#39;The north of Ireland&#39; to avoid legitimising British rule in any part of Ireland as they see it.
Comment 100.1	Or maybe not old enough to remember what it was like!
Comment 100.2	jsbart96 you are clearly not Irish!
Comment 100.3	Stephen Devlin not with the DUP it would never happen, we can barely afford the people that are here!
Comment 100.4	Sarah Pitchford not sure if any of those claims are backed up by reality or evidence üòÇ
Comment 100.5	@Sarah Pitchford plenty of studies to show Ireland would actually thrive as one nation
Comment101	What&#39;s the difference between BBC News and CNN? Nothing fake news! My British brothers and sisters hold it together! Where we go one we go all<br />üá¨üáß + üá∫üá∏ together We support    &quot;F R E E D O M&quot;
Comment 101.1	Fuck off U.S!
Comment102	I&#39;ve got a solution for the Irish situation - the British invaders get hell out!!
Comment 102.1	@SEAN INGRAM I didn&#39;t want to perpetuate yet another fake myth about the Irish  - yet reading back your comment about medication was fair, though inaccurate.   <br /><br />Honestly  - this topic upsets me, a lot, people have fought and died for this even before the famine  - <br /><br />people I know and love  - and those I never had the opportunity to meet (shot outside a church on a wedding day - this  - this - THIS - is what the British did to my family  - THIS is why we finally left our homeland  - *THIS*) <br /><br /><br />You married Sean?

Alien invasion??? Go to the media???? WHO controls the media???)<br /><br />eading was a wee bit drunk (upset, outraged) the other day. Let me clarify some things. <br /><br />You dont know me or my family. I am 100% Irish on my da&#39;s side - that&#39;s where my irish citizenship is from. <br /><br />As I said before, my mother&#39;s heritage is irish catholic females marrying english protestant men.<br /><br /> I&#39;m not english - though some of my ancestors were  - the ones that left.<br /><br />I am Irish - I&#39;m one of the dispossessed  - a descendant of those that fled  elsewhere. <br /><br />Still an irish citizen  - still have a vote, a voice, a say<br /><br />As I said, you dont know me, you dont know my family. <br /><br />Yes technically I still own some land in Ireland- this has come to me through my father&#39;s <b>maternal</b> line (and through her, directly related to the Kennedys  - simply intelligent, affluent, educated irish catholic are always are threat..)<br /><br />To this day distant family still live on and profit from this land - they dont pay rent, and regardless of what I said we would never actually &quot;reclaim&quot; their home omg the very thought is sickening - what was it you were saying - breaking the back? You dont know me or my family - <br /><br />one of my uncles visited them about 20 years ago ( no, more, my da passed 20 years ago  - this was well before that) - they thought he was there to reclaim the land  - he just wanted to see what his parents had spoken about with such love. <br /><br />Again, you dont know me, my da, his family. My da was asked time and time and time again to serve people, to serve his community, to act as a leader  - he did so (voluntarily, in his spare time) because this was who he was as a person  as a human being<br /> <br />From both family stories from my aunt&#39;s and uncles of their father (my da was one of the youngest, was a teen when their da died) this was partly because of who his father was  - and partly because of who he was, my father, as a man, as a person, as a human being.<br /><br />I know not only from family stories, but from the historical record (which is irrefutable) that my grandfather, his da, was the same way. A leader who gave to his people, his community. <br /><br />I know from the stories my uncles told me of the generations before that this is who we are as a people - the Connells and the other proud Irish families that make up the rest of my ancestry<br /><br />I know that unlike most other cultures to be a leader you were not simply born into the role, you were not <b>automatically</b> a leader because your father happenedto be a leader - as such you might have had advantages - but to actually lead - you had to EARN your place - you had to be chosen to lead, <b>chosen by the people</b> <br /><br />(And not just men  - Celtic women had privileges and DUTIES as leaders too)<br /><br />I can not speak for all my ancestors, I can not say they were without blame or fault. I can only speak to their hearts, mind and spirit as been passed down to me through the stories of my da, my siblings, their parents and the generations before them including the songs my da sang to me and my older siblings,  the songs his grandmother sang to him as a child.<br /><br />You may tell your lies english. <br /><br />The four green fields will be whole one day
Comment 102.2	Julia Connell so as I said previously your family has, for generations by your accounts, persecuted the Irish workers. As you are obviously bouncing around on your medication I will leave you to ponder what generations of your own family did to the Irish workers. Rethink your history and stop blaming the British for the skullduggery your family paid a large part in.
Comment 102.3	Julia Connell lordy your hard work. Firstly, I at no point called anybody stupid, albeit that the Irish can claim injustice and whinge incessantly, around 800 years to be precise. My point on poverty was that both Catholics and protestants suffered equally, as did those on the mainland. You seem to have avoided my observation that Ireland was, and continues to be, a free loading nation. Mostly from the British who they detest so much. As formland requisition, how far are you going back? Because if your going back to the 13 kings then your deluded. What you are now saying is your family was a large part of the problem and not thensolution
Comment 102.4	@SEAN INGRAM oh and catholic &quot;poverty&quot; - you wish!<br /> They had their land (confiscated), some (most?  A fraction? No idea)  clever enough to still own it and pass it onto me and my family - they (the dis possessed) bought businesses in CASH - I have the legal authority  to re-claim.this land any time I chose ( my da  - a lawyer  - and my 2 of my siblings (also lawyers) chose not to. You WANT to think of us as poor and stupid  we are  NOT
Comment 102.5	Julia Connell so your actually saying your not Irish your English?
Comment103	What a load of sham-bollocks!
Comment104	I just dont understand why it&#39;s so complicated...
Comment 104.1	Paperclip <br /><br />The USA has agreed speedily as possible deal.<br />We will prosper and the EU will be a failed bad memory,
Comment 104.2	Andy Johnson  I completely agree. The reason for all this ‚Äúdeal‚Äù nonsense is the way the EU chose to implement one sentence in Article 50: ‚ÄúIn the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union.‚Äù May should have put divorce/leaving and future/trade together into one new treaty; the so-called ‚Äúsuper Canada‚Äù trade deal muted by Tusk in 2018 as a model for the UK. Imagine you said to your future wife; first we have to negotiate a divorce settlement, in exact detail, anticipating the marriage doesn‚Äôt succeed, lets spend two years doing that. Only once that is signed will I actually propose, and then we can focus on getting married. Not sure too many marriages would take place. Hollande called Brexit ‚Äúan existential threat to the EU‚Äù, their strategy was to ensure it was painful, slow, and UK remained as hampered as possible afterwards: for the UK to flourish would be to light the blue touchpaper: Netherlands, Italy, Greece all ready to jump.
Comment 104.3	Maybe if Northern Ireland was never in the UK you would&#39;ve had ur precious Brexit done a year ago
Comment 104.4	@d s 100% well said, and he&#39;s not the only one. üòØ
Comment 104.5	If you don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s so complicated, I wonder what you voted for. If you voted Leave then it&#39;s so clear that you had no idea what was going to happen nor understood what it meant to Leave. So you are just stating your ignorance here, and making clear why the people should NOT have had the choice of voting on such a massive issue.
Comment105	The hard right must not be allowed to get this up without a referendum, which is the first referendum on the real Brexit deal.

Comment113	The eu don&#39;t deserve a deal after how we have been treated for 31/2years no deal out
Comment 113.1	@Denis Muthuon so Denis the answer was no then they don&#39;t all pay the same then.
Comment 113.2	@Michael Gardner don&#39;t quite understand your comment, but let me assume you mean UK is the one of the biggest contributor in the EU funding. To be clear about it, Each country pays the same proportion of its national income to the EU budget, so richer countries pay more and poorer ones less. Some countries, such as the UK, pay less because they receive a rebate (the equivalent of UK income tax alowance, due to the fact UK is not fully in the EU scheme) .<br />So you mean that poorer brits (a majority of leavers by the way) as they pay less income revenue to the UK should have a diminished voice compared to the richer (majority of remainers) ?
Comment 113.3	@Denis Muthuon are these the ones that don&#39;t pay anything in lol
Comment 113.4	@Stevo C It&#39;s a trading bloc, and it&#39;s also a political union. There is a long history in the UK of wanting to leave the EU, even the labour leader Corbyn advocated leaving for decades. The idea that the only reason the UK is leaving is because of the leave campaign&#39;s promises is kind of absurd. I say let them leave and if it turns out bad they can move to rejoin.
Comment 113.5	@20,000 Subscribers Without Any Subscribers Well it is a trading bloc, some of the member states would like closer integration beyond just a trading bloc  but most don&#39;t from what i understand. The UK are leaving because sections of the British media and politicians spun a load of lies in the lead up to the 2016 referendum which lead to a close leave vote being the result.
Comment114	Coming up with a draft treaty hours before a summit. Sure guarantee of quality.
Comment 114.1	@The Other indeed.
Comment 114.2	@Rich Mondo <br />I disagree; Brexit has always been about the toffs screwing the plebs.

Comment 114.4	Joke really, DUP to rejected and back to square one
Comment 114.5	Yeah, totally agree.
Comment115	At the very least there should be a referendum on this deal. After all, the people will now actually know what they are voting for or against for the first time in the whole fiasco.

Comment129	The Remainers are so angry that he&#39;s about to get a deal, you can see it in thier faces xD. <br /><br />Their whole facade of saving the UK from the &quot;No Deal apocalypse&quot; hinged on Boris not getting a deal either.
Comment 129.1	Those who favour the EU have never had any objective other than stopping brexit.
Comment130	I thought the Referendum was &#39;non binding&#39;? Three years of focusing on nothing else, Parliament in shambles, and now a &#39;frantic&#39; search on how to drag Britain out of EU, deal or not. Mmm.  I&#39;d hate to see how the Tories would have behaved if the Ref had been Binding! This is political blackmail and total BS. Sure, SOME Brits are OK with a no deal &#39;frantic&#39; exit from the EU - most are not and No One VOTED for it. I&#39;ll bow to the majority, as we all must. We have no idea what the majority is in this matter, it appears that the minority are now forcing this BS on everyone and there&#39;s NOTHING democratic in that. This was a non binding referendum and the manner in which we leave the EU needs to be voted on by the British People. Yes, it&#39;s a F&#39;ing mess. But put that mess where it belongs. At the Feet of the Conservative Govt.They had no plan,they still have no plan, they put out a very simply worded non binding Referendum and have never had any clue what to do with the results. And The entire Nation has danced to this BS Conservative Tune for three years. ENOUGH!!

Comment 130.2	Yeah they own this shit them and their corporate disaster capitalists media. They sowed it and they growed it and they will reap the rewards of a divided and crisis ridden nation.
Comment 130.3	@Rhodry maelwaedd GB IS the laughing stock of the woeld.
Comment 130.4	The Other what have we got to lose by re sitting every election before the vote has been enacted? Other than the fact that nothing would ever be accomplished, we would be the laughing stock of the world, business would definitely slump due to the uncertainty, no one would ever bother voting as it wouldn‚Äôt matter and then parliament would just become an old boys club of the rich, answerable to no one. What have we got to lose? Everything.
Comment 130.5	No one voted for a &quot;No deal&quot; are you having a laugh ? ... maybe one way to find that out would be to ask all the voters who voted to leave what kind of Brexit they voted for. I bet a majority wanted a no deal. And they&#39;d certainly prefer a no deal to a crap deal. But hey maybe that was the agenda all along. At the risk of doning my tin foil hat it wouldn&#39;t suprise me if the Government have been stringing everyone along with this fiasco while secretly wanting us to get poor deal which binds us to the EU indeffinatley.

Johnson and Cons have pushed a NON BINDING vote on Brexit down everyone&#39;s throats for three years. It&#39;s Non Binding, but F&#39;ing Hell - the Cons feed it to us for breakfast, Lunch and dinner every single day! It&#39;s all they talk about. Despite that - they still have NO F&#39;ING CLUE how to do anything! Just talk, and more talk, and rant, and &#39;act angry&#39;. FFS! Enough is Enough. 1)The Ref was NON BINDING 2) No One voted for a No Deal Frantic Exit from the EU.  That&#39;s the answer to three years of pain and disgust. There&#39;s no mandate for any of this Shit from the Cons and never has been.

Comment 146.2	Like the majority of the population.
Comment 146.3	He caused the problem, he gets no thanks for throwing a glass of water on a fire that he started and that has raged out of control for three years. The Ref was NON BINDING yet Tories have treated it like a binding vote from the second they got the results. No one voted for a no deal frantic exit - Tories held a referendum and had no plan how to implement a sensible exit from the EU. NONE. You still praise them? Get Serious FFS.
Comment147	Brexit since June 23 2016
Comment148	Everyone understands English nobody understands England - Jean-Claude Juncker <br /><br />üòÇ
Comment 148.1	@dean 123 <br />Yes, they have some impact on crime figures, but unless you are going for isolationism the cost benefit of prevention is prohibitive.<br />Illegal migrants are concentrated in the cities, safety in crowds. Mostly doing casual work or self employed with a large proportion working in family businesses they are related to.<br />Of course it would be better if legal residents had these jobs, but again the question if cost benefit of enforcement comes into play.<br />As to those work areas where immigrants dominate, they are quite heavily regulated and risky for illegals.<br />As to why native born do not do these jobs; two main reasons: location, the jobs are in areas where there is high native employment and the unemployed are not prepared to relocate; and physicality, the jobs are physically demanding and the native unemployed lack the physical conditioning to take the job on.
Comment 148.2	@The Other would you say they have an impact on crime figures  in the UK and  also if they are working wouldn&#39;t you think it would be better for someone with legal status to be doing the jobs they are doing I also understand a lot of people won&#39;t do these jobs that they do but why do you think that is.
Comment 148.3	@dean 123 <br />They are young, so they work. They pay someone rent, so that gets taxed. Everything they buy that&#39;s vat covered pays tax. If they smoke or drink they pay duty.<br />They make profits for British businesses so corporation tax gets paid on that.<br />They are young, so generally don&#39;t get sick. If they do get sick enough to go to the NHS and are identified they get deported.<br />If they are homeless and hungry, they get treated with the same disdain that our society treats legally resident homeless and hungry.
Comment 148.4	@The Other could you explain how they are positive contributors to the public purse if by nature they avoid contact with the state    and if they avoid the state what happens to these people when they are  ill or homeless or have no food
Comment 148.5	@dean 123 <br />Given that, by their nature, they avoid contact with the state, how do they strain resources?<br />The strains on our society are the result of longevity, not immigration.<br />An aging population of baby boomers tying up the housing market and an ever increasing strain on the NHS and social care provisions are the root of our problems.<br />Even at the top end of estimates, the 850,000 illegal immigrants will be net contributors to the public purse.
