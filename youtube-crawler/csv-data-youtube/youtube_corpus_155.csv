Comment1	Sacoolas is a proper C U Next Time
Comment2	Trump needs to do the right thing and rescind Anne Sacoolas diplomatic immunity now! Justice for Harry Dunn now! I am an American citizen! God bless those who seek and spread the truth!!!
Comment3	"<b>If anyone wants to hear one of the very few sensible statements concerning the &quot;flight&quot; of Anne S., here it is:</b>  <a href=""https://youtu.be/Ssw8SwR8sHE?t=61"">https://youtu.be/Ssw8SwR8sHE?t=61</a> (1.01 - 2.25)"
Comment4	Hey Anne! Karma is a <br />B!tch. And she always returns the favor!  <br />.<br />Anne Sacoolas, the murderer of Harry DUNN,  is a THUG. A cowardly THUG at that!!
Comment5	Tragic.  But I don&#39;t see how putting the lady in jail will bring Harry back to life.
Comment 5.1	It will. Trust me, it will.
Comment6	I wonder  how much of a war chest was allocated to Lisa Dowd to stir up the emotions and pay the expenses of the Dunn family. The Northampton police wished her to stop as she was  causing too much emotional pain and interfering with the investigation.<br />But Sky have become famous for making their own news complete with female shit-stirring agitators.  Brexit, ISIS,  Syria, Trump, Boris, etc etc. Weren&#39;t  NI folk lucky Sky hadn&#39;t learnt how to stir up so much news back in the day, eh?
Comment7	Rabb &amp; Johnson bent over and got anally fisted by Trump........dry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Comment8	So fucked up that the news reporter told us where they‚Äôd be flying from, like ‚Äúgo get them paparazzi, there‚Äôs still time!‚Äù Disgusting
Comment9	If she was that much devastated she would not of flown back to the USA disgraceful
Comment10	Considering the blood thirsty comments on this forum, any sane person wouldn&#39;t want to return to the UK.
Comment 10.1	@Alex May I wonder if she could get a fair trail with the bias UK media. She did get clearance to leave from the UK. CPS will determine if prosecution is indicated. I have had one instance of driving on the wrong myself years ago when I returned to the US. When you make a turn, you can easily come out on the wrong side just by force of habit. I think that there are about four countries who drive on the left side. They should change to the right. Didn&#39;t Sweden switch some years ago. With so much traffic from mainland Europe coming into the UK, more accidents are inevitable. lory crashes are up 67% in the last few years.
Comment 10.2	And these comments are proof that she made the right decision to leave the country. Or does anyone think people would have been satisfied if she had claimed immunity and stayed in the UK.
Comment11	It was a terrible accident, caused by confusion on lane selection. I had issue with driving on the wrong side in the US myself, after driving on the other side in Thailand. The Dunn&#39;s position is all over the place. First they said that they just wanted answers and wanted to meet. That was a lie, when their bluff was called at the WH by President Trump they refused.  They really didn&#39;t want to meet her. They refused to meet with her at the White House. It seems to me that they just want blood! With all of the negative press in the UK, a fair trial wouldn&#39;t be possible.
Comment12	Special relationship my ass. This is the start of the US showing the UK that they are their little lap dog. Diplomats wives can mow down UK kids with immunity - get over it!.
Comment13	Anne Sacoolas needs to meet a magistrate. What was the breath test result?
Comment14	BBC should ask why one rule for this lady and another for Julian Assange
Comment15	What I am still trying to understand is why this wife of a U.S. Diplomat is not being extradited from this country. I think what I&#39;m getting from the Dunn family is it has been so long that everyone is getting very upset at this point. Prayers for peace.
Comment16	The truth was the US diplomats‚Äô wife had an affair with Harry Dunn, then argument occurred between the pair, the wife was furious drove and murdered the Harry...
Comment17	Abuse of diplomatic immunity. Send her back to UK prison. She is at the very least, an embarrassment to the American people. Harry&#39;s parent should also sue her and perhaps her diplomatic husband too. They probably have some serious money too, which is something, at least.<br />If she wanted to drive on the right, she should&#39;ve stayed in the U.S. or asked her husband to get posted on the Continent.
Comment18	What a coincidence! All the 0.001 percent of people who would go back voluntarily and subject themselves to the justice system of a foreign nation seem to be in this comment section!
Comment19	Raab&#39;s statement is ambiguous. Diplomatic immunity applied at the time of the incident. Is that relevant?
Comment20	She wouldn&#39;t even go to prison if she came back in america you would be looking at some fairly serious prison time but not over here
Comment21	Why did she flee?
Comment22	Why do she flee the country if she had Diplomatic Immunity she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to be arrested anyway unless the US ambassador choose to waive the immunity (which is rare) the best the UK government could do is declare her persona non grata in which case she would have to leave the country within a specified time. But they couldn‚Äôt arrest her
Comment23	If Americans could vote on making her go back we would!
Comment24	Why can she not be extradited ? Trump could put her on a plane speaks volumes for trump and her  britain wont push it no balls dont upset the americans
Comment25	She killed someone. In the u.s it&#39;s 25 or death. How about she gets treated like a u.s criminal
Comment26	I‚Äôm sorry, was she drunk? On drugs? Driving negligently? It‚Äôs called an ACCIDENT. These parents are going way too far and taking advantage of the woman working for the US Government and wanting a big payout. There is nothing that they‚Äôre doing that would help with grieving, period. If she was drunk or crazy, yes I can understand them pursuing it like this. If there was some government coverup and the parents were trying to expose it, then yea. But Anna obviously was distraught and wanted to come home to grieve as well. Nothing compared to the parents of course, but again there‚Äôs nothing the parents can get out of this and it‚Äôs no more important than the thousands of accidental vehicular deaths that happen every day, expect for the fact that the driver can be exploited for no good reason. Smh.
Comment27	What Is her Devistation in comparison to a person&#39;s &quot;DEATH&quot; LIFE LOSS. why does she have the Privilege to leave &amp; be protected by the Gov. The Average Citizen would be &quot;HELD ACCOUNTABLE&quot; for a &quot;HIT &amp; RUN&quot; and FORCED to take &quot;RESPONSIBILITY&quot; for what happened on OUR WATCH as a SANE ADULT. And if she&#39;s insane, she still must face the MUSIC &amp; TAKE HER MEDICINE üò¨
Comment28	Why are bbc with her on plane ? no good will come from jimmy savile supporters.
Comment29	Ann Sacoolas will always be remembered as the woman who ran away from her duty/responsibility and will be possibly picked on for the rest of her life, not just by this forum but on every Social Media Platform in the world,  is doing this really worth a life time of misery??  Is it not enough to have caused the misery in the first place on a innocent family in the UK.  Ann Sacoolas needs to do the right thing, go back face to music ASAP.
Comment 29.1	@Fonzie LOL, you are making history.. Now get on with it..
Comment 29.2	She will be remembered as a foreigner driving on wrong side of road like many of us have done but just been lucky. Nothing but a tragic accident, get over it.
Comment30	She&#39;s a hero in America for fleeing that unjust prosecution over an accident. You limey&#39;s are just trying to railroad her for murder because she&#39;s an American and you&#39;re jealous of all the freedoms we have.
Comment 30.1	Before you lambast me, I&#39;m only joking about the freedom thing.
Comment31	"Update...........Well done Dunns....you didn&#39;t fall for the Trump crap to force you to meet the killer of your son today......but you have been FOOLED into thinking it would be sorted by Trump!<br />HE DOESN&#39;T GIVE A STUFF ABOUT YOU.....IT&#39;S ALL ABOUT HIM!!!!!<br />DON&#39;T YOU GET IT YET......YOU&#39;RE BEING PLAYED!!!!!!!!?????"
Comment32	She wants to express her sympathies and her apologies. She just doesn&#39;t want to face justice.
Comment 32.1	@Bec Evening its morning lol, do I have to apologise for the spelling corrector rofl. Doubt you ever been to the UK but know more than someone been here 60yrs rofl
Comment 32.2	@Fonzie Look I&#39;m not going to bother with you after this...In Britain the act of dangerous driving is a statutory offence - in particular the act of causing death by dangerous driving. She was on the wrong side of the road, so she will be viewed as culpable. Homicide is the term used for murder, not accidental death due to dangerous driving...and I believe the word you are searching for is &#39;irrelevant&#39;, and not &#39;irreverent&#39;. Have a fantastic evening.
Comment 32.3	@Bec Culpable homicide is an american term, irreverent in the UK. Just admit your ignorance and stop playing the fool.
Comment 32.4	@Fonzie Oh I bet you don&#39;t.
Comment 32.5	@Bec We do not use the word culpable, educate yourself.
Comment33	Not devastated enough to stick around and be held responsible for her actions.
Comment 33.1	@Ozymandias Most accidents where deaths occur no one is charged unless some deliberate action is perceived. Accidently driving on the wrong side of the road for a foreigner is hardly malicious.
Comment 33.2	@Fonzie They would likely charge her with some kind of higher tier traffic offence.<br />She was driving on the wrong side of road so there is grounds for causing death by dangerous / reckless driving.<br />Hence consequences in the way of a prison sentence, which would of probably been suspended.<br />But she fled the country like a coward so justice has not been served.
Comment 33.3	She not a murderer, there is no consequence in a tragic accident.
Comment34	Don&#39;t you guys know, some people are above the law.
Comment 34.1	Don`t you know he was speeding ?
Comment35	publish Govt malfeasance = no expense spared witch hunt + indefinite prison while waiting extradition.<br />Manslaughter = cricket sounds.
Comment36	Flee to Russia. They don&#39;t have an extradition treaty with the UK
Comment 36.1	Why she did nothing wrong intentionally, it was just an accident where someone dies like 300 every day in the UK. You want to lock them all up ?
Comment37	Just seen the Dunn&#39;s are getting paid a fortune for there story, and there tips to America are being paid for by the media, Shame on them, selling out there dead kid for money.
Comment 37.1	BBC are on the plane with them, says it all.
Comment38	Has the sex of Harry been checked, as i think this is a lady.
Comment39	Over the past three years this is what we&#39;ve seen from the intelligence community......morally bankrupt...not at all surprised by this behavior
Comment40	I believe that NO country should offer Diplomatic immunity in serious cases like this . ANY wrongful or felony case should NOT be covered by immunity . A parking  ticket ,ok ,manslaughter NO . OH ,NO NO NO,.
Comment41	Give the yank a very serious spank!
Comment42	Hit and run.
Comment43	She needs to go to prison.
Comment44	Cowardly and dishonest
Comment45	This is devastating! I&#39;m an American and very moved by this. I signed the change petition as many should to seek  justice. She knew what she did was wrong, that&#39;s why she fled.  However, she doesn&#39;t want any repercussions, so she&#39;s hiding behind some privilege nonsense. She killed a teen by disobeying the laws of that country.  This is a very repugnant case that needs attention for retribution of some sort.
Comment46	White privilege
Comment47	bbc why you don&#39;t give diplomat one british taxi driver?
Comment48	And yet ran away from taking responsibility
Comment49	I never thought I&#39;d say this but.. Lock her up, lock her up!
Comment50	R.I.P in peace Harry Dunn.
Comment51	The brutal truth is probably that Sacoolas doesn&#39;t care one bit about who she murdered and their family,she just didn&#39;t want to go to prison,that&#39;s probably more accurate.
Comment52	She is a scumbag of a human. How can she be so devastated but not face the UK justice system. My deepest apology from one very disgusted and embarrassed  American.
Comment53	What is this &quot;immunity&quot; shit? A license to kill ?? Why should there be &quot;immunity&quot; they&#39;re above the law??
Comment54	Extradition must be enforced
Comment55	She&#39;s not a diplomats wife she&#39;s the wife of a spy and thus didn&#39;t have diplomatic immunity to begin with.
Comment56	MORE THAN LIKELY DWI!  SOBER AND GUILTY! Whats Next? ABOVE THE LAW! I,I,I, ME,Me,Me!
Comment57	Oh now she wants to meet lol... once her lawyer confirmed she is not covered by immunity! She ran because she knows it‚Äôs manslaughter death by careless action and she will be found guilty.  She thought she had a loophole to escape now that‚Äôs slipping away she‚Äôs oh so devastated
Comment58	Mr and Mrs Dunn, JESUS will give the both of you Strength and also Justice.<br />Harry Dunn RIP.
Comment 58.1	Isn&#39;t Jesus rather known for forgiveness?
Comment59	Then it&#39;s up to America to forcibly put her in a plane to face justice here in the UK. Or we have the right to send C.I.D personnel to arrest her on American soil and bring her back. A young life was lost because she was driving on the wrong side of the road ........ what is it that the lefties don&#39;t understand about all of this???????????
Comment60	My deepest and most heart felt condolences go out to Harry Dunn&#39;s family and loved ones. Politicians and the wealthy need to uphold the law and be subjected to the law when they break any law, they are by no means above the Law because of their wealth or their political associations.
Comment61	HIT AND RUN!  DONT PUT AMERICA IN THIS !   ACCOUNTABILITY!
Comment62	She committed a crime and needs to be held accountable.
Comment 62.1	Matt A - I thought you guys still use the guillotine? She probably would have been beheaded had she not fled back home.
Comment 62.2	Ironically in the UK she would have got a very lenient sentence however in her own country she would have been executed as the US still used the death penalty
Comment 62.3	She killed him in self defense. We gave her a trial in the US and found her not guilty.
Comment63	she is &#39;devastated&#39; that the family of a dead pleb has pursued her to america, whilst she is trying to placate her traumatised son, who had  to witness a reckless biker crashing into their car, who should have known she was american &amp; likely to drive on the wrong side of the road<br />once in a while; it was obviously just an accident, a mistake, but the parents of harry  dunn should have got over his death by now; how long has it been? 7 weeks?
Comment64	No she is not. If she was she wouldn&#39;t be running back to Uncle Sam protection
Comment65	WHAT A COWARD.
Comment66	So in the US gov eyes you can kill someone and get away with it if your a diplomat....
Comment67	Yes, she&#39;s so devastated she never even addressed the parents of the victim directly.
Comment68	LOL<br />ü§£ü§£ü§£
Comment69	Extradict this woman. Start petitioning. Get justice!
Comment70	Stupid laws
Comment71	American here, The US needs to send her back to the UK for justice.
Comment72	She&#39;s not a real diplomat. She&#39;s a fake one. Where&#39;s her responsibility and accountability?
Comment73	Just blame Trump. It&#39;s easy.
Comment74	So devastated that she fled the country almost immediately
Comment75	Probably another dumb cow texting while driving.
Comment76	I get it but wake up; you don&#39;t get to have arbitrary rules as it suits you.<br /><b>99.999% of the people outraged and spouting off with the claim of the moral high ground would accept the protection of immunity as well.</b><br />She didn&#39;t make a formal declaration of immunity, the embassy and later state department cited it to the British government <b>and they honored it from square 1 upon arriving at the scene of the accident.</b> <br /><b>The ultimate reality is if you are genuinely outraged, pursue rescinding participation in the 1961 Vienna Convention.</b><br />Nobody with a realistic view of how the world works and the destruction their life would face isi going to return to England after the fact and face going to a prison let alone a foreign one.
Comment77	If she is so sad why does she not allow her self to go to prison
Comment78	My heart goes out to the family and their lost son, hopefully justice is served
Comment79	Time to find out if the extradition treaty is really a two way street.
Comment80	Leaving the scene of an accident is a crime.  Every American knows that.  People don&#39;t seem to understand the difference between right and wrong anymore.  How did we get here?
Comment81	Justice for Harry, fuck you Anne.
Comment82	Saying immunity is &quot;no longer pertinent&quot; is not an immunity waiver.  You still do not have that waiver.  And you&#39;d need it to even begin extradition hearings.  Talk about misinterpretation.  As far as the meeting.  The mother already said &quot;sorry doesn&#39;t cut it&quot;.  Well it better cut it, cuz thats all you&#39;re getting.  And I take seriously issue with this womens claim that this is preventing her from grieving...really?  People whose loved ones are taken from them never to be seen again, their murderers will never be found...they manage to grieve.  Bullshit.
Comment83	She is a Criminal , Diplomatic immunity has been a sore spot throughout history. Now she thinks an &#39;Ops,  I&#39;m sorry.&#39; is all she is responsible to give . Deport her , charge her , and ejudicate her.  She is just a Self Entitled Brat that needs to face up to her actions. <br /><br />To the family of the slain &#39;May you find peace of mind so you can remember the beauty that was you family member.&#39;.
Comment84	I don&#39;t blame Anne Sacoolas for leaving the country, which was probably on advice from her US lawyer while she was in panic mode. She must have been terrified of the situation being in a foreign country. I don&#39;t blame a mother (A MOTHER WITH CHILDREN) of trying to protect her own children by fleeing to safest place she knew. ANYONE with children and the slightest sense would have done the same thing. It CLEARLY was an accident. The real blame in this situation lies on our own government for ALLOWING foreign drivers to drive in the UK WITHOUT INTENSIVE TRAINING FOR EXPERIENCE AND COMPETENCE TESTING.  <br /><br />THAT should be legal requirement for foreigners who come from countries where they drive on the other side of the road. It&#39;s pretty damn black and white. <br /><br />Therefore there is no justice to be had in this case. It was an accident that our government should have foreseen and did not act to PREVENT Harry Dunn&#39;s death. <br /><br />If you can&#39;t see that, then you&#39;re a <b>****</b> <b>****</b>
Comment 84.1	Well written - with the exception of the  unnecessary last sentence.<br /><br />Not only did you point out that Mrs S. shouldn&#39;t be blamed for leaving the country. You also made it clear that you cannot simply let people from other countries drive, without taking special measures to ensure they drive correctly. But of course such measures must also be taken by the country of the foreigner.
Comment85	Extradite her. Why should we protect her if she is guilty, and if she is innocent then the UK justice system will exonerate her. As an American I am throughly disgusted by this story and once again embarrassed by my government. What gets is that the British government is not doing much to pursue justice for this own citizen. Outrageous.
Comment86	FELONY HIT AND RUN said wat?
Comment87	Why did she run? She wasn&#39;t drunk at the time and it&#39;s the UK not the US prison system.
Comment 87.1	That‚Äôs what a lot of people have been saying Ironically in the UK she would have got a very lenient sentence however in her own country she would have been executed as the US still used the death penalty
Comment88	I hope they don&#39;t &#39;forgive&#39; her, it&#39;s what she wants! Why should she feel better about the situation while the family is hurting
Comment89	Devastated and she ran and hid behind bogus diplomatic immunity. The uk should throw the book at her.
Comment90	She wants to meet them... Only where she won&#39;t be held accountable. Words are easy. Actions...  What a coward! Apologies from this American, at least.
Comment91	You are a scumbag and a coward.
Comment92	How could she be devastated? She ran from the scene. That&#39;s shows noncompassion, no respect for the victim, and dishonor. I really she is locked up.
Comment93	If she doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúdiplomatic immunity‚Äù she should return to the UK, be made to return, meet the parents, and face whatever processes there are.  <br />As an American citizen, and if the shoe was on our foot, you bet I would be acting and questioning as well.  <br /><br />Absolutely shameful behavior, and our government should tell her to go back, face the consequences, and can‚Äôt return until the UK government releases her.  <br /><br />I can‚Äôt imagine the parents thoughts as they land here in the states, heartbreaking.  <br /><br />Yet another example of another government official abusing their power.
Comment94	If the US doesn‚Äôt extradite her I‚Äôm not sure we can forgive them. You can‚Äôt just kill Britons and run off.
Comment95	Myanmar government killing Rohingya people. Myanmar government burning Rohingya houses. Myanmar government rape Rohingya women. Myanmar government genocide Rohingya people. Myanmar government play game with rahohigya. I am a Rohingya. We went justice. We not believe Myanmar government. Myanmar government telling lay. We went back our citizens. We went back our rights. We went back our land. Please help Rohingya people. Please tell about Rohingya people.
Comment96	Reporting on this should divert peoples attention from the terrorist attacks in Manchester, Paris and in Halle. üëç
Comment97	She is basically over. She will forever be known as the rat who killed someone and then scurried back home
Comment 97.1	Aimee - I was just kidding about our laws superseding your laws, but she was probably used to driving on the right hand side and accidentally pulled out on the right side of the highway.
Comment 97.2	Ironically in the UK she would have got a very lenient sentence however in her own country she would have been executed as the US still used the death penalty
Comment 97.3	oh and here is a good recent example,  so recently a British diplomats comment about Trump being a worthless excuse for a human being etc  made the news.......  so what happened.. Boris Johnson  essentially got him fired ............  does it work the other way round... hmm dont think so ......  l
Comment 97.4	Aimee - She didn&#39;t kill him, it was an accident. It was the guys fault for driving on the wrong side of the road. Americans drive on the right side of the road, like all other countries. This guy was driving on the left hand side. It&#39;s your governments fault for not changing the laws to conform with the world. The US is a bigger country and a super power, so our laws supersede your laws.
Comment98	She was probably drunk or on drugs, which is why she left. If it truly was an accident, that is not a crime; thus she had no reason to flee.
Comment99	this is not fair that u said about anyone anything just like diplomatic think about that is not matter for any one please London news BBC news sorry from me if you mind that quratulain khawja karachi Pakistan best for London news and England news thanks
Comment100	She was so devastated she barely had time to pack her bag before jetting off to flee justice!
Comment101	Death shouldn&#39;t be far away from her kids the same way happen in England eye for eye the same way
Comment102	So much freedoms and human rights in the US to the extent that a criminal is free from trial and prosecutions...simply amazing!
Comment103	So Anne Murderer Sacoolas wants to make a statement but the parents have to travel to America to see her... <br />And, Anne Sacoolas is probably more devastated because of the thought she hasn&#39;t got diplomatic immunity
Comment104	... you see!... this is what happens when you kiss ass..<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />... you let political alignment interfere with civilian matters... <br />... what a price a couple has to pay for their gov&#39;t kissing ass.
Comment105	"<a href=""https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/cancellations-and-refunds-top7"">https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/cancellations-and-refunds-top7</a>"
Comment106	Is It me.... Or are they just really focusing on a story that connects England and America right before Brexit üëÄ.
Comment107	Another horrible American doing what they do best.
Comment108	Anne Sacoolas should come back to the UK and face the charges, fair and square. Show some personal integrity.
Comment109	She doesn‚Äôt even have diplomatic immunity! What a coward. His family cannot grieve until she takes responsibility.
Comment110	Why should the parents have to travel?! She should be made to get back here and face the consequences! She&#39;s not devastated at all!
Comment111	She is basically a coward - running back to the USA and claiming diplomatic immunity. Pure coward not facing up to her responsibilities!!! She must have a yellow streak right down her back as wide as her shoulders!!!
Comment 111.1	Denis - You&#39;re right, I forgot, that was France that had the guillotines. The English Monarchy had some kind of contraption that looked like a coffin with spikes inside of it, and they would close the person up in it and drive sharpened spikes through the person&#39;s body.
Comment 111.2	Captain America We people should bring back the dungeons and as far as guillotines go it was the French not the British that came up with that one!!
Comment 111.3	Denis - She probably doesn&#39;t trust the British criminal justice system. Wasn&#39;t that long ago that you people had dungeons and guillotines over there.
Comment112	If I killed someone I would never leave the country where I was responsible for ones death.
Comment113	But not enough to take responsibility for your actions
Comment114	Devasted.. but not devasted enough to return back to the country.. I would never be able to live with myself if it were me.<br />Her actions make her look like she did it on purpose.. If it really were an accident then what is she afraid of ?
Comment115	Why has this peace of shite left the country shall I tell you welcome to great Britain.
Comment116	gods chosen people are above our laws
Comment117	The answer is simple.  She no longer has D.I., therefore the Brits should do the paper work for extradition.  It will go before a US court, but I don&#39;t think the court will deny the extradition.  Return her to the UK for prosecution.  <br /><br />Having said that, what the hell are we still doing in Europe?  I&#39;m sure I could find folks who would say the US really had nothing to do with victory in Europe.  Once the Germans surrendered, we should have packed up and left and never returned.
Comment 117.1	You do realize your military isn&#39;t in Europe for our benefit, it&#39;s for your own? You want to be here, so you can have better access to certain areas of the world.
Comment118	She&#39;s a contemptible shit, running like that and &#39;devastated&#39; !... probably not as much as the family who lost their son Harry Dunn. She&#39;s scum.
Comment119	BS, see you in court.
Comment120	this devastated NOT DIPLOMATIC  IMMUNE coward get no sympathy!!  She RAN from an accident that killed a human being.  Being married to somebody with the US embasy does NOT mean you can escape the law!!  Own up to what you did coward!
Comment 120.1	You are ignorant or lying. like so many thickos here. She did not RUN from the accident. She was interviewed by the police.
Comment121	R,I,P     Harry Dunn
Comment122	For whatever it‚Äôs worth, this US citizen believes that the d-bag should be returned to the UK in manacles to face justice in the country in which the crime was committed. <br /><br />I believe that life contains a series of what I call ‚Äúintegrity checks‚Äù, and we‚Äôre given all the opportunities to do the right thing, even when nobody is watching. This d-bag took a young life, and instead of taking responsibility for her negligence, she cravenly fled the country. She should be brought back to the UK in chains, with a level of dignity to match her lack of integrity.
Comment123	Sudden devastation at the reality of having no immunity! Why no sorrow previously? Typical yank. üñï
Comment124	Trump has said she won&#39;t ever return to face justice.  Typical US &quot;justice&quot; RIP young man, and I hope your family copes as well as can be expected
Comment 124.1	The Blue Hotel Yea, this impeachment inquiry needs to keep building momentum, we can&#39;t let a crooked narcissistic idiot run the White House.
Comment 124.2	James T  I was heartened by the news clip where Trump said he would talk to Harry&#39;s mum and to Sacoolas. However, he repeated that it&#39;s easy to drive on the wrong side which is BS. Anyway, you cannot believe anything Trump says. We have to keep up the pressure so he can&#39;t wriggle out of this.
Comment 124.3	Ka Bar Brother Find the video that shows Trump accidentally showing his notes...again.  There&#39;s your source
Comment 124.4	Source, please?
Comment125	Now she wants to speak to family because legal action is being launched and she is not covered by diplomatic immunity - which by the way shouldn&#39;t be used to protect murders. Extradite her back to the U.K to face the music and then deport her and permanently bar her. She fled the country because she knew she&#39;d done wrong.
Comment 125.1	Kudzai Chisango yeah the police force that dealt with that accident should of charged her with driving without due care and causing a death, passport taken away. The uk government and that police force have done that family a wrong. It happened in August
Comment126	Cowardice, was she drunk ? Trump was protecting her too.
Comment127	Americans running off
Comment128	What the fuck is this?, lethal weapon 2?.
Comment129	As an American, I would like this murderer to meet with her victim&#39;s parents from a British jail cell.
Comment 129.1	I&#39;m Not a Gamer - You are correct. I should have used the work &quot;killer&quot; instead of &quot;murderer&quot;. I was very angry and embarrassed as an American that she had fled¬†British jurisdiction. &quot;Angry people are¬†not always wise&quot;. (Jane Austen)
Comment 129.2	Dana Chapin me also!
Comment 129.3	You are showing your ass!
Comment 129.4	Dana Chapi - Bite yo tongue youngin&#39;, the woman is an American hero for fleeing an unjust prosecution over this car accident. The limey&#39;s are just after her because she&#39;s an American and they&#39;re jealous of all our freedoms.
Comment 129.5	I‚Äôm Not A Gamer according to who ? She hasn‚Äôt even been interviewed yet,
Comment130	I can&#39;t believe how quiet all this is in America. When the majority of the population and/ or Philip DeFranco finally does a piece on it... There will be outrage. Heart goes out to the family. Keep screaming your story!!
Comment 130.1	4Shmorgishborg one word....TRUMP
Comment131	They want them to go to the U,S. So she dose not have to step back in to the UK and face justice.     (    ;
Comment132	So Harry&#39;s parents have to fly all the way to the US..to meet with this woman ..that killed her so   what a dam shame .. she should be back in the UK ..
Comment133	"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23AnneSacoolas"">#AnneSacoolas</a> <b>should face what she&#39;s done. she is not above the law. </b><b><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23HarryDunn"">#HarryDunn</a></b><b> and his loved ones deserve justice</b>"
Comment134	Diplomatic immunity is an important thing. If you start charging families of diplomats with crimes it could and most probably would give foreign countries in which the diplomats reside in an easier way of getting to a diplomat by easily enabling foreign countries to falsely accusing someone of a crime they didn&#39;t commit just so they could compromise a diplomat.
Comment 134.1	@blackham7 yes they should be immune again you can&#39;t give foreign governments a chance to compromise your or their Diplomats.
Comment 134.2	@Paul ConnellyConnelly Not necessarily true, it&#39;s still a terrible accident nonetheless. There is an argument that she had immunity in England where it took place, it was not in America so in America there is nothing that can really happen other than the family of the victim gets compensation.
Comment 134.3	Not in this CASE! This killer no longer has it, so there is no reason for her not to be charged? She was not set up! ------------------------------
Comment135	Why was she allowed to fly home when she had killed some one ??
Comment 135.1	Dexter Morgan I don‚Äôt think you are aware but a lot of people from Scotland are against the idea of being British and seek independence I don‚Äôt agree with British ideals and its history but this video isn‚Äôt the type of video to ‚Äúflex‚Äù or show off your nation as nobody cares, its about the loss of life of a young lad
Comment 135.2	aadrianlee - She fled back home because she was afraid she&#39;d be tried in one of London&#39;s sharia courts and have her hands chopped off.
Comment 135.3	Diplomatic immunity
Comment 135.4	Dexter is Irish, or of Irish extraction. Bets?
Comment 135.5	The Moto Scotsman  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Comment136	M U R D E R E R
Comment137	She‚Äôll meet them in the US but won‚Äôt meet Harry‚Äôs parents on British soil, of course typical, if she gets away without trial the whole of the US will pay for this
Comment 137.1	By whole of the U.S. you mean the working U.S. taxpayers i assume
Comment 137.2	‚Äú...the whole of the US will pay for this‚Äù.  How so?
Comment138	i consider this as psychological cruelty against a foreign car driver the family should face jailtime like TOMMY ROBINSON
Comment139	She doesn‚Äôt have diplomatic immunity.  Wait for the outcome.  Idyll speculation by tacky bbc news is sad.
Comment 139.1	Oooo edgy boi.
Comment140	She never had diplomatic immunity. Neither did her husband since his name was not on the list.
Comment 140.1	@Leebay1986 STFU TROLL üò¨
Comment 140.2	@Leebay1986 If you&#39;re not on the list you don&#39;t have the privileges. <br />And slipping the bouncer a tenner to turn a blind eye isn&#39;t going to work this time.
Comment 140.3	There&#39;s 100s more diplomats. Not all diplomats go on the diplomatic list
Comment141	She obviously thought the whole thing would go away by fleeing the UK, but where the heat has been well and truly turned up on her, she suddenly declares she&#39;s sorry (some 6 WEEKS LATER)  - I don&#39;t buy that at all (as don&#39;t many others). Even IF she is remorseful, it doesn&#39;t change what she did, and especially so by leaving - more like, she&#39;s FINALLY scared of the consequences from her own actions. I don&#39;t know if she and the family had been instructed to leave, but clearly it was her (and her husband&#39;s) decision to &#39;actually&#39; go - they didn&#39;t have to.
Comment 141.1	@The Moto Scotsman Yeah, totally agree - it&#39;s a complete disgrace, to say the very least, and I can&#39;t get my head around much of it (not just the fleeing from the UK, but the disturbingly lax attitude of the US government, and particularly Trump, with his idiotic and insensitive comments). I think part of the problem is, when attempting to even describe how terrible this whole scenario is, words (either spoken or written) just generally don&#39;t get anywhere near its sheer gravity, due to them mainly coming across as clich√©s, even though they may be correct (such as: disgraceful, despicable, travesty, disgusting and shameful, etc, which are all way too soft in my opinion), and therefore lack sufficient impact. Charlotte Charles (understandably), when responding to Trump&#39;s comments about it being &quot;an accident&quot; and &#39;these things happen&#39; (where he obviously missed the point completely), pretty much got it spot on, saying,  &quot;IT&#39;S BEYOND ANY REALM OF HUMAN THINKING.&quot; However, THAT clearly relates to the whole story, especially where (as I understand it), the family were initially abandoned by the authorities after they discovered the woman had fled the UK, and were therefore left to pick up the pieces on their own - so unthinkable, and ultimately unforgivable, coupled with the above.
Comment 141.2	Tim Smith 100% how she was never charged on the day of the accident is baffling, she caused a death, the police force and the uk government have let that family down. It‚Äôs wrong
Comment142	If this woman is responsible, for which she is NOT!!!, she needs to be confronted for her STUPIDITY!!!
Comment143	Never mind. Sent her to the UK to face justice. Horrible individual. A disgrace to the US and her country of origin. ŒñœéŒø !
Comment144	FREE ASSANGE
Comment145	&quot;US Diplomat&quot;<br />&quot;Wife&quot;<br /><b>Thumbnail is clearly a high school kid at best</b><br />Um... Please tell me you guys got the wrong pic? Otherwise, there&#39;s no way I can take this seriously, he&#39;s like 12, wtf? And he has a wife? AND is a US Diplomat? I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong, his death deserves some kind of something for the wife, but maybe she should date grown men instead of children?
Comment 145.1	The thumbnail is a photo of the victim.
Comment146	DEVASTAED PEOPLE DONT RUN
Comment147	I think we are witnessing the realities of the ‚Äúspecial relationship ‚Äú RIP Harry
Comment 147.1	This is the result of different roadway lay out. It is only going to get worse as time goes on. It needs to be change to conform to the rest of the world.
Comment 147.2	As an American I must apologies for David Barnett ignorance. To him the UK is just another foreign country that we used to help fight in WW2, forgetting that many US and UK soldiers died fighting together during WW1 and WW2. The UK allowed us to use their island to launch our allied attack on Normandy which the British fought hard to keep from the Germans in the Battle of Britain which for the most part could have changed the course of history had the British lost.<br /><br /><br />Now the special relationship I will admit is fading as time goes on due to people not caring for the past and the long history we shared. We at the very least will still have the same language and culture that will keep us intertwined for decades to come.
Comment 147.3	And the world would be a better place for it
Comment 147.4	As an American, we should have ended that &#39;special relationship&#39; on May 8, 1945 when the Germans surrendered.  Trump should do the right thing and pull all US troops out of Europe in general and the UK in particular.  The embassy in the UK should be downgraded to a mere consulate office.  There&#39;s no need for us to be outside the borders of the continental US of A.
Comment148	She deserves to give an eye for the eye she took. <br />Folks, please don&#39;t meet this woman without your lawyers or another witness. They&#39;ll prob want a non-discloser agreement
Comment149	Devastated ??? üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇthat‚Äôs why she ran out of the country like a rat !!! She should be in jail !!!
Comment 149.1	@Bang Bang NOT THE BIBLE, THE &quot;TALMUD&quot;
Comment 149.2	She is a rat...gods chosen rats, they use the bible to bs us all üòÇ
Comment 149.3	Don&#39;t forget she&#39;s diplomatic&#39;s wife.. They deserve more than us, they&#39;re better
Comment150	why the Canada can detain a Chinese HUAWEI executive for US but why the UK Cannot detain an American  especially she has killed a UK citizen?  what ashame<br />where is he justice? if she can get away from this does that mean anyone can go to UK TO do the same and fled with an apology ? got it
Comment 150.1	ayuicyi - We will give her justice in our American court system. We&#39;re trying to help the British fight global warming and putting her on a plane and sending her back creates too big of a carbon footprint. Sorry, but the health of the planet is more important than sending her back to face a trial. We already had a trial and she was found not guilty.
Comment151	Bullcrap ! If she is so devastated , she would never have left !  She was NOT the diplomat , her husband is . She should go back and tell the kids parents how devastated she is , then accept the sentence the court gives her , I&#39;m sure it would have been better if she hadn&#39;t left !
Comment152	So she thought she could just kill someone and then use her diplomatic immunity to get away with it. If she doesn&#39;t get extradited then that is a serious wobble with U.K.- U.S. relations.
Comment 152.1	@habirton The big golf course in Scotland tells me he&#39;s not ready to completely cut ties with us.
Comment 152.2	@matt Pretty sure he flipped off the world and said America First. Also, my comment wasn&#39;t an endorsement of the state of affairs, just an observation.
Comment 152.3	@habirton  Your President appears to feel rather differently about the subject. And since he&#39;s the one in charge, I&#39;m gonna listen to him.
Comment 152.4	Collectively, we don&#39;t care about the UK. We&#39;ll watch the royal baby/whatever entertainment, but honestly, collectively we don&#39;t care.
Comment 152.5	@The Blue Hotel Agreed I didn&#39;t even realize you could get her on that charge too.
Comment153	If it happened to a UK Diplomat in America, they would get the same protection.
Comment 153.1	@Tim Maes Not really
Comment 153.2	@John Davis This is way worse media attention compared to when they would&#39;ve stayed in the UK
Comment 153.3	@Tim Maes That&#39;s not true, but the reason of the fleeing is because the story would give them bad media attention.
Comment 153.4	The problem here is he wasn&#39;t listed as a diplomat with immunity and even if he was, it was the wife who killed that boy and she&#39;s not a diplomat.<br /> Her intent was most likely not to kill him as this was supposedly an accident but why would you run and flee to your home country while claiming immunity if this was the case?
Comment 153.5	John Davis  I hope we‚Äôll find out as the situation develops.
Comment154	She&#39;s devastated ? Imagine the family of this young man who&#39;s died ? They are the ones who are devastated.<br /> Our special friend the usa have let us down again.
Comment 154.1	@David Wallace Danke.
Comment 154.2	@Letty Lunasical I didn&#39;t see the UK volunteering to take over. Why do you expect the US to do all of Europes fighting. We aren&#39;t your daddy! Put your blood and treasure where your mouth is.
Comment 154.3	If it wasn&#39;t for us, you would be speaking German right now!
Comment 154.4	‚Äã@Louis Laszlo: You have got some nerve posting a comment like that. <br /><br />How dare you say &quot;just an accident&quot;. <br /><br />You do understand a young man lost his life and his family are grieving and looking for justice don&#39;t you?<br />Show some respect.
Comment155	The guy isn&#39;t even a &#39;diplomat&#39;, he is an NSA spy working on a US military base.
Comment 155.1	@Nehemiah Scudder Probably spying on the UK
Comment 155.2	Further to that, his name wasn&#39;t actually on the list of spooks granted diplomatic privileges.
Comment156	Sacoolas must be made to return to the UK to face charges.  No diplomatic immunity for **murder &amp; fleeing to avoid Justice.<br />**Edited.
Comment 156.1	@Felichia Ritter Since when was an accident murder ?
Comment 156.2	@David Wallace Excuse me, I didn&#39;t know that Harry was 19 &amp; don&#39;t see how how age is relevant.
Comment 156.3	@Fonzie   Murder is ok if the person killed is an adult, is that your response?
Comment 156.4	Harry was 19. How old do you have to become to be an adult in the UK? 30
Comment 156.5	@Fonzie that&#39;s how they need to be dealt with
Comment157	The coward ran away after murdering a 19 year old. Never let this be forgotten
Comment 157.1	@CallOfCody Well said.....Subscribing and following you....
Comment 157.2	Even though thats a troll comment sadly the combined IQ of America is about the equivalent of a wet pool noodle so i wouldnt be surprised if thats how you lot think.
Comment 157.3	Lucila - She&#39;s a hero in America for fleeing that unjust prosecution over an accident. You limey&#39;s are just trying to railroad her for murder because she&#39;s an American and you&#39;re jealous of all the freedoms we have.
Comment 157.4	@Lucila Romero and the son these people is dead forever....SHE(1) must return and face justice. SHE(1) should do so on her own, without the need for an extradition case. SHE(1) should not have run away. The question is why, while SHE(1) had diplomatic immunity did SHE(1) not bother to seek out the family before she left and make her apologies. Understand this SHE(1) can live in shame forever, along with a jail sentence, both can be achieved, it has happened before.<br /><br /><br />(1) Anne Sacoolas<br /><br /><br />and if you are still not happy with calling her SHE, even with he footnote I will correct it....by the way the name of the victim was Harry Dunn, just in case you forgot. Again if not happy with me calling her SHE(1), I will edit my post out of respect all you have to say is Please...and you have my word I will remove the word SHE(1) from this very post in this thread!
Comment 157.5	@Fonzie No not all. I am not the one who set up an account 4 hours ago, to copy and paste the same comment over and over again in this thread...Seems like you are the drama queen, not to mention a wannabe Troll. So calling me names has no effect...I don&#39;t know you you are not using your real name, so why would I be offended by anything you say....You insecurity level is amazing to say the least. Al least you are leaving others alone while you try a useless attack on me. If you had even a small amount of intellect it would not be hard to find me on any other social media platform. Fortunately you don&#39;t have that ability. You are what we refer to as a MANGO, of course that lacking intellect of yours would have no idea why I will from this point forward refer to you as MANGO.....P.S. This admitted KILLER, needs to return to Face Justice....From the way we have seen in the past week  that America treats its allies, no one is holding their breath.<br /><br /><br />So get some troll lessons or stop using COWARD SPEECH!<br /><br /><br /><br />Peace Love and Harmony<br /><br /><br />Paul Connelly
Comment158	She killed a man! Where is the justice! Sympathy behind a jail cell.
Comment 158.1	ALP7A - She killed him in self defense.
Comment 158.2	Not a man, a 19 year old kid
Comment159	She&#39;s so devastated that she ran away so she wouldn&#39;t have to take responsibility for what she has done,she is upset that people want her to take responsibility for this young man&#39;s death, not that he is dead.She&#39;s so upset that she is willing to met his parents,if the grieving parents are willing to fly to the USA.She is just another pampered ,spoiled, irresponsibility member of the establishment who refuses to play by the rules the rest of us riff-raff live by.It&#39;s not as if she was going to be locked up and have the key thrown away but she would have to take responsibility and allow these grieving parents a chance to complete their grieving process, that has been put on hold because of her.She may have been forgiven for an accident but what she did afterwards is just needless cruelty.
Comment160	diplomatic immunity should end over this it happens all over the world people getting away with crimes and claiming immunity its not right
Comment161	He&#39;s been &#39;dunn&#39; by her.
Comment162	What a coward and a disgrace. Apologies from an American.
Comment 162.1	@ stefan pereira: There&#39;s only one person who should be apologising and that is Anne Sacoolas (face to face in the UK with the grieving parents of Harry). <br /><br />As someone else has touched on, accidents do happen but that does not mean you are exempt from prosecution.<br />I very much doubt she will ever be extradited to the UK, and certainly won&#39;t come of her own volition.<br />While this does nothing for the UK/US relationship, my thoughts are with the parents of Harry, who have lost a son and have to accept that the person  responsible for his death will escape justice.<br /><br /><br />Shame on you Anne Sacoolas!
Comment 162.2	It was a accident...She didn&#39;t leave the scene that would be a Crime in U.S Justice...She stayed with Police then left. Who&#39;s goin to stay in another Country!
Comment 162.3	Alex Pritchard:  Yes, but she makes our whole country look horrible!  The whole of the UK are our brothers and sisters and I am ashamed for our behavior.  She needs to be punished, NO DOUBT!
Comment 162.4	not you&#39;re fault mate. don&#39;t apologize on behalf of an awful human.
Comment163	I hope she dies
Comment164	She needs to go back to the UK and face justice. Fuck her apologies, she needs to be extradited to the U.K.
Comment165	Yeah, typical US style: Thought and prayers but evading responsibility. If you are so &#39;devastated&#39; go face justice in UK!
Comment 165.1	Ask Mr. Robinson about UK justice.
Comment 165.2	Warrior Princess just ignore him. He‚Äôs obviously a troll because he‚Äôs nothing better to do lol
Comment 165.3	And a final point. I come from one of the most violent countries in the world AND I am old. I have been mugged four times in my life. Just one was successful.<br />The most amusing mugging was in the USA, in Atlanta.<br />The guy came from three quarters behind, a common technique. If you are wide awake and are looking the shop windows, you can spot him. As he was about to pounce, I swung on him and slammed him into the shops roller shutter window - repeatedly until a couple of people arrived. He ran away and the guys took me for a beer (actually too many beers!).  üòà<br />Even your criminals are...   just pathetic wimps.  üòÇüòÇüòÇ.
Comment 165.4	@Captain America That was a long tirade. So its specifically about STOOOPID blacks, the right to own a gun and keep and use drugs.<br />1. I am not English! My great grandfather and great grandmother and grandmother fought the English between 1897 and 1903.   OUCH - You got that wrong.<br />2. I am African and my friends are extremely bright.  OOPS<br />3. England, Austrailia, New Zealand, Canada all have murder rates one tenth USA so America should study how they do it.<br />4. There are a number of countries in Africa with a lower murder rate than USA. Your are 15 times more likely to be murdered in the US than Botswana. YES 15 TIMES!!!  üòà<br />- I bet you don&#39;t even know where Botswana is.  üòÇüòÇüòÇ<br />5. America is the only country that guarantees the right to buy and store MURDER WEAPONS. Can you work out why the USA has a murder problem?<br />6. Drugs, drugs, drugs. What can I say.
Comment 165.5	John -  Your laws allow someone to be criminally prosecuted and imprisoned for ten years, for causing a car accident, but you have criminals in London committing intentional murders with knives that get 3 years in prison?  Your courts are also unjustly imprisoning people under these hate speech laws, and one guy is facing 2 years in prison for posting a video of his dog giving a Nazi salute. You people need to join Tommy Robinson and start protesting against this tyrannical sht. The problem is, they&#39;ll use these hate speech laws and charge you with inciting hatred for protesting against the hate speech laws. Don&#39;t kid yourself, that government didn&#39;t enact those laws, because they&#39;r concerned about you getting insulted and having your feelings hurt, they have these laws to imprison and silence people like Tommy Robinson, or Jayda and Paul, that lead protests against their policies. They want to extinguish the fire before it starts raging and the protests escalate into uprisings and overthrow of their rule.  As for our murder rate, I&#39;m not disagreeing, England has always had a lower murder rate than the US, even before they had gun control. The US has a 6% black male population that commits 52% of all murders, which England doesn&#39;t have. Let us send these gang bangers to England and watch your murder rate go through the roof. Your gun control laws won&#39;t keep these hombres from getting guns. In the inner city black areas such as Chicago, St. Louis, and Baltimore, they have strict gun control at the city level, comparable to the UK, and the highest gun murder rates in the US. <br />   As for our high prison population, it&#39;s due to one person, former President Ronald Reagan, that started his war on drugs back in the early 80&#39;s. In the 1970&#39;s if you got caught with an ounce or less of weed, it was a simple traffic fine, but in the 80&#39;s the courts started sentencing people to prison for possession. A guy I used to know got caught carrying 8 joints in his luggage through DFW airport and the judge gave him 8 years in prison, a year for each joint. Times are now changing, and marijuana is being removed from the schedule one drug list, which includes heroin and cocaine. Many states are also legalizing pot, so we&#39;re starting to see an end to this mass incarceration and waste of billions of tax dollars.
Comment166	Why did she flee ? If he t was an accident, we the people are so thick for what we allow with our governments etc , one law for them .  RIP young man .
Comment 166.1	SHIRLEY DONOVAN  100% it‚Äôs so wrong the police that dealt with that and the uk government have let that family down.
Comment167	Is that woman so devastated that she killed a person or that she no longer has diplomatic immunity?
Comment 167.1	@Norrin Radd <br />I couldn&#39;t have said things better myself.
Comment 167.2	If she travels with he husband over seas she will have it back.
Comment 167.3	Madronaxyz. 1stly you would need to give some sort of link, to show what Obama did to whistleblowers, and what they blew the whistle on. Because I don‚Äôt remember hearing about anything, other than the right wing bigoted bullshit, over his place of birth, and their constant blocking his decisions, especially when he tried to help the majority of the people with universal(or as near as he was allowed to get it) healthcare free at the point of use, which was stopped by the incredibly high priced big pharma companies and their cronies in political circles.....<br />   2ndly, haven‚Äôt you seen anything that tRumpüí® and is disgusting brood have been doing, since the majority of the people had their vote ignored? Such as their profiting from the international contacts that he has got to help them, and his total bullshit on showing his tax returns, which he promised to show when he was elected by three hundred electoral college votes rode roughshod over the majority of the population. And then there‚Äôs his blatantly ignoring the emoluments clause of your beloved constitution!.!.!.!.! But, still you think that he COULD, abuse his power, talk about being blindly ignorant... Wake the fuck up, and smell the BULLSHIT, because it‚Äôs up to your bottom lip man........
Comment 167.4	@Norrin Radd I just don&#39;t see how my fellow American citizens fail to see that this sort of abuse of power could easily be directed at them by the Trump administration. However looking at how Obama treated whistleblowers I can&#39;t say that I could rest easy if Obama were president again.
Comment 167.5	Madronaxyz, that‚Äôs exactly why they gave her the protection of the unwarranted diplomatic immunity. And now we will see, exactly how special our relationship with the US really is. Because tRumpüí® has said that she is not coming back to be arrested........
Comment168	She cannot do it Lord Vishnu( Harry)
Comment169	Nobody gives a phuck about your apology. <br /><br />Drag her ass in Court.
Comment170	That&#39;s why she ran away after murdering a 19 year old.
Comment 170.1	@Fonzie What do you even mean. She killed that boy with a vehicle. Instead of being a responsible person. She uses her status as a American to run back to her country and quite literally throw away that boys life without a care. It&#39;s disgusting
Comment 170.2	@Paul Connelly If you use a real name it&#39;s OK to accuse innocent people of murder. Rofl
Comment 170.3	@Fonzie ----------------------and you are just a Troll looking to stir up crap....oh well! Your actions are much similar to the diplomats wife, a coward act, put your name to your comment or just continue to live in fear....You would not dare comment online without hiding your name.....that is just a sad reflection on you.
Comment 170.4	Murder ? Your a bit of a drama queen
Comment171	Diplomatic immunity for vehicular homicide?
Comment 171.1	"@Judi McAulife -  UN diplomats and Embassy staff try that in New York City.  It&#39;s not unheard of."
Comment172	This is horribly sad. I‚Äôve never understood diplomatic immunity. Don‚Äôt put diplomats into a country where they could possibly get arrested for political reasons and you wouldn‚Äôt need diplomatic immunity.
Comment173	She was so devastated she fled the country? Bbc why you you support people like this?
Comment174	If I was the father of the guy that was killed I would be more than happy to meet the woman<br />It would give me the perfect opportunity to stick a knife in her stomach a dozen times.
Comment175	Special relationship = Boris being Trumps poodle.
Comment176	I CAN TALK ABOUT THIS FIRST HAND BY LIVING THIS LIFE WITHOUT MY DAD AND A MISTAKE THAT TOOK PLACE TO MY DAUGHTER... <br />Face to face with the person who hurt my father and my daughter and to be heard would be healing at this point!!!! I can&#39;t change the pass that these doctors changed mine... My 30th birthday came regarding without my dad surprised he had planned to what I will never get to know.. And my 40th without my dad when he said he was going to have a huge laugh when &quot;his babygirl &quot; hits the big 40 and the big trip we were going to take to see all those fairytales he told me about will never be... When I was 8 my dad moved  to texas because his heart needed time to heal.. I got really sick.. and I mean freaken death sick.. I cried all the time, I did this thing with my dad at a time every night I would say good night day I love you, and he said he would say this at the same time to every night.. I feel like I&#39;m tripped in this sadness when he moved away to heal his heart.. waiting for my heart to heal when I seen him again, now its waiting for the doctor to say I&#39;m sorry I made an error with your father&#39;s life and I let my ethics that every doctor take and I over looked a life that belonged to a family who loved him... Has a this doctor didnt see my dad as a person, a father, a grandfather this doctor seen his as a drugie when my dad could no longer speak for his self he relied on his children, the doctors miss this part, the doctors thought he was on drugs when he took meds that caused a false positive!!!!! If I had the education today that I should have had back then I can tell you &quot;DOCTOR &quot; YOU WOULDN&#39;T HAVE ALLOWED MY FATHER TO BE RELEASED THAT NIGHT AND YOU WOULDN&#39;T HAVE MADE A MISJUDGMENT, AND YOU SURELY WOULD HAVE LISTENED TO WHY... This doctor will never see the night I cry in silence so i don&#39;t unsettle my daughter i can&#39;t say i have a husband now because see when i lost my father i lost me... i lost my family , Iost my home, I LOST!!! But I know now I won&#39;t loose again like that... Doctor&#39;s need to face the family&#39;s they hurt, they need to see the pain they caused! My sister needed my dad she has never been able to get life... She lives in her CAR DOWN THE STREET I CAN&#39;T HELP HER BECAUSE I&#39;M BUSY HELPING STILL FIX MY OWN FAMILY WHAT A SAD THOUGHT.. My brother needed his dad they never got that fishing day that day my brother was going to take him to a child&#39;s grave, my brother&#39;s best friend to whom a my brother and this child in time passed away because see my brother was a child with this boy in this grave who was his BEST childhood friend where these children played a game and the game where there was a distraction and footing fall this had an life that never came home to his mother that night, this child never knocked on our door asking to play with his best bud.. my brother.. that fishing day that was going to planned for the next summer 2010 where my brother was going to go with his dad to this child&#39;s grave THAT MY BROTHER NEVER COULD VISIT BUT OUR DAD SAID TO HIS SON MY BROTHER &quot;son it&#39;s time to forgive yourself for this&quot; I will stand by your side and guide you through this forgiveness..  Doctor that was supposed to take place the summer of 2010.. our father passed away in 2009 you do that math.. My brother went to his best buds grave... he finally did this last summer LAST SUMMER! 2019... He only took another friend one that was the same age one who childhood friend who was in this circle of friends.. she stood next to my brother on this journey... not my dad... my brother won&#39;t forgive himself and NOW BECAUSE I COULDN&#39;T TAKE MY DAD THAT NIGHT TO THE ER I SENT MY BROTHER THIS ONE TIME I TOLD MY BROTHER WHAT TO SAY.. I gave him my dads health run down for this week.. I told my brother what to say... <br />Now my brother won&#39;t forgive himself for this either... Good heavens PTSD must grow roots within us.. I have learned about PTSD.. And I learned about medications, I have learned what give a false positive I HAVE LEARNED that doctors can be wrong and IT&#39;S ok to speak up.. this has been very hard for me however learning to talk to a doctor and learning how to manage health and living with a health care circle will help you fight when sad judgment error like this takes place. <br />I know this is very long and I have so much to say that I have held in sense 2009 because see my dad taught me to kind, he taught me forgiveness is ok, and with 6 therapist now I can say I will forgive when I can have the face that made a huge mistake! I will not express anger no that&#39;s not who I am... but he need to see the face of a mans life he changed and tipped the balance of life to emptiness and loneliness, he needs to see what financial hurt he caused none of my father&#39;s child has job right now... For reason&#39;s that started the day my daddy went away. Nothing has been the same sense, I used to work out every day up to 3 hours each day. I never smoked or drank... After this I stopped every thing and pick up smoking, drinking (clean 1 1/2) years now only 1 social drink if that... I haven&#39;t stepped into gym sense 2009.... <br />This Oct 21 is my father&#39;s death date. <br />Please one day forgive those who took your baby boy away and love the memories that no can steal.<br />My heart goes out to you, get a grieving therapist and don&#39;t loose yourself to sadness. God bless both family&#39;s.
Comment 176.1	@invidinvasion I can see your one of those people who think without logic. So thank you for finding my pain so amazing. I wish you health and happiness and most of all love and compassion... don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t wish this for you to share with others... I wish it only upon yourself... Wish we all had or have lived under your city of zero compassion city... no big deal heartless... <br />Always this to help others to whom need it.. And I can see you waisted your time, this person who needed help with forgiveness and the power it does to ones life, so I bid you a good day.. and please be nice to those who are needing to be heard maybe only by the universe, but surely nobody needs your ill will and sad energy here... <br />Oh well good health and happiness
Comment 176.2	Wow! More therapy needed here.
Comment177	How to add a gross insult to a devastating injury. Offer an apology for killing someone&#39;s only son/daughter after you&#39;ve fled the country in which you caused the tragedy. <br />An apology to grieving parents is wholly inappropriate as is the term causing &#39;death by careless driving&#39; It&#39;s dangerous driving FFS. A careless driver might accidentally rear end you at traffic lights or dent your quarter panel whilst attempting to leave his/her parking space at the superstore&#39;s car park.<br />This does not account for the offence of failing to stop which can  see your bank account short of 5 grand and/or your removal from society for 6 months.  <br />She needs to face the music even though she won&#39;t like the tune played.
Comment 177.1	Harry is a twin!
Comment178	She would not even fly to see the parents....
Comment179	This is disgusting, the elite should not be able to get away with crimes just because they are rich and powerful, absolute scum
Comment180	REDICULIOUS. ... THE WIFE MUST FACE CHARGES  !!!!<br />ANNE SECOOLIS
Comment181	SHE DIDNT HAVE IMMUNITY IN THE FIRST PLACE ... HER HUSBAND WASNT AN ACTIVE DIPLOMAT ..... YOU DONT LOSE IMMUNITY WHEN U HOME , YOU LOSE IT WHEN JOB IS DONE
Comment182	She‚Äôs so devastated she used diplomatic immunity to get away with murder/manslaughter and fled the country.  I don‚Äôt think we care about that America pun women.  America needs to send her to the UK to answer for what she did.  Maybe the UK should consider pulling out of diplomatic agreements with the US if this is how it will be used.  It‚Äôs unconscionable.
Comment183	This is why women should be banned from driving. Bet she won&#39;t face any consequence because of her va-j-j.
Comment184	&quot;Sorry &quot; Is that it ,  wow that&#39;s got to be really comforting , just like when BBC said it  with their nonceing cover up .. scum must do better ...
Comment185	Good
Comment186	Would it not be great if every country on earth drives on the same side of road
Comment 186.1	We should all drive on the centre of the car like a go cart. Boom
Comment 186.2	Would it not be great if every person visiting a country abided by its laws.
Comment 186.3	Yes...all on the side of the UK
Comment187	We should just do the exact same with the US they dont extradite her then we shouldn&#39;t extradite People to the US... for example Julian assange, we should just release him. If it was the other way round and a uk citizen done that in America, our government would put them right on the next plane to the US.
Comment188	The husband was not a diplomat, so never entitled to immunity and the states told her to return home. This she did and so now she can be charged with this offence.
Comment 188.1	"@Rock Lover Thank you found the information instantly.....<br /><br /><br />PUBLISHED: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un4foy8uGVw&amp;t=05m49s"">05:49</a> AEDT, 26 February 2013 | UPDATED: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un4foy8uGVw&amp;t=18m37s"">18:37</a> AEDT, 26 February 2013<br /><br /><br />A 49-year-old man refused to pay his TV licence because he believed the BBC covered up facts about the 9/11 terrorist attacks.<br /><br />Tony Rooke, who represented himself today at Horsham Magistrates‚Äô Court in West Sussex, said he did not want to give money to an organisation &#39;funding the practice of terrorism&#39;.<br /><br />Rooke, who admitted owning a TV and watching it without a licence, was found guilty of using an unlicensed set, given a six-month conditional discharge and told to pay ¬£200 costs.<br /><br /><br />So he never won the case quite the opposite.<br /><br /><br />Forgetting 911, I find it outrageous that people in England have to have a TV Licence..<br /><br /><br />I am a journalist and find the idea of a fee to watch free television quite a contradiction.<br /><br /><br />Love Peace and Harmony,<br /><br /><br />Paul Connelly<br /><br /><br />Always Seek The Truth"
Comment 188.2	@Paul Connelly Tony Rooke  was the Man who Won against BBC over Building 7 Collapse
Comment 188.3	@Paul Connelly Video ... Historic Court Case against BBC TV licence .Channel Ban TheBBC
Comment 188.4	@Rock Lover No about the UK TV Licence case.....I can&#39;t find any information from any level of court in the UK...
Comment 188.5	@Rock Lover Well did you happen to see in there which court handled the case....? Because a search of records throughout the UK has not turned up any documents or court cases concerning this,, I would like to narrow my search...
Comment189	The husband was not a diplomat, so never entitled to immunity and the states told her to return home. This she did and so now she can be charged with this offence.
Comment190	Is She Deeply Devastated , Or just mildly Devastated  ???   Words are Cheap......Come Back to the Crime Scene and Answer to the LAW
Comment191	The arrogance of those fuck*n Yankees is unbelievable !!!
Comment192	"Devastated , fk g joke , she s runaway like a rat from the sinking <a href=""http://ship.now/"">ship.now</a> she says whats her lawyer tells her to say"
Comment193	This woman has finally crawled out from under her stone. Its a hit and run plain and simple. She should face the UK for prosecution . That poor family needs justice
Comment 193.1	Diane Sikora the initial reports in America are that she stayed on scene but lied to the cops on the scene.
Comment 193.2	DISTRACTION MEDIA.. THE WORLD IS ON FIRE
Comment194	American firstÔºÅ
Comment195	This will not be another rant about that woman.<br />She should not have to be extradited, she should face up to her actions Now!<br />She has no conscience, firstly she would not have run away.<br />Secondly she hasn&#39;t got a heart or she would be back in UK, in fact, should never have left it.<br />Shame on her.<br />I don&#39;t care who she is, what she is, it is not dissimilar in respects to Andrew, the Queens favourite son. <br />He has no honour or conscience either. <br />The proof is out there, get it, prosecute him and he should serve a very long sentence in a normal prison.<br />In some Countries, he would be beheaded, despite their so called Rulers allegedly known for similar proclivities doing it, yet ordinary people, Gay people are beheaded in a humiliating manner after first spending a lot of time in their gell holes and being tortured.<br />He should consider how lucky he is to live in UK.<br />She should consider her actions and their consequences.
Comment196	She‚Äôll say anything to get away with vehicular manslaughter, the nasty fugitive  .... she needs to be extradited pure and simple
Comment197	So devastated that she left before helping the police by answering questions ü§î , Why should they have to travel to the Usa ?! She should do the right thing and come back to the uk selfish individual
Comment198	One law for them <br />One for the rest of us
Comment199	So &quot;devastated&quot; she lied and then fled the country.
Comment 199.1	Why do she flee the country if she had Diplomatic Immunity she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to be arrested anyway unless the US ambassador choose to waive the immunity (which is rare) the best the UK government could do is declare her persona non grata in which case she would have to leave the country within a specified time. But they couldn‚Äôt arrest her
Comment 199.2	@Cejay Adkins Actually you don&#39;t skip a scene like this otherwise you&#39;re immediately guilty of a hit and run.
Comment 199.3	@Yassine St but was she really responsible?
Comment 199.4	@Cejay Adkins staying and take responsibility for what she did?
Comment 199.5	She returned home? What else what she have done also innocent until proven guilty??? We dont know the circumstances of the crash
Comment200	A article by Former UK Ambassador Craig Murray says he was never a Diplomat .See Gordon Dimmack channel for details .
Comment201	Extradition, a coward that should face justice. It will be a stitch up, she will return face charges and walk free with a slap across the wrist.
Comment202	She is ‚ÄòDevastated‚Äô by her stupidity!? ‚ÄúGet your fat ass back to the UK and face up to your responsibilities you cheeky mare‚Äù! ‚òòÔ∏è
Comment203	Gosh I&#39;m shocked the right wing isn&#39;t out in droves protesting the utter contempt America clearly has for British citizens.
Comment204	Dare I ask, her Diplomatic Immunity has been removed.<br />Why couldn&#39;t she fly to UK to see them?<br />After all, she used her POSITION to run away?<br />The excuses about driving on other side of the road etc<br />Thousands of UK Citizens go to US, Europe, other Countries.<br />First time I drove in France I kept reminding my brain about the correct lane.<br />I had 4 children eldest 15 plus their Father.<br />I had them to think of also other French Drivers who were nothing if not brilliant, noticing reg, indicating, you go.<br />I wonder was she alone or anyone with her?<br />I could well be wrong but I do not recall hearing if she had passengers.<br />I drove in Germany, in one of the busiest regions, going to fabulous pool complexes they have which you don&#39;t even know are there until you get to parking area, surrounded by beautiful trees.<br />I had 4 children with me, only one mine. Again I was very conscious of the children, but the other drivers were important if I got it wrong, they could lose their lives through my not being alert.<br />She should have taken responsibility.<br />My 2 brothers left with life effected and for a long time, life threatening leg injuries through hit and run. One was 16 stopped in inside lane in line of traffic. Authorities tried to convince my Father he fell off.<br />My Dad looked at his bike, saw coloured paint, had accident investigators do their stuff. He had indeed been stationery, if he fell off, why was his right thigh, leg and ankle in bits. Eventually when Authorities were prevented with make, model year etc, no reg, driver behind the culprit was too busy trying to get help and save his life. When he was asked again to recall derails of car in front, after 2 years he confirmed make colour, but was more interested in the wee boy. Traffic was at a standstill, had just started to move saw my brother, leapt out. He was his priority. Investigators confirmed his vehicle had quite a bit of damage re severity of damage to bike and him. If Police had listened to the gentleman who came to his aid, they might have traced that person.<br />Like this woman they knew he had to know he had hit something, he never came forward, obviously. My brother has lived with the painful consequences all his life. Cannot walk straight.<br />Like her he ran away knowing he had hit something pretty hard.<br />Thank God my brother survived, 3 operations in days, no expected to live. He did.<br />Their son didn&#39;t, and her message is very carefully worded.<br />In fact, it&#39;s meaningless.
Comment205	Omg the accident happened on August now already October obviously she has no remorse ü§¨ and Saying she is sorry after victim families working hard bring her to justice and went viral ü•∫ <br /><br />I hoped she go to jail for the death teenager and flee UK  !!! She can fake and dropping some crocodile tears ! ü§¨ yet still she going to jail !!!!
Comment206	This sort of thing has happened frequently in the US; usually it&#39;s the son of some foreign diplomat. Not saying it&#39;s fair or right, though. Prayers for the poor parents who lost their son.
Comment207	So devestated that she left the scene of the crime, and left the country...
Comment208	England has a &quot;special&quot; relationship with the US, right?! <br />ü§îüëàüèª
Comment 208.1	Well let&#39;s say in a military way.
Comment 208.2	That&#39;s what I have been led to believe
Comment209	People die everyday from stupidity of other people. But it&#39;s not fair to have immunity when you kill a person, accidentally or not. But don&#39;t worry, if human law doesn&#39;t reach to those blue collared individuals, karma sure will sooner or later.
Comment210	She is so devastated she managed to avoid the police station and run to the airport to run away
Comment 210.1	She is devastated that she left her favourite dildo behind when she pissed off.
Comment211	THE PARENTS ARE COOL....I WOULD WANT HER NECK ON A BLOCK..RIP HARRY.
Comment212	"This is tragic but she needs to be brought through the judicial system.Sympathies to the Dunn family. What do you people say on this accident? üåπ"
Comment213	10 August, Epstein. #1<br />27 August, Mr Dunn, 19, #2
Comment214	Extradite the killer of this young man to face justice for her cowardice and crime
Comment215	now britain gets a taste of how America treats its &quot;allies&quot;
Comment 215.1	@HooDatDonDar I got friendly fire casualties from official figures - perhaps you should actually check before saying it is false, and trying to make this about politics.<br />(Note - casualties, not deaths)<br />Also, she is apparently never going back to the UK, so how is she not getting away with it?
Comment 215.2	@Ari Onassis-Sugen Stop having sex with every Tom, Dick and Harry.
Comment 215.3	Mindless anti us stuff.<br /><br />Where did you get that info about friendly fire?<br /><br />UK and US are firm allies, whatever whinging leftist may not like it. She won‚Äôt get away with this.
Comment 215.4	Save your insults. She&#39;ll face justice.
Comment 215.5	@Ari Onassis-Sugen The world is introduced to you and given a reminder of what a fool actually says. When presented with the death of a young man, you go on about abortion.
Comment216	(‚Ä¢_ ‚Ä¢)
Comment217	Meanwhile Assange rots in a British supermax an innocent man at the behest of Britain&#39;s imperial overlord.
Comment 217.1	The ABSOLUTE TRUTH
Comment218	*Just a Diplomat&#39;s!
Comment219	FAKE NEWS. He&#39;s not a diplomat, he&#39;s a spy. She&#39;s not devastated, she&#39;s guilty and ran away
Comment 219.1	Search &quot;Craig Murray , Diplomatic Immunity&quot; <br />Craig is a former UK Ambassador and his own story is fascinating .
Comment220	USA is a joke for the world
Comment221	It&#39;s great that diplomatic immunity doesn&#39;t apply now and Anne Sacoolas can be brought back to the UK to face prosecution. I think that is now the case because reading between the lines Trump has had a word with her and mentioned that diplomatic immunity no longer applies to her in the USA  and she can now be extradited back to the UK for trial of the UK so wish!
Comment222	BBC stop telling how devastated she&#39;s and bring her back to face justice
Comment223	Oh wow she should have said that earlier like when she hit the poor guy not with his lawyer across the atlantic and claiming immunity.
Comment224	"rap <a href=""https://youtu.be/ebd8bdorcaA"">https://youtu.be/ebd8bdorcaA</a>"
Comment225	She wants to meet the parents? So, is she going back?  She should go back.
Comment226	Something smells a little suspicious?
Comment 226.1	See Gordon Dimmack channel
Comment227	Who cares about your chicken Apology. Go own up to what you have done. That Innocent boy deserves that much.  Especially his family.  Your a coward not worth looking at or up to.
Comment228	Sympathies to the Dunn family. This is tragic but she needs to be brought through the judicial system
Comment229	To Harry&#39;s parents, do not accept this woman&#39;s apologies, she is a hit and run killer fugitive.
Comment230	subscribe me All friends
Comment231	Deep apologies? The coward should bring herself back to the UK and face justice. If the coward had done this in the USA, her cowardly backside would be in jail in an orange jumpsuit.
Comment 231.1	@Mat Broomfield ln the USA they take vehicular accidents/crimes very seriously. If she had been British and the same thing happened there, her passport would have been removed and a high bond given out because she would have been regarded a serious flight risk. The only thing I am not sure about is the diplomatic immunity bit, anyway the British courts are far more lenient and she would probably have been given bail and not seen jail at least until the verdict.
Comment 231.2	Probably not. The wealthy rarely pay for their crimes.
Comment232	Meanwhile the BBC gave me all the immunity for life!
Comment 232.1	@Da Da Don&#39;t distort the history. Comfort Women was a crime committed by the Japanese, but in the video it shows the Koreans (the victims) being the perpetrators. You should be ashamed of yourself.
Comment 232.2	"Goku vs Jiren.¬† CHA-LA¬† HEAD CHA-LA DBS super remix image.<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/9G3faHp-sMM"">https://youtu.be/9G3faHp-sMM</a>"

Comment 232.4	And the BBC is proud of having done so. Remember the time they protected the child grooming gangs, because the perpetrators belonged to the &quot;peaceful&quot; community.
Comment233	I don&#39;t get it why would she want to declare immunity because she was involved in a car crash if she&#39;s done nothing wrong why doesn&#39;t she let the police Investigate her instead of leaving the country?
Comment 233.1	@Mat Broomfield your right mate she&#39;s already made herself look that she wants to go to jail.
Comment 233.2	She was driving on the wrong side of the road when she crashed thus causing a death by dangerous driving in UK law which can hold upto seven years in prison if proved in a court of law. So she&#39;s done a runner in panic. The letter is effectively an apology to try to duck out of justice. <br /> But she no longer has diplomatic immunity by running back to USA so can now be legally extradited back to face UK justice
Comment 233.3	But she DID do something wrong. It was an accident but she committed the offence of reckless/dangerous driving. She could face 5 years in jail for that.
Comment234	Goodness Gracious she needs to come face the UK law!
Comment 234.1	Sir Jimmy Savile the problem with the UK judicial system the fact remains that the victim will ‚ÄúNEVER‚Äù receive justice from a UK court.
Comment 234.2	A bit surprised you`d imitate a known criminal, giving justice advice ... &quot;Hows about that then&quot;,  odd and a bit warped!!!!
Comment 234.3	The Fonz - You&#39;re probably right, the media attention is the reason they&#39;re out for blood and wanting to criminally prosecute this woman for an accident. I don&#39;t envision any western country doing something like this. Apparently the UK does have laws on the books that allow the courts to do this though.
Comment 234.4	You let Jimmy Savile off the hook, so you need to drop the charges against this American woman. We already looked at the case and found that she was not guilty of killing the adult kid, it was an accident. Why was he driving a freaking motorcycle on a busy highway? I&#39;m not blaming him for the accident, but they are dangerous as hell and it&#39;s stupid to ride them on the highway.
Comment 234.5	@Captain America I`m in Britain and if she is found guilty of anything its only because of media attention not because shes a bad person.
Comment235	That&#39;s sad
Comment236	Make her stand trial!
Comment237	so much for the &#39;special relationship&#39;, she should be extradited
Comment 237.1	It&#39;s a relationship but nothing special about it. All countries have a relationship with the USA
Comment 237.2	Our relationship is special in the same way as a rape victim has a special relationship with his/her rapist then goes on to develop Stockholm Syndrome.
Comment 237.3	@ConfusedPanda Doubtful.  Wouldn&#39;t his base need to travel. Can they afford that?
Comment 237.4	Agree and hey the usa is going into a civil war if the cuolp comes
