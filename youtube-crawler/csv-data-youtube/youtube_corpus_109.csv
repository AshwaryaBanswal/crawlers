Comment13	FECE BBC
Comment14	In Japan, it’s very rude to call the name of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor.<br />Please don’t call Emperor Naruhito. Please call the Emperor or the Emperor of Japan.<br />Also, Japanese names are in the order of family names and given names. So the name of the Japanese prime minister is Abe Shinzo, not Shinzo Abe.
Comment 14.1	Koyama Yutaro この天皇の皇民じゃないですからよ、例えば俺と天皇は同じ人間で、完全に平等です。脱亜入欧はまだまだですね　日本国民は
Comment 14.2	okay i see. Mr. Naruhito &amp; Shinzo Abe !
Comment15	The shit royal families&#39; members and people of Japan are all evils, killing many innocent civilians and other ethnics around the world and stealing many country’s treaury and gold. They should all be eliminated or tortured to death and then eaten by animals. They also should all be exterminated for their sins.
Comment16	Those countries who still have emperors ang kings are faithfull people! Not overtaken by traitors

Comment20	Japan was founded in 660 BC by Emperor Jimmu, who was said to be a direct descendant of the sun-goddess Amaterasu.<br />2019y  126th Emperor
Comment21	Japan is a great country, I hope it never becomes ‘diverse’ 👌
Comment 21.1	Someone doesn&#39;t know about Japan nor it&#39;s history.

Comment24	I can&#39;t believe this was controversial for economical issues. This is almost like a liturgy. It should be declared World/National Heritage.
Comment25	Democratically elected eye surgeon Dr Assad, who just cleansed the US/UK etc  backed ISIS et al  from his lovely country,   is also a  top world dignitary.  Who instructed the J to not invite him, or are they the noo truth keepers.  SHAME!

Comment30	The substantial Japanese ruler is &quot;Shinzo Abe&quot;, and the Japanese Emperor just a scarecrow.
Comment 30.1	Abe is the Prime Minister. The monarch, Naruhito is the Head of State.
Comment31	Big Kudos to Japan for keeping Their traditions going. Absolutely Beautiful to see!
Comment32	Could Japan invade China?<br />💩
Comment33	Japanese is already a beautiful language but somehow when the Emperor was speaking, it sounded more elegant and majestic.

Comment35	<b>ITS RYAN MAGEE FROM SUPER MEGA</b>
Comment36	The emotive issue of Japanese wartime atrocities continues to undermine relations between Tokyo and its neighbours. It has fuelled nationalist sentiment in China and Japan, risking a dangerous escalation. The suffering of an estimated 200,000 victims from South Korea, China and other countries was marked and remembered around the world. But Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent a ritual offering to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which honours Japanese war dead, including convicted war criminals. Abe did not attend the shrine, as he did in 2013. However, the sending of the offering – on the anniversary of Japan’s surrender – was insensitive. Japan should understand the depth of Chinese people’s feelings about the wartime atrocities. The grievances are genuine and they will not fade with the passing of time. Japan issued an &quot;apology&quot; concerning comfort women in 1993 and a deal with South Korea was done in 2015, which included funding for victims. But that agreement has been much-criticised, as it was struck behind closed doors without input from the victims and was seen as lacking sincerity. Apologising only to South Korea is rightly seen as an insult to the rest of Asia, who are well aware of the racial taxonomy subscribed to by the Japanese elites. <b>A sincere apology is needed from Japan, and compensation for the victims of all nationalities.</b>
Comment 36.1	You are brainwashed by stupid war propaganda to control dumb mass.<br />Learn true history. A lot of secrets have been declassified.
Comment37	御即位おめでとうございます。
Comment38	A lot of people see absolutely nothing unusual or wrong, with preserving monarchs and emperors, in the 21st century. But Japan has never properly apologised for its war crimes, nor have they compensated all the countries they brutalised and raped. <b>At least the Germans have the intellectual maturity to face up to their past,</b> and now Germany is comparatively, a progressive country. The <b>Japanese imperial family, murdered countless millions of Asians;</b> Japan&#39;s self-indulgent, myopic &quot;shame culture&quot;, prevents them from every facing up to their crimes. I hope that Brits who enjoy this spectacle, remember that their grandparents know better, especially if they were enslaved and forced to build railroads in Asia, by a previous Emperor. It&#39;s not &quot;all in the past&quot; for Asia, because as mentioned, there has never been any attempt at reconciliation by the Japanese state. <br /><br />Japan is a democracy, and the current generation are blameless in relation to the country&#39;s past, but it is very far from being an &quot;open&quot; society. Japan is technologically very advanced, and their culture has much to be admired. But Japan is not (and never has been) a (small &quot;l&quot;) liberal democracy; it is a <b>one-race nation, with laws similar to Israel designed to keep it that way,</b> which is why there are no minority communities in Japan. The ones that are there, have very low status, and cannot progress within Japanese society, because they are <b>&quot;gaikokujin&quot;</b> i.e. non-white foreigners. Thus Japan is itself a victim of it&#39;s own myopic race laws, and cannot solve its demographic crisis without immigration from it&#39;s immediate neighbours, which of course, it will never allow.<br /><br /><b>Where are the Ninja&#39;s of Iga, when you need them?</b>
Comment 38.1	<b>Remember cruel Chinese and Korean killed millions of civilians each other during Korean war. lol  Curse your own brutal evil people.</b>
Comment 38.2	No wonder you Koreans are hated everywhere.<br />You are brainwashed by your stupid war propaganda.
Comment39	Certain old traditions such as this are to be cherished.

Comment 43.1	@Roy Batty They already apologized dozens of times and also paid reparations to the Republic of Korea and China.

Comment44	BETWEEN JAPAN AND UK ARE GREAAT LANDS OF THE DISTANCE ,<br />THE MUTUAL  SIMILARITIES  OR DISTINCTIONS   HAVE FORMED AND ARE PRESENT  THERE<br />TO GET TROUGH ALSO,THE DISTANCE
Comment45	Japan is lit af
Comment46	He should meet with the Queen of England.
Comment 46.1	He did, often, as Crown Prince of Japan.
Comment47	Total deviation from our constitution... Where is the separation of religion from politics? The emperor looking down on a PM congratulating is just against one of the basic principles of the constitution that the sovereign power resides with the people.
Comment 47.1	The constitution says he&#39;s the symbol of Japan, so this is not inappropriate. He&#39;s just like a national flag.<br />And some <b>traditional</b> rituals can be carried out by administration, even though those rituals are religious.
Comment48	Definitely not like the trashy British royals.  The Danish royals look fantastic and then there&#39;s Charles nodding off...
Comment 48.1	@John Texas I&#39;m not. I do work for PR/Media before and we have subject to cover. Since this is a big event, there was a code of importance to share the spotlights. Japanese Gov&#39;t. failed to invite the big guns from U.S so the media are covering the famous faces here.👌
Comment 48.2	@J V Gullible.
Comment 48.3	Blind.🙄He&#39;s reading the pamphlet for the event since the t.v was too much on their seating position. And FYI, Japanese media took a great interest on his presence, the Danish couple were just a tag.👌

Comment54	Just hope you don&#39;t intend to launch another war like your predecessor.
Comment55	Velly goodo.
Comment56	Japan is a truly extraordinary country.  If a small island can conquer hundreds of millions of people in asia then become the world&#39;s second biggest economy it shows the discipline of it&#39;s people.
Comment 56.1	@Roy Batty Chinese, American and British killed millions MORE.
Comment 56.2	@Roy Batty You are brainwashed by stupid war propaganda to control the dumb mass like yourself.
Comment 56.3	@Roy Batty Yeah people die in war.  What is your point?  Germans are talented people, most of the world&#39;s inventions and science has come from german scholarship.
Comment 56.4	What it shows is that they are a brutal and savage people, when nationalists take over the country. Conquer? They slaughtered millions, that must make the Germans VERY talented people, because they killed 6 million jews. Come on, that can&#39;t have been easy right? Seig Heil
Comment57	I wish hapiness!<br /><br /><b>Shoots cannons</b><br /><br />:|

Comment59	Its great to witness a real traditional ancient ritual, the Japanese people are very honourable. Its a pity that the CHINESE COMMUNISM GOVERNMENT cant do the same because theirs no such thing as a communist emperor, that would dishonor Chinese traditional ancient history to the core. 🤣😂🤣😂
Comment60	Didn&#39;t know they still had emperors.

Comment65	Emperor plays the same role as the queen of UK?
Comment 65.1	SC Workout so that why they have to keep on having children and stuff to keep the country ?
Comment 65.2	Draw WithJazza <br />The Japanese emperor is symbol of japan.<br />Japan was founded by 1st emperor of japan and that family has been 2679 years living until now so it means japan is oldest country in the world.<br />when that royal family will be end, “Japan” will no longer as well

Comment80	This guys family and grandfather was directly responsible for the atrocities committed by the imperial forces in the Second Sino-Japanese War and in World War II. They still have not apologised for the rape of Nanking
Comment81	BANZAAAIII!!! From England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🇯🇵 You have a beautiful culture, tradition and people Japan, cherish it.
Comment 81.1	@Kirsten Dirken That&#39;s true. My Filipino friends shared his grandfathers story. He clearly remembers Korean were more cruel than the Japanese soldiers. Japan targetted the military but sneaky Korean targetted babies and women. They bayonetted babies and raped women. Korean did exactly the same atrocitities in Vietnam. It&#39;s disgusting that Korean don&#39;t acknowledge their war crimes during WW2.
Comment 81.2	@Killy &quot;tianno heiga banzai&quot;(天皇陛下萬歲)means &quot;long live the emperor&quot;.during ww2, we they launch a bayonet charge, they all shout&quot;tianno heiga banzai&quot; crazyly.
Comment 81.3	@Killy &quot;banzai&quot; means &quot;long live&quot;(in Character 萬歲or萬載 I guess )
Comment 81.4	perhaps you don&#39;t know the famous &quot;banzai charge &quot;in WW2
Comment 81.5	Rose Madeleine <br />Hey, so you’re calling me dumb and idiot while you got proper education? Then send me links of those testimonies about Korea being the real villain of world war 2. Wait you can’t. It’s only in your imagination. Better not believe those cause your brain is likely damaged by radiation! Or did irradiated monkeys in your nation made false testimonies? No surprise that. ;)<br />Dear god, TIL animals could imitate humans with keyboard. Maybe sending a bomb or two again will save us and stop them from killing our earth with their radiation.
Comment82	this video is uploaded on my birthday oct 22😊
Comment 82.1	@なんとかエル どうもありがとうございます
Comment 82.2	Happy birthday, wish you a long long health and happiness.
Comment83	Based Japan.  They seem happy, strong and doing just fine in their homogeneous society.  Let&#39;s hope they never suffer the fate of parts of Europe, the disease of multi culturalism.
Comment 83.1	@Roy Batty lol my reply to your comment was deleted.  But hey.  Nothing wrong with their &quot;racist&quot; laws, their society&#39;s done pretty well for the last few thousand years and will continue for millennia I&#39;m sure.  Western European ethnic groups on the other look in serious trouble due to  breeding under replacement rate compared with that of migrants and non natives.  That&#39;s not racist, it&#39;s maths.  Look up Pew Research study of UK demographics as source.
Comment 83.2	Oh don&#39;t worry, they have racist laws that prevent them from being an open and tolerant society. That&#39;s why there are only Japanese in Japan, they are ageing and facing demographic decline as a civilisation. They will never pay for the crimes committed by the Emperor.
Comment 83.3	Shrimpy you’re right poverty, racial inequality, And crime would probably be bad for their homogeneous society.
Comment84	Japanese traditional ceremony with morning dresses and gun salutes...which have been born in Western Europe🙃
Comment 84.1	The gunners have terrible aim.....
Comment 84.2	石井宏明 <br />I think so
Comment85	Congrats 🎉
Comment86	Everyone please be respectful. All the best and a happy future Japan.
Comment 86.1	Fuck Akihito, queen Elizabeth and all the monarchs of this world.. i am sadly surprise people still tolerate  and even worst, respect this clowns today.. we should all take away their economic and social benefits and get them a job at waltmart or something..
Comment 86.2	@Roy Batty Yes how dare people have their own culture, traditions and heritage!<br />Anti-monarchists are some of the people I have the least respect for in politics.
Comment 86.3	@Roy Batty &#39;&#39;U.S empire&#39;&#39;   lol
Comment 86.4	Fuck that, why do we have monarchy in the 21st century? Japan is an infantalised pawn of the US empire, and prevent Asia from being a united force which can stand up to the US and its lackeys.
Comment 86.5	Previous month I was able to withdraw my first five figure income ever!!! I&#39;ve been working for this provider using the internet for 2 yrs now and I never been happier... They are paying me $95 per hour, and the most desirable thing about it is the fact I am not really that tech-savvy, they just asked for basic insight into internet and common typing skill...The best thing about this is that I have more free time with my kids. I am able to devote quality time with my friends and family and take care of my children and also going on holiday together with them very often. Don&#39;t skip this chance and try to act quickly. Here is what I do <b>foryou49­.­c­o­m</b>
Comment87	Hard pass on emperors, kings, and monarchs in general... this has a bigger impact on society than one may think.

Comment 90.1	@inkitatus1 thats the dumbest argument ive ever heard, at least if we vote them in we can get rid of them if they are evil shits<br /><br /><br />we cant do that with inherited monarchy lol dumb idea
Comment 90.2	Roy Batty please read the last 3 years of recorded Brexit 😉
Comment 90.3	Please read the last 6000 years of recorded history. Hereditary rule is the worst kind of rule ever invented.
Comment 90.4	no

Comment92	I like his hat 🎩
Comment93	They have pretty private and low profile ceremonies. Should be more grand... it’s the Emperor for f*ck sake
Comment 93.1	Not if the taxpayer are paying for it. How about they march through Asia, inviting people to throw flowers at them?
Comment94	As long as we still have monarchs I know in which Zeitgeist we live.
Comment95	If you&#39;re not Japanese and discrediting emperor or making a joke I recommend you to be quite and respect people&#39;s culture. I&#39;m not Japanese and I&#39;m Indonesian, we are happy to know this.<br /><br />Don&#39;t be ignorance and bigot.
Comment 95.1	Agreed. Just a shame people don&#39;t defend English culture in the same way.
Comment 95.2	@ID GAF Everyone can express opinions without being limited by anything, whether they are appropriate or inappropriate.  Freedom that does not follow etiquette and manners can create problems for others.  One example of suicide rates due to cyber bullying.  Honestly, your statement is very toxic to many people.  Indeed, everyone is free to express an opinion, but still follow the prevailing norms.<br /><br />Yes this is internet, but we are human, not artificial intelligence.
Comment 95.3	People can say what they want lol its the internet, stop trying to control the internet xdddd
Comment 95.4	I’m Japanese. I’m full of gratitude.
Comment96	*God Bless Japan!
Comment 96.1	@Giovanni Martini my pleasure : )
Comment 96.2	@なんとかエル I see. Thank you very much!
Comment 96.3	@Giovanni Martini I don&#39;t know why, but we don&#39;t think it less divine. Like you never think yourself less Martini (if you  use real name). Have you thought your family name has got less by less? But only who has that Y chromosome can be the emperor of Japan.
Comment 96.4	@なんとかエル Wow, thank you very much! So I guess every generation is a bit less divine... because they mix themselves with human women, right?
Comment 96.5	@Giovanni Martini first emperor of Japan was the grandson of the god AMATERASU, sent from God&#39;s land to unite the world (Japan), according to tradition. <br />After finishing duty in human&#39;s land, his majesty turns back into god and goes back to god&#39;s land. (Controversial)
Comment97	BANZAIIII
Comment98	"I hope he can stand up to fascist China.<br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/o-8SsGVuhWM"">https://youtu.be/o-8SsGVuhWM</a>"
Comment 98.1	Actually, I hope China will stand up to the puppet of US imperialism. China is the only country in Asia that can lead Asia, Japan are pawns of the US, they will never act in Asias interest, because they look at Asians as savages. From the invasion of China in 1937 to the end of World War II, the <b>Japanese military regime murdered near 3,000,000 to over 10,000,000 people, most probably almost 6,000,000 Chinese, Indonesians, Koreans, Filipinos, and Indochinese,</b> among others, including Western prisoners of war. This democide was due to a morally bankrupt political and military strategy, military expediency and custom, and national culture (such as the view that those enemy soldiers who surrender while still able to resist were criminals).
Comment99	小日本，去死吧！
Comment 99.1	@Shengwei Gao Remember the history that Chinese government killed over 80 Million innocent civilians  and still torturing and killing Tibetans and Uyghurs. China is Nazi in Asia.
