Comment1	China no good for the world
Comment2	We don&#39;t need to drain it after all.  Let the swamp boil.
Comment3	I thought BBC only liked posting everything pro Hong Kong.
Comment4	this looks so staged, not even funny
Comment5	What happened to the Hong Kong I know and love? Its now destroyed by recent events
Comment6	BBC cuts the moment that attacker stabing with his entire  force. Please see the full footage.
Comment7	The way of reporting is somehow leading people to think of a suspected drama.<br /><br /> VERY NASTY!<br />Very Nasty! <br />Do you have a child? <br />Do you educate your own child?
Comment8	Get well soon, Junius. That attacker will rot in jail.
Comment9	he made a good movie
Comment10	So fake
Comment11	How do you miss the neck?
Comment12	No surprises. He is Chinese. Free Hongkong, Free tibet
Comment13	Shame he didn&#39;t have a gun...
Comment14	I know this sounds creepy, but... you don&#39;t stab the chest. That&#39;s where people have that big hard protective thing. Attacker failed Stabbing 101
Comment15	that was not a crazy person trying to attack him.<br />he don&#39;t want to tell the truth that was a (Hit Man) He thought<br />people would have Rushed back that Hit Man got the opposite!!<br /><br /><br />I guess president Xi wants him dead this is the start of a deadly war for Hong Kong<br />wait till the bodies start showing up for anyone that is opposing the apposite positionðŸ˜®
Comment16	The man called a guy who tried to kill him mentally ill despite the smoothness of the potential murderer. In my opinion, the lawmaker has a good heart because most pple including me will want that guy on an electric chair instead of saying his mentally ill.
Comment17	Oh wow.. he did that move quick.. holy shit..
Comment18	interesting title. you didn&#39;t use: pro-democracy supporter stabbed pro-beijin lawmaker.
Comment19	"I&#39;m quite confused why BBC see Mr Ho as a controversial <a href=""http://politician.is/"">politician.Is</a> Pro-beijingï¼Œtheir central government ï¼Œcontroversialï¼ŸOr is loving his country controversialï¼Ÿconsidered as a heroï¼Œé»„ä¹‹é”‹ is widely praised by western mediasï¼Œeven though  he is a separatistï¼Œa traitor to his country.maybe BBC just can&#39;t  recall that Hong Kong is not part of UK any more.waving a UK flag while in the rally is much more controversial"
Comment20	What a senseless violence! The suspect will likely spend much of his lfe behind bars.
