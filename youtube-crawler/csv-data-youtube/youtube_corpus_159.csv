Comment7	It&#39;s conspirators when actively supporting rioters and terrorists.
Comment8	GOD ALMIGHTY MOST HIGH, STOP THIS VIOLENCE AND OPEN THEIR EYES TO SEE THE TRUTH.
Comment9	I actually filed a complaint to the BBC about their bias against the Hong Kong police. They replied to me &quot;Thank you for your email about bias against the Chinese Government&quot; wtf?! I didn&#39;t mention the Chinese Government. Seems the BBC think they are one and the same. If we complain about the NYPD would they reply &quot;thank you for your complaint about Donald Trump&quot; or the West Midlands police force &quot;Thank you for your complaint against the UK Government&quot; of course no. So their BIAS was simply proven. They are therefore a multi billion pound propaganda machine in favour of the rioters! The BBC themselves are helping to destroy Hong Kong. I can leave but many can&#39;t
Comment10	protecting terrorists???????
Comment11	stupid, shame on you.

Comment24	破坏地铁，性侵，保护示威者很好吗？无辜市民警察谁来保护？
Comment25	Yo how much can I make if I leave a comment saying that they are rioter
Comment26	These stupid protesters have been brainwashed by the evil western media which tried to undermine China as a country. Why the camera ignored the scenes when the terrorists throwing bombs at the police and hitting innocent civilians? Why BBC reports are so biased?
Comment27	香港老傻逼！你们为了几万元，把孩子们害了、把香港害了。日你妈糊涂傻逼！

Comment32	CHINA ❤️ PEACE<br />WORLD ❤️ PEACE<br /><br />Stand with PEACE
Comment33	Shame on you people unethically using RELIGION and GOD to protect illegal protestors and violent rioters and dangerous vandalism
Comment34	JESUS condemn all illegal protests riots violence vandalism
Comment35	GOD condemn<br />illegal protestors and violent rioters and dangerous vandalism
Comment36	It is legally and spiritually WRONG to protect illegal protestors and violent rioters and dangerous vandalism
Comment37	Shut the fuck up pls. Thanks for your Hypocrisy and dirty support for  terrorists in Hong Kong. Hopefully, such a beautiful things can happen in Belfast or Scotland every year, especially attacking, gasoline bombs etc.💥 God bless innocent and dog will bleed those bitchy journalists who work for British Brainwash Comaony (BBC).
Comment38	Protecting London&#39;s young protesters!<br />It&#39;s so ironic that even in Hong Kong protests are not totally banned.
Comment39	Wow. That police officer tell an 80yoa man to come on. Wft communist police.
Comment40	CONDONING IS NOT PROTECT.
Comment41	Hey BBC.. pls stick to your BBC Earth documentary.... I think those are more credible than your double standard news reporting.
Comment42	A real hypocrite. Got the cheek to even make use of a 80 year old senile old man. Shame on you. Just to act hero and achieve your hidden agenda you put an old man at risk of being hurt?
Comment43	Good on u all protection people, good to see United
Comment44	BBC = Bullshit Broadcast
Comment45	The police deliberately antagonize the people to give them an excuse to use violence. This is all part of the script the Chinese communist party uses to justify the  unlawful actions  they are perpetrating on their own people. All to keep the rich elites in power.
Comment46	the reason you see so many china paid trolls in bbc channels, is because all of them are students or mainland chinese living in the uk. these chinese people were brainwashed in china since kindergarten before they came to UK.
Comment47	Shame on you! Fake mercy! You even use a religion to encourage the youngsters to become rioters and commit more crimes!
Comment48	It&#39;s amazing how I am unable to find a single news report by the mainstream western media on the hk police who was slashed on the neck by one of the protester. It shows how bias and selective news are disseminated to the western public to achieve their own agenda; ie. to support pro democracy protest in the country. The ironic thing is, the western media always condemn the censorship rights in china, when they are in fact doing the same thing. Seriously, they should stop their nonsense and hypocrisy, and be more open minded in accepting other countries way of governing.
Comment49	"Police slashed in the neck, homemade bomb, petrol bombs, burnt down shops, the whole subway network had to be shut down for days due to heavy damages. I would think that will be called TERRORISM in UK not Pro-democracy! <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3032714/flash-mob-protests-flare-across-hong-kong-groups-smash"">https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3032714/flash-mob-protests-flare-across-hong-kong-groups-smash</a>"
Comment50	BBC, Where are the videos of Spanish police brutality in Catalonia?
Comment51	香港人需要正面能量，謝謝您們的付出🙏🙏🙏👍
Comment52	Why BBC don’t even press the London protests and the polices had arrest thousands people?
Comment53	All of the negative comments on here are by mainland Chinese who are brainwashed by the Chinese Communist Party!!! It is so saddening to see all of these individuals supporting a totalitarian regime that is holding Muslims in concentration camps and torturing them, a government that is fabricating the news and lying about the protests, a government that tried to cover up a 15 year old boy getting shot in the chest by saying he was holding a metal pipe when it was really plastic pvc, a government that ruled it a suicide when a 15 year old girl (a strong swimmer for her school team) was found dead and naked in a body of water after she had clearly been raped and murdered and they quickly cremated the body to get rid of evidence, the government that allows the police to beat people on a train until they are unconscious and then deny medics to get on the scene for over 2 hours, a government that allows its police to brutalize journalists, break the arms of a first aider, and arrest people for simply wearing a black shirt.....this is the government that these people blindly support. This is the government that the Chinese are brainwashed by, that they can’t even open their eyes to the reality when they leave their country. I am disgusted by these comments. If you want video evidence of the police brutality against Hong Kongers please let me know.
Comment54	Unfair news
Comment55	protect their violent behavior? Why dont you protect people who are in the metro stations?
Comment56	"Who push the children onto the street at first place?  Polician, school, church, media....  crazy<br />Look at this <a href=""https://youtu.be/HYXnPxoNgC8"">https://youtu.be/HYXnPxoNgC8</a>"
Comment57	Hello people of Youtube, I have come to provide a different perspective of the Hong Kong &quot;Protest&quot; <br /><br /><br />First I would like to say that I see many Western Media trying to glorify the protesters and paint them as a movement of fighting for democracy and freedom, and frankly it&#39;s disgusting.<br />Yes, I get that China is highly authoritarian and they got some really shady stuff going on but come on lets be honest here, every country in the world has their fair share of shadiness. Especially the US.<br /><br /><br /> So let me just try to summarize this;<br />Hong Kong protesters are no longer just &quot;Protesters&quot;, many of them are starting to act like anarchist or even terrorists.<br /><br /><br />Sure many protesters are still legitimately peacefully protesting but for the violent ones?<br />Lemme just list out what have they done so far:<br /><br /><br />- Vandalism  <br />- Destruction of Train station facilities that resulted A LOT of delays for everyday commuters<br />- Throwing molotovs at police officers, police buildings<br />- Destruction of CCTV cameras, traffic lights<br />- Setting up barricades to block traffic<br />- Attacking citizens with different political views, or trying to remove barricades (including elders btw)<br /><br /><br />There is more of course but I think you get what I&#39;m trying to point out here.<br /><br /><br />I would like to highlight there while there IS cases of police brutality, and I also heard rumors of multiple victims that supposedly committed suicide was actually killed by corrupt authorities (this is a RUMOR,  take this information with a grain of salt), it does not justify the violent acts of these &quot;Protestors&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Don&#39;t believe me? Then check out these Youtube channels to verify for yourself:<br /><br /><br />South China Morning Post <br />CGTN<br /><br /><br />Still don&#39;t believe me because these channels are biased? Then check out Youtuber &quot;Jaron Lines&quot;. A independent Caucasian  journalist in HK. <br /><br /><br />P.s. Can someone screenshot this before it gets deleted or smth
Comment58	These are no young protestors. They are criminals and should be shot the minute they hold up a weapon against anyone including the police...this is the American democratic way...Your freedom should not be at the expense of others! Teenage and old fools!
Comment 58.1	its funny to hear that u from.. i bet u never had the fear of losing democracy..
Comment59	Fight for freedom, stand with North Ireland! North Ireland needs to be free from those UK monsters.
Comment60	香港政棍犯民不死, 香港社會只會更加撕裂脫序百業蕭條，當人民難以生活時，誰還在乎一國幾制
Comment61	BBC BRITSH BULLSHIT CORPORATION
Comment62	fake mercy. You should tell the children to go back to school. Do not play politics.
Comment 62.1	when ur democracy at stacks ull see urself doing teh same shits..
Comment63	Christianity for some reason is very culty in HK, thanks to the deeply rooted superstitious culture among the HK people, who adopt the religion for very selfish and stupid reasons.  They really think they can all go to heaven if only they accept Jesus before they die, and all their sins will be forgiven.  How nice it is to commit murders and still go to heaven by accepting Jesus.  As bad as Mao was, the one good thing he did was to get rid of the superstitious BS in China that had handcuffed the country&#39;s development for thousands of years.
Comment64	When the kids beat someone who disagrees with them, do you protect the someone and stop the violence? Do not sully Christianity and Jesus.
Comment 64.1	@Wayne Wang The Chinese Communist government is very corrupt.  It could very well be the case that they are deliberately committing acts of violence through a proxy and arson so that the demonstrators are blamed.  This happens in many countries around the world.
Comment 64.2	@Greg Grimer and how about ARSON then
Comment 64.3	It depends why they &#39;disagree&#39;.  If the child they beat up is bullying another child or torturing a cat or dog or selling drugs, then I would congratulate my child for being courageous enough to use violence.  Violence has its place and uses.
Comment65	Just look at how the French crack down at their protectors before making any comments about Hong Kong.
Comment66	Come on UK 🇬🇧!!!<br />Do something, take action!!! So soft!!<br /><br />US🇺🇸,Japan🇯🇵 and Australia 🇦🇺 always step in... to maintain and secure free speech and democratic in Pacific-Asian region.
Comment 66.1	Come on United Kingdom !! Fast your speed to release Scotland and leave EU with no pain. US Japan Australia always step in for support , please :)
Comment 66.2	R M Really?  Then why China with the second largest population country need other country’s government step in? You said take action! What kind ?? Scotland is looking for independent , should China take actions to support any side? Secure Scotland ‘s democracy? Ridiculous
Comment 66.3	Can you read? You are not very smart...
Comment 66.4	R M you are funny! You wanna create World War III I truly believe
Comment67	The ignorant communist sympathizers below,<br />Hong Kong is currently under an illegal occupation by the PLA disguised as the police. Many draw the comparison of the current situation with that of the period during WWII where the police on the street behaves very similar, if not worst , to the imperial Japanese Army at the time. That is , residents are constantly being threatened with physical harms.  Given the circumstances, if Japanese shops and Occupation Gov facilities were vandalized, who among the residents would cheer and who would be upset but the (Japanese Sympathizers- Enemy of China).  These are the people who would call the vandals- rioters.  But many cheer for them and recognize the brave Volunteers and very much inspired by their bravery and sacrifices...
Comment68	fuk you riots
Comment69	OMG , why add more fuel to the fire by bringing in religion? Can this old man not make the <b>rest of us Christians look like idiots</b> ? Religion does not solve everything , a hard fact that even a man in his old age must realize which is sad because he never found that out on his own.
Comment70	fake news
Comment71	Yeah, protect young HKers from “riot” police, so that they can smash, burn, bully and loot “peacefully”! 🙈
Comment72	BBC, you&#39;ve lost me the last bit of respect toward you.
Comment 72.1	BP specifically British Brainwashed Criminals
Comment 72.2	BBC stand for Bullshit  British Criminals
Comment73	LIAR！Shame on you! As a journalist, you don’t tell the truth, only report one side of the situation. They are not fighting for freedom, they had bad intentions, many of the protesters used violence to create chaos and make messes. They cannot solve any problems by doing so, you know that! DO YOU BBC HAVE CONSCIENCE？SHAME ON YOU！
Comment74	CCP has to go .China needs to get rid of the ccp.
Comment75	All the video about Hong Kong only shows police beat people, but never shows the people beat the police. Many years ago, I believe freedom and democracy are wonderful things. But now, thanks to the BBC, you let me know what is hypocritical.
Comment76	Everyone is sure they know what Fascism is; &quot;A chauvinist demagogue haranguing an ecstatic crowd, a disciplined rank of marching youths, colored-shirted militants beating up members of some demonized minority; surprise invasions at dawn; and fit soldier sparring through a captured city,&quot; —— Robert Paxton<br /><br /><br />Fascism may be defined as a political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood, and by compensatory cults of unity, energy and purity in which a mass-based party of committed national militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandon democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraint goals of internal cleansing and external expansion. —— Robert Paxton
Comment77	Every time Christianity plays the role of savior to participate in politics, the countless times of history prove how terrible the hypocrisy of Christianity is.
Comment78	If Chief executive officer Carrie invite Mean Superme leader Kim Jong un will invade in HK then millions protest  and riots get stuck with Dictator in future?
Comment79	death to Communism

Comment83	These young (stupid) protesters are destroying public properties, they should be protected? They should be sent to prison.<br />BBC shame on you. If your British youngsters wear masks and destroy London subways 🙂
Comment84	Do you know Gandhi ?????<br /><br />Recall Gandhi’s spirit “non-violence, non-obeisance” and select a leader and talk with government.<br /><br />We don’t want to see Hongkong people beaten by police, nor Hongkong people destroying things any more.<br /><br />Violence will bring about nothing but “hate”. Nobody respects you if you do violence, the world will start respecting you if you stop violence and talk with government gently.<br /><br />Let me tell again to recall Gandhi’s spirit “non-violence, non-obeisance”.<br /><br />I’m a Japanese, I’m being afraid of Hongkong and Hongkong people as a friend of yours. I’m really wishing you settle down this peacefully.<br /><br />Anyway, please be safe and gentle.
Comment 84.1	Hi, Aaron, thanks for your explanation which makes me understood Honkong people’s idea ,esp. when they use violence.<br /><br />I’m in Japan as I said, recently we have had few chance to see the situation in Hongkong on TV ,,,,,, for about these a few weeks there’s no televised about Hongkong <br />situation, although we saw Hongkong news almost everyday before a few weeks, so as of today most of Japanese have no way to know about the current situation on TV, so I’m afraid many people would be getting lose their attention on Hongkong issue.
Comment 84.2	Hi
Comment 84.3	Hi, people of Hong Kong understand and appreciate Gandhi&#39;s ideal. In fact there was a great divide between the non-violent protestors and protestors who use force before this movement. However, the government ignored many peaceful assemblies and processions against the extradition bill - 1 million people joined 9/6 march; 2 million people joined 16/6 march; and 1.7 million joined 18/8 march. If the brave protestors hadn&#39;t confronted the police on 12/6 with no protective gears, the bill would have been passed. Protestors using force are still highly restrained. There are some rules of using force: no force used on innocent citizens, only use force when necessary (eg attack), only use force on CCP-related parties and use proportional force against attack. It is not violence, it is self-protection. If there had not been a forceful resistance in UK and France, there would not be Magna Carter and the French Revolution. Trust me, no protestor wants violence too. Many of them are highly educated and have a stable job/ education. They were forced by the government to sacrifice themselves to fight for freedom. Please stand with Hong Kong.
Comment85	Those kids violate the law. Protect them from the law?
Comment86	Do not use God&#39;s name in vain, my dear brother.  As a pastor you should know better.  Jesus is the Prince of People.  He will not advocate violence and vandalism.   His message is  “for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.&quot; He said this the night He was betrayed and unjustly arrested when one of His disciples drew a sword to try to defend Him.<br />Your action will encourage these kids to continue to be violent.  The police will have no choice but to respond to protect private and public properties and the lives of innocent peace loving citizens caught up in this violence. <br />The police action are just and when these people resist arrest the situation will also look brutal, no matter how gentle you want the police to be. <br />The Bible teaches respect for governing authorities.  Pastor should know better.  Here&#39;s what the Bible says in case you don&#39;t know.<br />Romans 13:1-2 NIV<br />Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.<br /><br />Speak the Truth.  Stop encouraging these young children if you really care for them.<br />Teach them to respect the authorities. Encourage them to go back to their anxious, grieving parents. <br />Do not give the Church of Jesus Christ a bad name by what you do.

Comment104	At least, Chinese IQ is higher than fat Americunt and Britich. Color revolution can&#39;t success within China. We are not Ukraine, Egypt, Tunisia, Libya etc. Britain should receive these 2 million protesters giving them British citizenship. That&#39;s win-win solution. Britain pays for its 154 yrs colonization period sin in China, and HK people get their freedom. If not enough, HK people could build a country called Hong Kong within Britain. Then problem solved.

Comment107	protect criminals is also a crime.
Comment 107.1	Hui Liu crime is crime, they are not kids, they are criminals, they are over 18 adults. Even tho they are under 18, 守护孩子的应该是他的监护人，未成年人不代表可以伤害别人，希望阿sir们该开枪就开枪，那些说守护孩子的人，你们是在利用你们的孩子做挡箭牌，真正想保护自己的孩子，就让他回家。
Comment108	Just today 8/13, rioters stabbed a riot police officer, beat up an undercover officer, and one of the rioters hit the officer on the head with a knife.<br />Is the BBC still lying and not afraid of god&#39;s judgment?
Comment109	This is a bloody misallocation of valuable resources and time for everyone!
Comment110	What I think a lot of people are missing here, is that we should be supporting anybody who tries to end conflict peacefully, regardless of their race, age, gender or religious beliefs. Violence solves nothing, it creates a cycle of anger and hatred. Not being from Hong Kong I can&#39;t truly understand the scope of what is happening there, but my heart bleeds for every person struck by a police officer, for every person beaten by senseless mobs, and for every officer who gets attacked by those same mobs. Violence is easy, quick and destructive. Peace is difficult and slow to achieve, I know this, but that does not make it any less worthy a goal to strive for.
Comment111	香港人不打香港人，說的很好啊，那為什麼要打警察，打政見不同的老人 呢，你也說了有看到廢青打老人，對方二十多人你們好歹也7人小隊啊，拉架都不敢為什麼，還不是怕也被打，但你們中有老人沖警察大喊大叫卻是敢的又是為什麼，還不是知道只要不動武警察就不能拿你們怎麼樣，警察本就是暴力機關，是維護法律的啊，那些廢青不犯法誰會動他們，被逮當然是違法了，年輕人那麼大膽違法還沒有後果，對他們有好處嗎，長大后也照樣打老人嗎，老了以後再倚老賣老，無恥一生嗎？和平示威我支持，覺得表達自己觀念挺好，政府不回應有一千種和平的方式逼迫政府回應，為什麼那麼快速就變暴力了，沒人組織，煽動，誰信！

Comment117	&quot;The thief’s purpose is to steal and kill and destroy&quot;<br /><br />Jesus said &quot;By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A GOOD TREE CANNOT BEAR BAD FRUIT, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.&quot;  <br /><br />Real Christians should be blessing instead of curse.  They should be the light instead of the darkness.  They should build, build, and build instead of being destructive.  I never understand why they called themselves Christians but they incite, support, and protect those stupid kids that execute terrors and vandalism.<br /><br />The protestors and their supporters only peacefully want more freedom.  Freedom to peacefully attack and hurt other people and police.  Freedom to peacefully hurl rocks, bricks, hard objects, and petrol boms to other people and police.  Freedom to peacefully terrorizing others and police and ruining public properties, airport, government buildings, and business places.  Freedom to peacefully conducting riot to forcefully brutally rob other people freedom to travel and conduct their own livelihood.  Freedom to be hypocrites by viciously attack and silence freedom of speech and freedom of expression of those that speak and express their mind but have different opinion than them.  <br />Freedom to peacefully destroy and totally decimate Hong Kong future and HK people&#39;s business and daily activities.... What a bunch of spoiled stupid clueless delutional loser criminals.

Comment 143.1	@Random potato <br />Other people don&#39;t think that way , but Chinese under PPC certainly wish to immigrate out of it if they could .. many did already....
Comment 143.2	@Random potato <br />All these argument saying China&#39;s own way verses Other&#39;s way... as if everything could be your own way.   .. Standard CCP reasoning .  It&#39;s an excuse to have a privileged CCP ( a few gang members ) ruling over 1.4 Billion people. <br /><br /> &quot;iguarantee to be free of getting into trouble with the government&quot; <del>-means CCP doesn&#39;t believe in human right.   Any time it can make up charges against anyone it wishes... Even you today are so supportive of the current regime -</del> and the word is no guarantee tomorrow that what you&#39;ve written here supporting the current CCP policy will not be considered counter revolutionary in the future when the Party changes its policy.... There were many examples of such ... Throughout the PRC 70 years of history
Comment 143.3	@DOUGLAS MAN Lastly , what makes you think people would leave their homeland and country just because of a certain dissatisfaction ? If everyone did that, then no country in the world would be stable. People who are not satisfied with Trump&#39;s rule would leave America which would total up to millions of people. Hong Kong would only have half of their population left if everybody left just because they are not satisfied with the social and living environment currently. These are just some examples of situations based off your current perspective. <br /><br />People are not that cowardly. Humanity has strived and survived much more. We will strive and survive again. People would not simply abandon their homes or lands of their ancestors and everything they love and know just because of a dissatisfaction. You forgotten about the spirit of patriotism and the love most people have for their countries. Even when you see people moving, working or studying abroad , it&#39;s mostly because of better job opportunities or better education. If they had those back in their own countries, most of them wouldn&#39;t choose to go.
Comment 143.4	@DOUGLAS MAN I also want to highlight and question what do you mean by &quot;guarantee to be free of getting into trouble with the government&quot; ? To fully apply and understand this phrase , you should first look at China&#39;s political ideology. For example , China&#39;s political system validates that it can block sites on the Internet that promote Western or democratic ideas. Thus, if citizens use or access those websites , they will definitely be getting into trouble with the government because they violated China&#39;s rule of law. It all comes down to a simple sentence. 👇🏻 <br /><br /><b>China&#39;s political system of governance plays a huge factor in the rule of law, same goes for other countries.</b> For further example , in Islamic countries, Islam would play a huge factor in their rule of law. In Western countries, democracy would influence their rule of law. <b>You simply cannot claim that a foreign country should adopt a certain value or principle based off your own or the popular ideology.</b> You have to see the country&#39;s ideology, system of governance and so on.
Comment 143.5	@DOUGLAS MAN Subjective? Those are hard facts that you can&#39;t accept or understand, thus labelling them as excuses. And to be brutally honest, you are the only person labelling the people living in China as animals, which in itself , is a big insult. But to be more lenient to you, let me ask , to what degree and extent are the people of China treated as &quot;animals&quot; ? There are over 1.4 billion people living there. Are you insisting they are all living like animals? Being treated like &quot;animals&quot; ? <br /><br />Nice try in trying to antagonize the CCP. But news flash , no government or country or idelogy is perfect.
Comment144	Looking at all the comments from the brainwashed Chinese about Scotland is funny, no comparison whatsoever, at least the haggis munchers can vote on. The government only lets them on YouTube if they&#39;re being paid to comment propaganda.

Comment 146.1	@Bjarke Carlsen our family fled Europe at the beginning of WWII and went to Canada to save their family&#39;s lives. China is going to take over Hong Kong and destroy protestors and any defiant civilians with their 2 million soldiers.
Comment 146.2	That&#39;s not a realistic argument, it has to be your own environment you flee from. xD.. Most people end up far worse when they flee unless circumstances are extreme, these are &#39;just&#39; riots protesting government decisions it&#39;s hardly something you would flee a country over. xD
Comment147	You can brainwashed people with your media, but not me, I saw how this so called peaceful young protesters beat up people who have a different views and opinions than them, vandalizing and destroying their own country.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Brutally assaulting police and then when the police shoot them, they will act like they are the victims while they mauling a one police officer to death!!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ok peeps support the Hong kong protesters for their so called freedom! That they even hurt their own citizens and destroying their own establishments

Comment152	Protect the children? These protesters are not children anymore okay. How about those innocent people who got beaten up by these protesters?

Comment 154.1	@C B this &#39;take away christians from this story&#39; part is where i can&#39;t  figure where i took the christians away. where did i take them?
Comment 154.2	C B <br />Agree! The report isn’t centered around Christianity. It’s just that the organizer himself is a Christian.... who is at this circumstance applying his faith and put into action .. How one apply his faith in real life is ones individuality. No general conclusion, should be drawn to say one way or other about Christianity in general...
Comment 154.3	This isn’t about Christianity. Wake up and look at the reality. This is about the injustice against the youth in Hong Kong and how these braves souls are trying to protect the youngsters. Yes their Christianity is giving them strength to push through this hard time, but if all you can take away from this story is that they are Christians then you need to get your head out of your ass

This is the true picture of the so called peaceful protestors of HK <a href=""https://youtu.be/hnFt3tVHKns"">https://youtu.be/hnFt3tVHKns</a><br /><br />Of all the DESTRUCTION that the “so called peaceful protesters” had done, why are BBC news still continue to  allow Tessa Wong and Grace Taoi to broadcast this mis-information.  You have given BBC news a BAD name, totally disappointed.  It is this type of bad reporting that would mislead your audience and trap them into supporting the demonstrators as in the case of NBA from America.   For the sake of your audience, please tell the TRUTH. <br /><br />If they really wants to protect the children, why are they encouraging them to act this violent way ? Hong Kong allow PEACEFUL protests with no violent. They should be talking to these youngsters and help them conduct themselves in peaceful demonstration and not by blocking roads, destroying the rail systems, destroying public and private protests and beating up people that disagreed with their view. Also making claims of police bully/brutality without sufficient information to allow the police to investigate whether their claim is truthful or not. Making false claims of the police/firefighter/mtr is covering deaths on Aug 31st. <br /><br />If they really wants to protect the children, why are the school teachers/members of the church brainwash these youngsters into believing the HK government is corrupt ?"

Comment 196.1	@dj james arundel None of my 7 children will be transgender or any other perversion because I have raised them properly in a stable happy family with Christian values at the core or our everyday life.  They know the world is evil and will lie to them.<br /><br /><br />People who don&#39;t have a moral backbone or who make the most important thing in their family a soccer team or Netflix or material comfort and material goods are susceptible to the messages of the world, but Christian values properly taught in a stable family will ALWAYS win over the messages of the freemasonic new world order.<br /><br /><br />How do I know?  Because I am one of 9 children myself and have 56 nieces and nephews and NONE of them are perverts.  Not a single one.
Comment 196.2	@Greg Grimer nope were born into a system your kids will be transgender if u let the media have it&#39;s way.  Look else where to blame it&#39;s your generation that let them down with the government&#39;s you voted in all the way back when.

Comment216	the old trick is still working: let the church do the dirty work of slowly destroying a society. it worked in east germany but i am sure it will NOT work in hk, because china is not as weak as the east german gvt. was. sorry, cia-boys, this time it wont work!
Comment217	The instigator sand ringleaders really how to make use of stupid people. Why they don’t block and prevent rioters from beating innocent people and committing vandalism? If they do the rioters will beat the shit out of them. So they protect the rioters and claim to be heroes haha.

Comment220	Unrepentant dirty colonialists of UK/USA are still seeking a chance to exploit China that&#39;s why China needs the one-party system. Those young HKGers don&#39;t know it, fall into the trap that greedy colonialist UK/USA has been set.
Comment 220.1	Make east Asia great again!!!
Comment221	These people portray themselves as angles to protect the young protesters.  In fact, they are not and they put these young kids in an even more dangerous situation. Firstly , they obstruct the police while they are on duty. This is a serious criminal offence in HK and can lead to immediate arrest of themselves as well as those protesters who are within close proximity. Secondly, they send a wrong message to these young people by encouraging them to participate in unlawful activities because they feel they are supported by the public. If they really care about these young people , they should encourage them to have peaceful demonstrations instead of vandalising public facilities, paralysing public transportation and attacking civilians and commercial organisations that simply have a different political stand to theirs .  Peaceful protest is permitted in HK and protected by law ! We do not need theses people to cause even more trouble !
Comment222	Does the pastor understand that if China gets its way with HongKong, them, and all other religious groups will be forcibly disbanded? They won&#39;t even get any social credit score for their work, theyll just get disappeared lol

Comment 222.3	Rguya_.303    You are delusional. Christianity is the fastest-growing religion in China. There are more Christians in China now than in Europe!
Comment 222.4	I think they get that they&#39;re trying to protect these young protestor&#39;s from getting seriously hurt by the police.

Comment226	The best way to protect the kids is to keep them out of this mess. Now many of them are ruining their future in the violent protests and don&#39;t even know a thing about what they&#39;re fighting for or what they want. Go back to school.

Comment231	God is watching
Comment232	Hong Kong is falling, we just need to watch TV to see how they destroy their homeland themselves
Comment233	You bunch of religious idiots are the cause of strict religious regulation in China.
Comment234	It&#39;s pretty disheartening to see good HK citizens protecting protesters/rioters from the police and sharing their selfless reasons for volunteering their time. Meanwhile, these rioters/protesters chant, &quot;HK People&quot; and at the same time destroying the city they claim to come from.
Comment 234.1	Exactly
Comment235	As Hong Kong people, I want to say that they are thugs. They are smashing shops, beating people and raping a 14-year-old girl. They are not protesters.
Comment236	Ok
Comment237	You protect your children, and we are protecting our child——Hong Kong, China.<br /><br />But now, your children want to take away our child.<br />We will not allow it.
Comment 237.1	Bad parents who beat and abuse their children have their children taken away. China is a shitty government who keeps their unfortunate populace uneducated dogs with propaganda.
Comment 237.2	Amricans express their angry about refusing companies got censorship by Chinese State standard... But YouTube are censoring pro china videos and ranking Anti China videos all the time ( proof were present by both Chinese and Us vloggers)  It is ridiculous that Americans like Morey define freedom of speech of another country like China even they are not it&#39;s people. I believe it&#39;s the same that Americans only allow it&#39;s people speaking against it but not other nations ppl right? Not to mention that HONGKONG protesting is now proved by many evidence to be pure terrorist attack( just no massive death but it is still  terrorists in it&#39;s core) Other country&#39;s ordinary people never supported terrorist event in USA... Freedom of speech is two way thing. Just like respect. I spend my time these weekend to post proof and truth of HongKong events just because I can&#39;t stand to let a twisting edition of HongKong event to spread on purpose  but doing nothing as an ordinary culturally Chinese who have been to HongKong for many times...
Comment 237.3	A child can only take so much abuse. You might not know this being a brainwashed sycophant, but most people don&#39;t like the government&#39;s boot on their throat.
Comment238	你保护孩子，孩子在外面打/砸/仍/烧/，谁来保护这些受害者？不要装着一副受害者的样子去看待整个问题，如果换做美国试试，你们的孩子再也不会回到家里了。政府对你们已经是最大限度的容忍了不是吗？好好想想，是体制问题，还是人的道德受到外部势力的蒙蔽。
Comment 238.1	人家只是再利用可用的资源，制造舆论。最终达到自己的目的。在他们眼中，这些孩子只是工具。为什么用这些未成年人呢？利用人们的同情心。
Comment239	Yes! Fuck the evil criminal CCP mafia gangsters and their running mad attack dogs! Instead of giving in to Hongkongers legitimate 5 demands, scary lam and her evil master CCP gangsters are escalating their terrorizing and brutalizing atrocities by issuing more repressive laws! Fight back Hongkong! Long live the Resistance!
Comment 239.1	Some of the five demands are absolutely stupid. The rioters shouldn&#39;t be prosecuted for all the damage and destruction they have made. Disgusting lot should be strung up.
Comment240	A bunch of faked Christians.....getting free Transit passes (may be money) to do the work of western powers.....and to disrupt Hong Kong !!
Comment241	Chief Carrie lam became Hitler want policemen will kill young teenager and young protest more die in HK !
Comment 241.1	Rioters should be grateful for the tenderness and hesitation of Carrie Lam. If Carrie Lam steps down, her successor will only be more intolerable to these terrorists. Around 100 rioters would have already be shot down if it wasn’t Carrie Lam being so restrained.
Comment 241.2	Interesting fact: no one have been killed in the protests through months.
Comment 241.3	Are you an idiot or something?
Comment242	You are helping your kids to destroy your city. What a good education. Pleased keep doing this. The whole world is like watching a joke. Lets see who will undertake the results.
Comment243	No more street violence! No more NBA! Protect our children. Protect our life style. We are Chinese forever.
Comment 243.1	@MrJonas0319 Speech is allright, whereas violence is bad. They have became violent riots who destroied public facilities and attacked street civilians. They are spoiled children.
Comment 243.2	@金老師 they just wants to be free and have the right to free speach. They don&#39;t seem to be very happy that they&#39;re voice is not being heard. A bill was passed that the public did not vote for and did not want.<br />Democracy &gt;Chinese lifestyle
Comment 243.3	@MrJonas0319 Hong Kong belong to China for good. Every HK citizens should proud of that, and protect Chinese life style.
Comment 243.4	People don&#39;t want to stand by while China is conquering hong kong. They need to make the world see what China is doing, before it is to late
Comment244	I couldn&#39;t help doubting the motivation of those &quot;God&#39;s saviors&quot;. Are they really trying to save people, or rather they are trying to make the situation worse? The reason that we&#39;ve seen so much brutality is that these so-called protestors are becoming insane recently, damaging social facilities, hurting innocent civilians, journalists, police officers; in order to prevent violence from escalating, cops have to do something, including sometimes resorting to weapons. And here we are, protestors attack social facilities, cops come, protestors fight against cops, cops fight back...<br />    Listen, hate is the root of all these insanities, and that comes from the protestors&#39; side. Why haven&#39;t these &quot;guardians&quot; tried to work out some way to relieve the social unrests but instead chose to protect those mad protesters who are literally hurting other hkers in the name of  “protecting the young&quot;? God will save a person no matter how much evil he has done only because he is young? NO, evil is evil, and he must pay for this. The protection of evil will only incur greater evil. Today you protect those young sinister &quot;protestors&quot; from the police, the other day they will do more damage to the innocent people and this beautiful city, and more young naive teenagers will be driven by this madness and follow the suit, resulting in more conflict between protestors and the police. That&#39;s what you want to see, huh, &quot;preacher&quot;? Your kindness only has saved your own damn consciousness but damaged the whole situation. Oh, wait a minute, is that your true intention? <br />    God aint gonna save hk, cuz Chinese are fxking atheists. They will save themselves out. And before that day come, BBC, plz shut your mouth and watch.
Comment245	&quot;There r dozen of discussion groups on FB that are pro rioters. Their posts r extremely biased - blame everything on the government, the police, and the Chinese government. But whatever they do themselves - protests, riots, internet bullying, violence etc., are always righteous and justified. It&#39;s a villain playing victim scenario, be independent and careful of what they r saying when they r begging ur support.
Comment246	What a group of liars... You said you being mediator to both side is a lie to cover youself... What i seen from the live streaming is you pamper those youngster to throw bricks and  molotov petrol over the police and immediately stand in front of the children when the police doing the arrestment... You allowed the rioters to hit those ordinary people who have different point of views... What mediator are you.. I don&#39;t get it... So i ain&#39;t supporting you... You are the one should be arrested... AN EVIL using  the name of GOD ... As a Christian!!! What a shame...<br />GOD SHOULD PUNISHED THOSE PEOPLE LIKE YOU...
Comment247	宜家都唔係保護，而係縱容，唔想講咩…
Comment248	Protesters are not natural...ready made t shirts, stickers.  FAKE
Comment 248.1	Oh lord they printed T-SHIRTS and STICKERS! God knows that only the CIA only make clothings worth &lt;$5!! (sarcasm intended)
Comment 248.2	@Raquya_.303 n money.
Comment 248.3	You know how easy it is to make that stuff? lol
Comment249	The BBC has yet to show one news article that shows the rioters/looters/muggers in a bad light! I think its because they employ a few &quot;Yellow Shirts&quot; in Hong Kong. There have been over 2000 ticketing machines smashed, Mobile phone shops smashed and looted, Fingers of police bitten off, Laser pointers attempting to blind police. Worst of all hundreds of innocent bystanders attacked by the mob for complaining that they are destroying things, even for speaking Mandarin in the street! Such a terror campaign can have no legitimacy were it not for the support of media corporations such as the BBC that portray it as all of Hong Kong people against Beijing. There are two sides in Hong Kong, those in favour of the riots, and the majority which are against.
Comment 249.1	@Bob Grout Excellent, play them at their own game!  Lets get personal Tessa Wong does strange things with bunny rabbits ;-)
Comment 249.2	@Sister C I have passed by the police thousands of times and I have never ever once been attacked by a HK police officer!  QED
Comment 249.3	Well, I passed by the rallies many times and not once did I see or nor I was attacked by the protestors.
Comment 249.4	This was probably by Tessa Wong or one of her terrorist sympathiser friends at BBC HK!
Comment 249.5	@章奇 You are right, but I trusted the BBC for 50 years! I am so shocked at what I can only call &quot;Propaganda&quot;!
Comment250	I wish I could be sympathetic to them, but I can&#39;t get rid of my mind that they may just be &quot;syrian white helmet&quot; act of HongKong trying to depict law enforcers as evil people...
Comment 250.1	You are right
Comment251	yes,protecting kids,killing police,how kind you are!
Comment252	so, they protect protesters at all cost, but not police who got beat up or innocent civilians that beat up and happen to disagree with protesters, or don&#39;t stop protesters to destroy public facilities which would make lots of people suffer? bring religiion too? that&#39;s why religion has no place in civilised world.
Comment253	what a shame BBC ，you post fake news，and get benifit from policy
Comment254	5 demands: deception, violation, devastation, humiliation &amp; disinformation. No one less.<br />HK gov&#39;t should enact more related laws through the Emergency Regulation Ordinance to get HK back on track.
Comment255	Arrest those fools , they are obstructing law enforcement ! Religious Nutters .
Comment256	Chinese troll bots approaching
Comment 256.1	@KC T Rubbish, how many communists in the police force? Perhaps a few only! They are just trying to protect people and property against the rioters. If there were no riots there would be no need for riot police. Without the support of media corporations such as the BBC the cockroaches would be nothing in HK
Comment 256.2	Wayne Beckett  HK police already under the command of communist china, they have done evil and lose out the trust to HK people
Comment 256.3	@KC T hahaha that&#39;s hilarious. Do you think everyone with a holster is police. Because that&#39;s not the case in the USA or anywhere else in the world. Also the images I have seen are not police issue weapons. Most likely they are replica pistols that are easily available in HK. You and many others have been fooled by these people again and again
Comment 256.4	Wayne Beckett   photos taken by reporters on the scene, showing police disguised as protesters hurling petro bombs with handgun on his belt !
Comment 256.5	@KC T hahahaahaha... Thats funny!  Of course you have proof of this
Comment257	Ask your coward children to take off their masks first.<br />And the point is, what we saw more is police get beaten up by the protestors, why don&#39;t you protect the police instead, bunch of jokes.
Comment 257.1	@FeoniX I&#39;ve seen footage of the police beating people on the ground, who posed no threat. Now, I&#39;m sure there are protesters who are going too far and inciting violence, but it seems to me that the majority are peaceful and only retaliate when they are provoked with tear gas, gunshots, etc.<br /><br />However, I&#39;m from not from China, so as an outsider I welcome any comments from Hong Kong locals as to what is really going on.
Comment 257.2	@Anonymous User But you can see that the protesteors are throwing bricks and waving sticks, while the police do not use their gears unless their life is threatened.
Comment 257.3	Not sure if you noticed, but the police have full riot gear, weaponry and the support of the government. They don&#39;t need protecting.
Comment258	守护孩子你干嘛要去大街上？孩子好好的在学校里，在校车里，在家里。它们为什么需要你的守护？视频中也没有警察迫害儿童的证据。
Comment259	police does its job. They arrested some rioter. Better google Los Angeles 1992. HK police is too weak, to tolerant, no such police in EU or USA.
Comment260	You are protecting those who are destroying their own city, and you tell me you are doing the right thing.
Comment261	shame on BBC！
Comment262	The eyes of Hong Kong people are now open. Communism is evil, Democracy is good!
Comment263	你保护“孩子”，他们的“行为”正确？你应该在家里保护他们；谁来保护香港稳定，谁来制止打、砸、烧、抢……SB动机不纯。

Comment 263.2	这些人分明颠倒是非，害了这些年轻人一生的正是这些邪恶的伪教徒，没有一个宗教是教人忤逆父母、欺负老弱妇幼、打砸烧抢、暴动违法的！Come on, this is clearly FAKE NEWS!!!

Comment264	Motherfukeres honkongers🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Comment 264.1	Yo mama
Comment265	Sound&#39;s great, but why just protect the young rioters?  In many cases, these young rioters were trying to kill the polices with petro - bombs and bricks.  I think the polices need protection more than the young rioters.   Are you protecting the young rioters so that they can commit crimes without bring arrested by the polices?   Bad ideas and bad witness for God.
Comment266	香港加油!!!!! <br /><br />希望我們經歷無數次的民主化運動和對抗獨裁的示威,能夠獨立於現在同樣經歷的香港市民。
Comment267	1. Hong Kong is part of China.<br />2. Hong Kong must raises Chinese National flag and Hong Kong regional flag together.<br />3. Hong Kong Chief Executive must not be a foreigner while almost all judges are foreigners.<br />4. Who cares about your f freedom while your textbooks are brainwashing children with anti-china knowledge?<br />5. You blame all the bad things on China&#39;s conspiracy while using chinese electricity , water and food. You boycott everything done by China including the construction of the bridges, high-speed rail for you and leads to $10 billions over budget.<br />6. You turn on all the lights and air conditioners to talk about environmental protection while 80 percent of electricity  produced by Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Shenzhen being transported to Hong Kong.<br />7. You democraZy protesters refuse the extradition bill which is proposed by your Chinese chief executive. These pissful protesters will feel happy if the extradition bill was enforced by your British Governor before 1997. <br />8. You&#39;d be more realistic by asking your Western masters to attack China than pursuing Hong Kong&#39;s independence which is under the mask of Free Hong Kong.<br />9. Some people say that Hong Kong people should choose their own chief executive. What about Lai Chee-Ying who is the top leader of the protesters? He was publicly said that they are fighting for the US against China In Washington.<br />10. In fact, there is no evidence that Hong Kong belongs to China except point 2 and point 3. Can you imagine that you can only get a seven-day pass for traveling in your own country?
Comment268	Those so called pro-democracy protesters, in fact they’re rioters.  They said They were paid by foreign force to conduct those violence and spreading lies around. Hong Kong people and government named them opposition group, as in fact they were pursuing dictatorship rather than democracy, and beating up innocent people become their norm.  Hong Kong people look at them in disgust and call them Cockroaches.  I think it is kind of another form of Falun Gong.
Comment269	"just report some good news about miscreants of GRETA THUNBERG ,look  what they have done to the EU,it can make me laugh for days"
Comment270	"just report some good news about miscreants of GRETA THUNBERG ,look  what they have done to the EU,it can make me laugh for days"
Comment271	Also think of what you would see if you visited China and Hong Kong 40 years ago. Very very different. If you visited China and Hong Kong any time in the past 20 years? They look very much the same. Does Hong Kong look like China or does China look like Hong Kong?  Who is changing who? Hong Kong won, is still winning, and Hong Kong is still helping China by its example. Don&#39;t lose hope, repression is always a dead end.<br />   I hope I’m not too much of a busy body. The protesters are very smart, if any of what I’ve written is helpful, all I’ve done is what you’ve already figured out or soon will. <br />   Political demands are more powerful when those making them are prepared to take responsibility. What can the protest movement do for others in Hong Kong that isn’t being done? When the TV news only shows them a guy with a hammer in the MTR; make sure they’ve been introduced to Hong Kong’s future so they will immediately think of the protesters they know who wouldn’t do that, people who wouldn’t tear gas, pepper spray or beat someone just because they disagree. Stand with Hong Kong — right now they are standing up for all of us.
Comment272	How about educating them?
Comment273	"This is what God is witnessing.<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/tc4LbB7Mi-k"">https://youtu.be/tc4LbB7Mi-k</a>"

Comment275	会反噬的傻屌BBC,你们往香港输出革命，很快英国人就会有样学样，彻底变成小不列颠，蠢货。你们要是不让英国人烧地铁，堵机场，砸议院，他们会质疑自己的民主自由的，你们社会价值观就崩塌了。
Comment276	This is shame using religion to support violence. you use teenagers to get your interest.
Comment277	Using kids, shame on your protesters.
Comment278	BBC is lying here again to report that this Christian group is there to prevent violence from erupting. The fact is they are there to protect the young protestors against the police. Once they commit violence and are pursued by the police, these so-called Christians are there to help them escape. The usual strategy is to form a human barricade to obstruct the police from carrying out their duty.
Comment279	To protect the kids, you should tell them to stop the violence and go back home. God will not bless you if you choose to destroy your city.
Comment 279.1	I smell a communist
Comment280	Jesus ask u to pray...not to involve in politic
Comment 280.1	Exactly
Comment281	When religion became part of politic gamee....
Comment282	Seriously, if these just protest peacefully no one NO ONE would hurt them. Once they start using molatov cocktail, bomb, brick pipe or whatever they can find to vandalized yhe city, police has full right to arrest them. They break the law by destroying public property.  You should be ashamed of yourself for not teaching them to reapect other.

Comment290	I don&#39;t know what to say? are you bearing good witness for God in front of the policemen? To protect children&#39;s life, instead, you might as well persuade them not to participate in these violent scenes,  and to read more of God&#39;s words so as to be wise not to be used by politicians as weapons, or to study hard and work hard to use your talent to serve the needy. There are so much more meaningful and less ambivalent things to do!
Comment 290.1	Totally agree! This pastor is trying to be gd in the wrong way!!! As if protester in disguise
Comment291	they are protecting the &quot;kids&quot; while the &quot;kids&quot; are destroy everything, then it&#39;s a evil deed.
Comment292	Why bbc doesn’t report news of a video of how a group of people in black tees(protestors) attacked the officer?<br /><br />Why bbc only show how cops beat the protestors?<br /><br />Hong Kong is part of China. You can’t say you guys are not chinese.  Your ancestors are chinese.
Comment293	ermm...The KID they protect are beating civilians, smashing subway stations, throwing incendiary bombs...
Comment294	God please help them to win. If they miss this chance they would not have next till minimum next century. Don&#39;t be scared. We know that there&#39;s gonna be some bloods but it will make your homeland much better, it will save your nation. Think about your next generations and fight for them and win!!!!
Comment 294.1	@Hoon I traveled all over the world, not like you, the network mob.
Comment 294.2	@王文 lol am I? You are just a poor Chinese who doesn&#39;t even know the truth because your country suppresses the press. Do you even know that there is so many evidences that their police made this situation worse, not them. And can you even understand why are they fighting for their rights? I said there&#39;s gonna be some bloods but that doesn&#39;t mean I encourage the violence lol. There is always some sacrifices sadly when people trying to reform there nation and to get their rights as a human. But they have to and also want to do it for them and their homeland.
Comment 294.3	Well, I just found out you&#39;re Korean guy.<br />It seams that some Korean people hate Chinese people so much.
Comment 294.4	Hiding on the Internet, incitement bleed and violence, you are a squalid person, shame on your family and homeland.
Comment295	they are not kids.... they are rioters!!!
Comment 295.1	@Renso Daniel Del Castillo Vega Furthermore, why do the kids need &quot;protection&quot;???  they are the ones who are throwing petrol bombs, creating road blocks, destroying properties first then the cops have no choice but to show up and try to disperse them ....  I say we need to protect the cops!!!
Comment 295.2	@Renso Daniel Del Castillo Vega So what, if a kid murders, we&#39;ll try them as adults in U.S.  Try rioting in U.S., you&#39;ll be taking down by cops without mercy, unlike Hong Kong cops.  Cops will shoot here the moment you move your hands.

Comment 299.2	This &#39;save the children group&#39; is rebirth of the Waco evil cult group. They are sending 12 years old to the frontline as cannon fodders so their fake press could make a sensational headline news.

Comment301	Kids wouldnt need to be protected if they abide the law. Unfortunately they are throwing petrol bombs, beating up police and civilians who impede their actions, smashing mtr stations. They should not be ”protected” for taking responsibility for their actions.  Nobody is above the law and underaged criminals also have to face trial.
Comment302	Gullible BBC again. Easily led with a deliberately confusing named group. Secret recording showed, the pastor in the name of Gob blessed a gas mask and body kit before handing over to protesters.&#39; God will protect you if you put this kit on &#39;. If this group has any moral compass, they should use their time and effort telling kids to stay home instead of telling kids going to the frontline as cannon fodders. This is no Christain group, just an evil cult like Waco.

Comment 312.1	you are right!!
Comment313	They never show the negataice side of these protesters actions towards innocent people yet they call themselves media. They should be ashamed.
Comment314	This is what the HK Govt and MoonGoose should learn about us, the righteous protesters. <br />&gt;We have the most correct idealism of how HK&#39;s future should be. <br />&gt;We destroy because we want to rebuild a better HK. <br />&gt;We want HK to become a war zone because then UN or US will come to rescue.  <br />&gt;We  do not recognize ourselves as Chinese because then we can apply political asylum or be accepted as refugee by other countries. <br />&gt;We don&#39;t want to embrace China because China is only number 2 super power; US is the real number 1.<br />&gt;We don&#39;t need China or come into work inside China for the reason China do not speak our language (80% Cantonese and 20% English)  <br />&gt;We are not afraid of being jailed because then we can put the jail time as part of our resume in the future HK.  <br />For those who support the above allegations, please add in more about what Goose should know more about you.
Comment 314.1	Well, you said &#39;We destroy because we want to rebuild a better HK&#39;. <br />That sound very interesting, because your word is just sounds like the reason of terrorist.<br />So that&#39;s the reason you young guys are attacking innocent people, destroying the public buildings,  holding up and inspecting the normally running vehicle, strong crossing citizen&#39;s home and painted at the gate.<br />Give the meanest deeds the noblest reason. <br />If the  HongKong young mobs are the representation of freedom and democracy, I will say the western value is just a joke.
Comment315	Please help Kurds&#39;s kids fake GOD
Comment316	Fake News, why don&#39;t you show the mob youngsters beating a senior citizen with a hammer? Why don&#39;t you show they break the head of a famous actress who just took a photo of the rioters vandalizing public porperties? Go check HK metro stations before you praise these so called kids. They are problematic kids!
Comment317	"<a href=""https://youtu.be/EMVpwjkuHI0"">https://youtu.be/EMVpwjkuHI0</a><br />Lol, these mobs kids did not meet Hitler&#39;s expectations. He is mad."
Comment318	Its ridiculous how biased media has been when reporting in Hong Kong. Biased news vs biased news. Embarrassing. Media will be   the most dangerous weapon in the 21st century.
Comment319	You really need to stop using jesus christ name to protect the sinners. Jusus loves everyone and everyone must love jesus and stop throwing bricks and gas bomb to another.
Comment 319.1	Jesus loves sinners. Jesus died for the sinners. He knows no difference and loves all. <br />if you truly believed in jesus, you would learn to love too.
Comment 319.2	Exactly
Comment320	Heavenly Father protect Hong Kong protests and your nation in Jesus name I pray. Amen.

Comment 320.2	Heavenly protect HK from foreign meddling, fake press, fake religious group, lies intimidation and violence against the police. Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. End this save the children cult, no repeat of Waco.
Comment321	WHY bbc doing this to themselfves....
Comment322	This is very unfair. These volunteers do not understand that because of the actions that these rogue young protesters are taking, the police will want to keep themselves safe. The members of the police force also want to go home to their families and see their children. If these protestors had kept the protests peaceful and cooperated with the Hong Kong government, police brutality (not that it isn&#39;t justified, even if it does happen) wouldn&#39;t be a thing.
Comment323	NO. THIS IS ILLEGAL. BLOCKING POLICE WAY. SUPPORT HK AND ITS POLICE
Comment324	Only China can stop itself.
Comment325	Good work guys.<br />Down with HK police.<br />China doesnt spare anyone. One they this police will be stamped as well by China.

Comment 335.3	@albert guosg Beijing will not directly interfere giving the current circumstance with all the west media hoping to see blood. None of the west countries will dare directly interfere. So people of Hong Kong are the only key to end this.

Comment339	Your intentions are good, but if you really want to protect the children, why don&#39;t you ask them to stop the riots. Do you think what the children rioters doing is good? Destroying the city and beating up people who don&#39;t agree with them.
Comment340	You protect kids (in fact, they are not kids anymore,they are destroyers), who protect the peace of Hongkong, it&#39;s police. you are not God, you cannot do God&#39;s thing, DO NOT say these word so pure.

Comment342	You cannot tell me that China is just in their actions.

Meanwhile UN and worldbank data also contradict what u keep telling me. Mmmmm..i wonder what s wrong with me.
Comment 342.4	why dont the christian protect those in the right side of the law, the policemen.. . Christianity is no difference from other religion  like islam. Using the name of God to create trouble. These people are no difference from the protesters as their brain have been badly washed
Comment 342.5	@C G E You are insane. India belongs to the Indian people which has longer civilizations than the British. HKongers and Mainland Chinese are of the same race and of the same civilizations dating back 5,000 years ago.

Comment344	this church hv to close.please don use god name. you hv demon heart.
Comment345	La violencia física, entre otras formas de violencia, contra los movimientos sociales, siempre será fallida. Sin embargo, en el caso de Hong Kong, dos sistemas económicos y políticos bajo la misma soberanía china deben ser parte de las negociaciones entre civiles y autoridades, siempre cuidando las formas de no violencia. No hay otra forma de lograr la paz. Si hay personas infiltradas en las protestas &quot;sociales&quot;, que sueñan con regresar al colonialismo, incluso portando deseos y banderas del Reino Unido y los Estados Unidos, pueden solicitar asilo en esos países y declararse no chinos. Si las protestas siguen la misma forma de suspirar por el colonialismo, peor, mucho peor. China continental debería ser un país libre. No al colonialismo tardío, no violencia en todas sus formas.
Comment346	Physical violence, among other forms of violence, against societal movements, will always be failed. However, in the case of Hong Kong, two economic and political systems under the same Chinese sovereignty must be part of negotiations between civilians and authorities, always taking care of non-violence forms. There is no other way to achieve peace. If there are individuals infiltrated in the &quot;social&quot; protests, who dream of returning to colonialism, including carrying wishes and flags of the United Kingdom and the United States, they can request asylum in those countries, and declare themselves non-Chinese. If the protests follow the same way of sighing for colonialism, worse, much worse. Mainland China should be a free country. No to late colonialism, no violence in all its forms.
Comment347	Y HK ppl want HK in a mess? Free from China and destroy the peace of the city can&#39;t help at all lol. Now everyone in the world knows HK isn&#39;t safe anymore and no one will do business or travel there. If HK really free from China than it lose it&#39;s value and become useless 2 the US maybe.

Comment352	Protect them? NO! Young protesters shouldn&#39;t be on the streets in the first place - you should have critical thinking, see the whole picture, and have a solid understanding of what you believe in for you to protest, not just brainwashed by some fanatic propaganda. Plus, it&#39;s dangerous.
Comment 352.1	It&#39;s normal for students to protests. Examples: Prague Spring (&#39;68), Tiananmen (&#39;89), civil rights and anti Vietnam war movement (&#39;70s), etc.

Comment 355.1	You prove yourself to be a vile moron.<br /><br /><br />Hope your parents try to post-abort you.
Comment356	"&quot;With regard to the ongoing political crisis in Hong Kong, it is quite clear that the Chinese approach to the protests is not to do another Tiananmen and send in the tanks but rather to allow them to hold more demonstrations despite occasional violent episodes so that public opinion would turn against them. China&#39;s approach seems to be to isolate the hardliners and win back the population, especially the young people. Basically, it is to give them enough rope to hang themselves.  This is a challenge to the policy of &quot;one country, two systems,&quot; and this also applies to the case of Taiwan, which China considers a province.&quot; <a href=""http://manilastandard.net/opinion/columns/about-town-by-ernesto-m-hilario/3071"">http://manilastandard.net/opinion/columns/about-town-by-ernesto-m-hilario/3071</a>   09/conversation-with-our-man-in-beijing.html"

Comment 356.2	Good strategy! I personally I am for it. Let it be let it be.  But I am also worried the wellbeing of the vast  law-abiding citizens in Hong Kong. How their lives have been affected by the continuous violence? I think the Chinese goverment instead needs to do something to protect them and recover social order. Or HongKong will soon die to be a mediocre little town, indeed very soon.....

I am not going to persuade you but give you a little advice.<br />If you want to be wise, please absorb the information from different political stand medias.<br />Because in the era of big data, even in the same website, people of different political positions can only access to the information they are interested in, please don&#39;t make yourself ignorant and parochial.
Comment358	Resisting office, protecting violence and indulging violence.  The fool will think that you are guarding the child, and your behavior is to harm the child.  And they are not children, they are the same age people as you.
Comment359	Stop destroying our own city. China is not going to just give up and leave Hong Kong
Comment360	It is time for Hongkong Police to take stern and deterrent action. Prepare to use firearm readily as soon as rioters starting to attack with weapons. <br />Shooting with firearms at many instances are legal and justifiable.<br />Killing one or two will make cockroaches run for their lives.<br />Killing a few more will straight away quench unlawful assembly and rioting.<br />Be firm.  You will see result straight away.
Comment 360.1	Yep, that sounds about right from a commie chee-na slave bot

Comment 362.1	They are clowns.....all kinds of protesters in disguise
Comment363	Best for them to do is to keep their children at home.<br />Don&#39;t let their children to become rioters and criminals.<br />Criminals need to pay for crime they have committed, facing arrest, going to jail, risk injury to extend being killed.....as they want to be dead heroes!

Comment 367.1	@chf gbp if you don&#39;t live in China don&#39;t comment about it like you know what&#39;s going on inside the state. China is rich, not Chinese people. And 90% of national wealth are controlled by powerful communist families. Get your facts right. They legit control different fields of economy. One family controls network, another controls oil industry, another controls steel industry and this goes on and on. And we all know what and who those families are, but we can&#39;t do anything, because they control the judge, the army and the cops as well.

Comment 367.4	@nima cao  Really? The oft quoted social issues in HK are wealth inequality, outdated education and healthcare resources, and uncontrolled capitalism due to too little government intervention. So these social issues do not exist in democratic countries? Can you please name a country with faster improving living standards than China in the past four decades?

I respect every one who has his or her own religion or belief, but I don&#39;t agree with what they are doing under today&#39;s circumstances. The truth is we should protect those kids, but not in this way please. The new HongKong&#39;s generation has been ruined, well, not by Chinese Government, but by Hong Kong citizens themselves. Demagogues are using those kids as their scapegoats and sowing the violent seeds in their heart core. Seriously speaking, those seeds are already sprouting. The only way to stop it is to keep them away from protests, instead of supporting them yelling and mobbing on the street by so-called &quot;defense&quot;. THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO PROTECT KIDS!  It can only make the situation worse and make those kids think what they are doing is right and for whatever mistakes they made, they don&#39;t need to take any responsibility."

Hong Kong&#39;s democracy and freedoms they were guaranteed have already been greatly eroded. <br />&gt;a taiwan man killed his pregnant girlfriend and put her body in a suitcase, flew to hk to avoid justice&#39;s punishment, and started all these things, if that&#39;s what you call basic rights<br />Based on that comment, it&#39;s safe to say it&#39;s you who has no idea about the situation in HK. This isn&#39;t about the murder, it&#39;s about the bill that would allow the government to extradite people to the mainland, where they do not have a fair and just judicial system, and would in all likelihood be exploited by the chinese government to imprison hong kongers who criticize them. Hell, this already happened with the causeway books disappearances. Look it up.
Comment 378.4	​@MrIndigoninja this is how these kind of chat always end. Why would i even waste time explaining in the first place. I for one hate the censorship and never defended it and I only talk about facts. the ccp fought back the U.S. in the korean war, and even invaded vietnam for some other reasons, they fear nothing. there are a lot of reasons they didnt take over hong kong, stability, business, reputation, plans for taiwan, etc, but they are the ones who respect the agreement at lease on the surface, and hkers are the ones refusing to take the bitter &#39;1 country 2 systems&#39; pill. the roit has been going on for months and ccp&#39;s army in hk has not moved a single bit. all u seeing now is hk people overthrowing other hk ppl. you think you care about hk? from you comments you don&#39;t know anything about the situation or the city. ppl fighting for their basic rights? a taiwan man killed his pregnant girlfriend and put her body in a suitcase, flew to hk to avoid justice&#39;s punishment, and started all these things, if that&#39;s what you call basic rights, well then fk me why wasting more time

Comment384	The people of Hong Kong were born free and sold into communist China as slaves.  Why is the free world not horrified over this? If this can happen to us here in Hong Kong, it can happen to any free people anywhere in the world.
Comment 384.1	@su yong Tong Thanks for sharing!
Comment 384.2	@Francis Chan <br />Wow ? ? ? such needless vitriol ? ? ? <br />Your attitude alone exposes your true colours! <br />Your actions are counterproductive to our world today and are not accepted by the global society at large.<br />Your name would suggest we are the same people? <br />So why the hatred? <br />I&#39;ve not spoken disrespectfully in anyway towards anyone? So why suggest I should leave my home? We are Hong Kong people. <br />We were born as free men. <br />We are not slaves to any tyrannical political system that is determined to control us, measure us, to reeducate us or own us like cattle. This is the core issue. Hong Kong people were born into freedom under the British Monarchy from 1849 until 1997. Under the peace treaty by and between the China Monarch and British Monarch the inhabitants of the Hong Kong region are Hong Kong people, loyal subjects to their Sovereign Monarch. This fact is an important legal precedence that is relative even today. Hong Kong, by legal precedence has legal claim to declare their independence as a city state.

Comment388	Who protect the children who disagree with the protesters?
Comment 388.1	First of all the ones who disagree are not under attack on the same level as the children who disagree with the government and second the government protects them or at least should protesct them and if it is not capable of that it has no right to continue to exist.

Comment394	Anyone in U.K. who watches live TV broadcasts on TV or radio or watched or receives any BBC TV or radio by laws has to pay for the BBC TV license.  Now if you don’t pay the BBC TV license you can be fined or go to prison .  Many people are confused and believed just because they have a TV in their house assume they have to pay the BBC TV license and they do not wish to face prison or heavy fines if they don’t so they pay it. Now it may be possible that they didn’t need to pay for the license. If you look at the rules they are often vague and intimidating should the fee not be paid. The government have a BBC charter in place allowing these laws to exist and be enforced.  The BBC is absolutely not allowed to be biased and if there is a bias complaints have to be filed via two concurrent methods via the BBC complaints service and failing the outcome of this the third line of appeal is through OFCOM . It really is very beurocratic and long winded .   There is no freedom of choice and there is unfortunately plenty of bias.  It is long winded and complex deliberately in order to maintain the current level of subscriptions to the BBC TV license which collects many billions of pounds per year.  In summary the government allows laws to exist which are unfair.

Comment 398.1	They aren&#39;t going to sit down while their people slowly lose all autonomy to the CCP, it&#39;s not like HK would make a referendum asking &#39;Do you agree with our new extradition law&#39; so it seems the protests have stemmed from a clash between the CCP system of rule and the democratic model they currently have,  this is only going to get worse over the next 20 years

Comment 399.4	"@Roma AS Since when unbiased media became a luxury in our daily life. And yes there are many unbiased media regarding china such as <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lianhe_Zaobao"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lianhe_Zaobao</a><br />It covers both negative and possitive news in Asia. And you know what the most sacarstic thing is? China does have a legal unbiased media. It is called reference news. <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_News"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_News</a><br />The paper covers whatever the western media says but with NO commentary. A few decades ago, only party member can subscribe them. After deng&#39;s reform, now all chinese are now able to access these news.<br /><br />So while CNN and BBC are saying shit like these, you can understand why  many chinese are triggered. Many westerners are living in the dreams that the chinese are bots and kept unimformed. And once the chinese get informed they will overthrow their gov immediately. This is simply an illusion."
Comment 399.5	this is s group of people in the middle who protects both sides did you not see the part with the pro police person being beat
Comment400	The ppl with these vests basically confuse the fuck out of cops cuz the news reporters also wear the vests....just the roll the military in China
Comment401	These so-called children are beating up police and ordinary citizens, including Christians. They ought to be &quot;Stop the Violence&quot; volunteers.
Comment 401.1	The population of Hong Kong is over 7 million. There are far more who do not support the violence. The majority being silent and accommodating to the youths should not be presented in the media as backing the protestors.
Comment 401.2	Evidence is for the courts. Hong Kong Rule of Law is one of its cornerstones. The current legal framework is based on English common law, which has served Hong Kong well both and after 1997. The judiciary can independently challenge the executive or legislative action. It still ranks amongst the highest in the world, even above that of good ol’ USA. If so, the society should respect and therefore, adhere to the Rule of Law. Dispute should be argued in the courts and not on the streets. <br /><br />Otherwise, it is pure anarchy or Law of the Jungle which is what the protestors or rioters appeared to be advocating by their actions. The end does not justify the means. If it does, both sides can sing to the same tune. Rioters who carry out violent acts (and their supporters) should not be whining when the authority responds in kind.<br /><br />&quot;Stop the Violence&quot; on both sides.
Comment 401.3	It is not possible for the police to know the age or gender of the person being shot since the rioter was fully masked. The current &quot;no-mask&quot; law might lessen the likelihood of such shooting in the future. The police would probably think twice before taking extreme measure when confronted by underage rioters who are not masked.<br /><br />Hong Kong has been peaceful and orderly before these thugs showed up. It would help to return Hong Kong back to normality if these rioters as well as the authority could de-escalate their actions. It would also help if the media is less biased in their coverage. They should covering the news and not making it.
Comment 401.4	Ok the children are beating up the police and citizens. Why not shoot your children with a machine gun? Problems solved??
Comment402	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjGKt4EYjQ&amp;t=3m20s"">3:20</a>! So they couldn&#39;t do anything when protester mobs beat up people who disagree with them? Because they are so many, so they couldn&#39;t do anything! But with police it&#39;s a different story, and they suppose to be neutral?"
Comment 402.1	The police is less violent than protesters.
Comment 402.2	Nah their job is to get the rioters shit escape, not others
Comment 402.3	Yes, theyre just trying to maintain calm for both sides. Nothing u can do. Some protesters beat China supporters and some police beat protesters. Its escalated to that point.
Comment403	JESUS CHRIST = FAKE NEWS. A figurehead fabricated by the Romans to subdue and control the masses.

Comment410	Who they are protecting? They are protecting those who beat other people (including old people) and they think this as &quot;Justice&quot;
Comment 410.1	Of course its unjust for police to be beating people like this<br />Those police deserve to be headshot
Comment411	As a Chinese, I think you should go and see what is really happening in Hong Kong, China is not a country totally controlled by the government, we accept other ideology unless it violates our own country. No confirmation bias. Please!!!

Comment416	I have to say the BBC used to be favourite media, I&#39;ve listened FNC for years and even knew Jeramy Hardy passed away earlier this year. So its really upset to see BBC stand at the opposite and ignore so many alarming facts behind. After all, it&#39;s the media for another nation, not the whole world
Comment417	we lived the same thing in turkey. people died. nothing changed.
Comment 417.1	i did not say turkey is like china. this protests are look like &quot;gezi protests&quot; if you are old enough to remember that... people wearing gas masks. most of them underage or very young. and older adults are trying to protect them. police using excessive force. all looks familiar.
Comment 417.2	@Efe Aslan they had a similar situation a couple of years ago when the military tried to overthrow the government.
Comment 417.3	You&#39;re talking rubbish turkey is nothing like China
Comment418	Good made him do it.
Comment419	Sorry for going too emotional. I agree that kids shall be protected. After all, they are hope. But it&#39;s really annoying to see BBC is sort of praising the kids. I don&#39;t want more kids to go on the street to throw bombs. It&#39;s not the work they should have done since most kids lack of judgement and experience. I wish they could just grow more powerful and knowledgeable, then we can play.
Comment 419.1	@Lau Z But still, don&#39;t put too many pictures on your phone if you want to come to Shenzhen. Sometimes, I&#39;ll feel kind of split out when I back to Shenzhen, it&#39;s basically very very and very tranquil.
Comment 419.2	@Lau Z Well, my boyfriend and some of my colleagues have met that situation. My boyfriend thinks that&#39;s stupid, coz it&#39;s really time-consuming and won&#39;t help to solve the problem. My colleague felt that&#39;s ok...... Now I think they check less. For me and my mainland friends, I never heard someone&#39;s been checked.
Comment 419.3	@Panda Liu :)) no worries. I guess you&#39;re the young group of people too. Do they like do heavy checkups on u at the boarder when u cross HK nowadays?
Comment 419.4	@Lau Z I didn&#39;t catch the news for recent days, I am busy like a bee in Shenzhen. Nice to chat with you too.
Comment 419.5	@Panda Liu Tbh, I really don&#39;t think he has mental illness, it was just some excuse that he can use to get away.But yea take care to you too. You&#39;re one of the nicer mainlanders that I chatted with on the YouTube haha:)
Comment420	oh wow carrying on the great tradition and doing dirty work in god&#39;s name like the crusaders,  and helping nazi escape to south america after war. why don&#39;t you protect the defenseless civilians whose shops these guys trash, kids cant get home because these terrorist blocked airports damaged public transport, people cant go to work cause they burn their shops. protecting criminals is the same as committing crime.  police are the angels in the city often outnumbered, have their family threatened while you help the other side so they can fight another day, great

Comment422	As a true Christians, you should advice the rioters to stop the violence against other people. What you are doing is condoning their violence to continue, what then when rioters have killed people already? Are you going to jail for them and let them continue killing other people. When people are gang beaten and harassed when they have different opinion, how come you are not there to protect them. Why your not ashame of these acts.<br />What I see is your using Christianity as a cover to bash police and further your own interests. If you are really concern with the children,you would have bring them back to their parents instead of encouraging them to riot. As an overseas Catholic, I really cannot understand why so many Catholics and Christians in Hong Kong are supporting these violence, have you forgotten what Jesus Christ has taught us. Have you forgotten why He died to save us. Have you ask yourself are you being led by false prophets the Bible has warn us about to do evil acts.

Comment 427.1	@The Angriest Canadian but you are always watvhing them to jail or die
Comment 427.2	@The Angriest Canadian not you need to educated yourself! I been following news on the protest from the start. These rioters are the one taking away everything. Go watch the news before you comment.<br /><br />They are destroying themselves.
Comment 427.3	When everything is about to be taken from you. It is your right and within our natural instinct as humans, to protect that “Everything ”. But the one thing you do NOT have the right to do is take everything from anyone, or expect people to allow it to happen.<br /><br />Aka, you need to educate yourself and shut up.
Comment 427.4	Yeah this is not helping them at all.<br /><br />Having love and compassion for someone also means that when someone is doing something wrong, we don&#39;t side with them and letting them learn it the hard way. Protecting them like this will only continue to create problem for themselves and others.
Comment428	These are supporters of anti china protesters paid by UK &amp; USA
Comment429	I don&#39;t think there&#39;s many Hong Kongers left in that police force tbh...
Comment430	I don&#39;t care for Christianity, but those volunteers are doing their best.<br />The protestors are understandably very angry.<br />The police are failing in their duties.  &quot;Whatever&quot; is not something a police officer should ever say.  Encouraging someone to attack them is the attitude of a thug, not a member of law enforcement.  Then you look at the unnecessary beatings and you can tell they&#39;ve lost all moral authority.
Comment 430.1	Jin Tao yeah so it’s not a possible reason for why they’re doing it. Would u risk 10 years of ur future, possibly getting ur arms broken, shot in the eye, near death beatings for 3000 dollars reasonably enough u wouldn’t be doing it
Comment 430.2	Moonov that’s why what they are doing is unacceptable!!!!
Comment 430.3	Like let’s pretend it’s for selfish reasons k but if they were so selfish who tf would go out and get beat up maybe go to jail get more beat up in jail for that amount of money
Comment 430.4	Jin Tao that’s what I’m saying it’s not reasonable or even plausible to think they would throw away their future for 3000 dollars so obviously it’s not real
Comment 430.5	Potatoe Beans that’s the sad part of HK, they can sell the country for 3000 dollars. The education system is a failure
Comment431	Glory to HK!  Even the youth of HK know China is increasing its tyranny and oppression of HK.  Independence for HK is the only way to resolve this issue. Power to the people!

Comment433	These yellow-vest volunteers are so kind to the protesters and police.  Unfortunately, the Hong Kong police only treat them as “yellow objects” and kicked them in the street.
Comment434	The whole protest seriously causes severe impact to the economy not only in HK but internationally. They ain’t wrong to strive for the freedom but at the same time there’s a lot of huge damages and losses made are unrepairable while they are fighting for the right. There’s no 100% right or wrong for the polices and Protestants, as both parties also have their own perspectives and responsibilities. I just hope this can be stopped ASAP so that Hong Kong won’t be a history from the map.
Comment435	"Old fart needs to keel. Over and die. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23turd"">#turd</a>"
Comment436	Biased reporting. This people obstructs police to deal with rioters who attacked police with petrol bombs, bricks, acid, catapults and other hand to hand weapons. Really disgusting to create the impression that these violent hooligans are just ”innocent child”. HK is currently being terrorized by these rioters and anyone who oppose them get threaten, beat up or business destroy. They even commit racially motivated attack on people simply because they are from China. All of their actions are justified under their twisted version of ”democracy”. This rioters do not represent majority of people in Hong Kong. If this happens in UK will BBC be so sympathetic to these young hooligans?
Comment 436.1	i am very sad  use god nane to protect the kids. advise the kids fon involve this activities is not good for the kids  their future  will destroy.
Comment 436.2	If rioters did not attack the police or blocking roads I very much doubt the police would attack them. HK has peaceful protests for decades with zero trouble. If this happens in US many people would be dead by now. This rioters do not represent all the people in HK, their version of ”democracy” is more akin to Nazism and normal citizens are currently being terrorized by them. Lastly, you may not realise, even if China allows HK independence, HK will struggle just to survive - no water, electricity, food or business..... HK is a trading middleman to China... You might not like them but they need them to survive.<br /><br />Also like to point out these rioters, or the ones behind them, have been using a lot of dirty tricks like fake news and PR spin to get people angry to join their cause
Comment 436.3	At least learn to spell &#39;biased&#39; properly.
Comment 436.4	John Smith the police are shooting people with rubber bullets, spraying tear gas, kicking, punching, beating people with batons, the communist Chinese government has hired thugs, attacked companies for defending HK, arrested people on the mainland while also silencing any dissidence online. Currently China has 1+million muslims in internment camps. The entire world is watching this tragedy, and in Canada we stand with the people of HK. China is a disgusting nation and we want no part of you, or what you represent in the world.

Comment438	will they do the same in front of tanks sent to round them up to send them to reeducation camps?
Comment 438.1	If they send the tanks I don&#39;t think they will be left with much options to decide from.
Comment439	THE BRITS sold drugs to Chinese to poison them and invaded China and stole HK. The BRITS invaded so many lands and genocided the natives. How could it be very Christian ? Christians or else should stop politicising religions for political power.

Comment 439.2	"@Richard Yang The &quot;golden doors&quot; stay shut for economic migrants-very different from the refugees who flee war and persecution. As it happens, I have worked in vocational training programs that help recent arrivals (i.e. refugees) get certificates and find a job. That&#39;s just how much effort I put into faking it./s<br /><br /><br /><br />Could the immigration process here be more acessible to legit refugees? Certainly, and I have been supporting the relevant parties (yes, you heard right...partIES plural). <br /><br /><br /><br />More importantly, did you just try to justify your human rights abuses by pointing at someone else again? Like &quot;nevermind that I murdered a guy, officer, look at the robbery over there&quot;. Also, in what world does barring entry equal ethnic cleansing and mass imprisonment?<br /><br /><br />@Joko Widodo: fair enough that Indonesia distrusts the U.S., but this article here says they&#39;re also scared of offending their top trading partner, China, and giving domestic extremists ammunition by admitting muslims abroad are oppressed by said trading partner:&quot;We did not want to engage in their [Uygur persecution] narrative because it would only empower the Islamists and radicals belonging to the opposition.&quot;...Oh and, what surprise, the &quot;opposition&quot; is the Papua Independence Movement.

He would be undermining himself by crticizing someone else&#39;s mistreatment of ethnic minorities."
Comment 439.3	@Lau Z KEEP DREAMING and destroying HK and think you still have $$$$$$$$$$......<br />You guys should be arrested and punished to repay all the damages or send to RE EDUCATION CAMPS in inner Mongolia doing sweatshop labor to repay all your damages. <br /><br /><br />CHINESE and HK immigration should keep an eyes on overseas HK ers coming back to Hong Kong, if they find you doing illegal activities then they should deport you and ban you from ever set feet on CHINESE soil.
Comment 439.4	@Lau Z Why don&#39;t you protest in front of QE II&#39;s palace and 10 Downing st? Tell your WHITE MASTERS to give your remaining HK friends and cousins REAL UK PASSPORT just like yours, not the FAKED BNO ones which are bullshit. Will you ? Your WHITE MASTERS think they can come and go into their colonies and live there forever at will but they prohibit the colonies residents to move to other colonies or to UK to settle down legally. Why don&#39;t you protest on this matter ? That is racism.
Comment440	Im not mad or supporting anyone but I truly have mad respect for the youth of HK
Comment 440.1	Respect? You respect these youth that beat people up who don&#39;t agree with their views? Is that democracy? Respect youth that smash stop lights, businesses, vandals, and block the roads? Mind boggling respect.
Comment 440.2	@Sylas Grayson well, I am pretty sure that you don&#39;t live in Hong Kong because you don&#39;t seem to know what&#39;s exactly is happening  and how most of the people really think over there.
Comment441	Teach the rioters vandalism is a sin. Teach them to stop vandalizing first.  Instead of obstructing police from doing the arrest and calling that act as peaceful resolver.
Comment 441.1	Don&#39;t drag God&#39;s name into this worldly mess. Like you will never put those you care so much into this mess. Only hypocrites will use God&#39;s name for their own sake and pretend to be holy.  Still instead of obstructing the police to enforce peace and order. Teach the rioters to stop messing around. Otherwise authority has every rights to apprehend offenders. If police is above the law they would use live bullets long time back.
Comment 441.2	Ask yourself the question “Is Finger pointing applying the two commandments.”
Comment 441.3	RIoters reasoning is twisted and cannot think straight anymore.  There behavior and attitude will also be aggressive and violent.  Hard to restore peace in hk for people&#39;s attitude and behavior is the hardest part to change.  How will dialog works when rioters reasoning is twisted.  Rioters now are like zombies. You cannot talk them out or have peace pack with them. Rioters cannot think like human any more.  Only one way to get rid of the zombies because they spread.
Comment 441.4	"@Barb Wilson<br />Yes. You are right about “golden rule” and Jesus responded about “golden rule” or greatest commandment in the Law. And it is in Matthew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwjGKt4EYjQ&amp;t=22m34s"">22:34</a>-40. But more specifically 37-40 <br /><br />36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”<br /><br />37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’[c] 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”<br /><br />And when we (all the people in Hong Kong) apply these two commandments in our actions we will be able find a peaceful solutions of justice."

Comment 445.5	Weird - Did you forget to take your meds this morning?
Comment446	Young kids know nothing about politics and they are easily misled by wrong information, that is why the kids are not given right to vote until they are 18 or older in most of the countries. Why news media encourage little kids to get involved in politics?
Comment 446.1	"@Ezra Zou They are brainwash in school. Problem with HK education system. I can see video that teacher support them to be <a href=""http://violent.hk/"">violent.HK</a> gov should hit hard on this school and teacher."
Comment 446.2	30% of those arrested are under the age of 18. Peer pressure is too real.
Comment 446.3	Actually, the main body of the Culture Revolution, which those anti-CN condemned, is young kids. So in that case, they say those youth were brainwashed instead of fighting for their future.
Comment 446.4	they were &quot;son of others&quot;.
Comment 446.5	News media need money .The reporter need to be paid. You think they work for free for &quot;freedom&quot;? The more chaotic the better for them. Thay are Evil
Comment447	The BBC is financed solely by the British Government. With money stolen from the public.

Comment 448.1	肉红烧 lol I don’t have any misinformation. Google it, watch the news, speak to someone from HK. The Chinese gov is disgusting, and in the western world we’re all aware of it.
Comment 448.2	@Cory Bertrim easy buddy.  You got too much misinformation...
Comment 448.3	So you’re referring to China when you say terrorists and thugs correct? The country that has a million+ muslims in intermittent camps? Has hired thugs to beat protestors? Given police orders to spray gas, kick, punch and beat down any oppression? Not to mention the campaign to silence anyone who speaks out online. The communist party of China is a disgusting dog and no one is fooled. The world is watching you, and in Canada we’re disgusted by what you’ve done.
Comment 448.4	the pastors of Protestants were creative.
Comment449	Guard Children by not letting them to face the law for beating people,throw petrol bomb ,damage public property. What a great deed. When they grow adult,they wouldn&#39;t know how to be a responsible people.
Comment 449.1	@Derek Lim You&#39;re actually retarded😂
Comment 449.2	@Derek Lim You ran out of points to argue with me and now you have to call an adult a kid and yourself a daddy to make you look better lmao
Comment 449.3	@Lau Z You moron. Did I say I&#39;m from HongKong. Keep guessing where I&#39;m from. Chinese is everywhere in the world. Crack your head please. Daddy will give you sweet if you guess correct. So fun toying with a kid

Comment 452.2	@Laurent Loh truth is you either stop violence or support violence. [I know there&#39;re cases which violence is necessary, but don&#39;t do something bad and blame others]
Comment 452.3	@Laurent Loh so why all the other &#39;peaceful&#39; protesters near the mobs didn&#39;t stop that violence but using umbrellas to cover those rioters?
Comment 452.4	they were just disguised coverage of mobs.
Comment453	They call policemen :&quot; gangdom&quot;. Many protesters still believe some Hk cops are disguised by PLA（Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army）. Just because some PLA can speak Cantonese. But they are many different intonation. I know this, because my home is 2km from HK. Like China&#39;s resident ID card, Some protesters still believe it is Police id card. I think the biggest problem is that young people in Hk don&#39;t know China, Although, Hk is belong China in law. If China want Hk people know more about China, the protesters will ask US and UK for help(Like HK protesters in 2017). How China goverment can slove this problem?

Comment458	free Hong Kong.<br />democracy is on the way to Hong Kong.
Comment459	Why don&#39;t I see these so called &#39;protectors&#39; protecting the elderly who were beaten almost to death by these young radicals. Why don&#39;t I see these so called &#39;protectors&#39; project people who openly speak against violence and were almost beaten to death by these young radicals. BBC should watch the interview with Traudl Junge, Hitler&#39;s secretary, in which she explained, &quot;youth is not an excuse&quot;!
Comment 459.1	Emma Grace You still didn’t explain how exactly the freedom of HK people was taken away by the government.
Comment 459.2	White Jose this is like talking to a victim of Stockholm syndrome. Look, individuals who hurt Innocents should be held accountable. However, it is also ultimately the government&#39;s fault that innocent people are getting hurt. If the government actually afforded their citizens liberties, the citizens would have no reason to fight. As it is, the government is stifling free thought and in response the people revolt. This is basic sociology. If a government gives people rights and freedoms, then the people have no reason to revolt. If they oppress them, the natural response is backlash. So ultimately the government must cease this oppression in order to stop the riots. Blame your government, not the people who are brave enough to actually make a change and have some agency over their own lives.
Comment 459.3	Emma Grace It is double standards. To my knowledge, the HK police have been extremely restrained compared with those in America. You keep mentioning that HK people have lost their freedom. Can you explain it in detail? I simply do not get your point. You said a civil war would happen if this was in America. Can you explain what does your “this” actually mean?
Comment 459.4	White Jose why must the protest be peaceful? China is beyond deserving a peaceful response at this point. These members of their communities have a right to be outraged and fight back against this grave danger to their freedom. Like I said, if this was America, we would be having a civil war by now.
Comment 459.5	Emma Grace “appropriate reaction” - key words here. Even the police manage to arrest some “peaceful protesters”, they are not directly sending them to jails. A judicial process needs to be gone through before any judgement is made. To be accused of committing crimes, evidence needs to be shown and examined. If “peaceful protesters” indeed react appropriately, no one will be able to send them to jail. They will only be imprisoned if sufficient evidence points to their crimes. If they think the police have violated laws, they better send them to courts, instead of committing crimes with them.

Comment 462.5	@u continue to show off your arrogance , you guys have the right to ask people shut up and called it democracy, that&#39;s what happened every day in Hongkong.

Comment464	There is a very strong reason the Hong Kong government refuses the demand for an independent probe into the police brutality. This is true that the police had abused their power against the protesters and the volunteers. The policemen had lost their rationale to bully the volunteers.
Comment 464.1	@u How do u define dictator mind? Did the citizen suffer ? Are the citizen suffer from hunger? Are you sure you have freedom when British rule?  As state Law is define by the state.If you break the law then you get arrested.If you dont like the country ,you can leave. That why there a word call &quot;migrate&quot; Dont blame police,,blame yourself because from video everyone know that rioter are violent. You can see mostly people comment on English dont side violent.
Comment 464.2	@Derek Lim If the law is just a dictator&#39;s mind, do you obey it ?
Comment 464.3	@u Why ask stupid question? Law is a set of rules decided by a particular state meant for the purpose of keeping the peace and security of society.<br />Courts or police may enforce this system of rules and punish people who break the laws, such as by paying a fine, or other penalty including jail.
Comment 464.4	@Derek Lim what is law? opinion from the public or just someone&#39;s mind?
Comment 464.5	@u is it important if you dont break the law? Only those break the law are worry.

Comment470	I’m pretty surprised that an English news channel made a very elementary mistake in the vocabulary used on the video title. It should be rioters and not protesters. Protest is used when there is no violence and vandalism.
Comment471	This BBC video is outright offensive. How can they portray this man as doing God&#39;s work when he&#39;s supporting violence and destruction. Is BBC now saying that God supports violence and destruction of Hong Kong? I hope the Hong Kong authorities will ban this kind of militant christianity and christian terrorists. They have no place in our society.

Comment 473.1	@Leopard Man As I apologized, I was really emotional at that time. But I don&#39;t want in the end, it&#39;s a bunch of kids who keep doing violent protest and take the blame. It&#39;s ok to encourage kids to think politically and express their opinion, but it&#39;s not acceptable for me to praise these kids&#39; behaviour or to encourage them to strike on the street to smash. What if one day, it&#39;s getting too bad, that somebody needs to take the blame. Sincerely, do you think it&#39;s the kids should be sacrificed?????

Comment 480.4	"​@Oscar Mike I saw 12-year old girl from Shenzhen, speaks fluent German and English, mocking the Economist&#39;s attitude toward Donald Trump, while at the HK kids I know ( I mean they are locals), some of them would insult others who have different opinions, some got bullied and struggled to fall asleep. I think the world itself is a chaotic place, I don&#39;t bother, but I wish every kids would be allowed to grow up peacefully, and if they are very lucky, happily. Of course they could have their own opinion, and if they are above 16, they should be allowed to vote. But never being exploited on the street... ..."

Comment482	If this group&#39;s aim is to prevent violence, where were they when the rioters crippled the train system? Where were they when the rioters set up road blocks to attack police after their shifts? Where were they when the rioters vandalized companies that spoke against the violent protests? Where were they when the rioters beat up bystanders for filming their criminal acts?

Comment 484.1	@Cowardly Custard They beaten elderly Chinese nationalists
Comment 484.2	beating on isolated policemen. is good ?
Comment485	The rioters had been terrorising hong kong citizen almost killing several innocent citizen without remorse due to these beautification of the mob. They blocked road intimidate citizen to support them even resort to media manipulation through foreign media. Road blocks were set to attacked families of police force. Attacking police with acid thrown from buildings. Using weapons like bow and arrow, spear, knifes, steel ball catapult and yet you do not show this side of the story isn&#39;t this unfair and unprofessional of a international press?
Comment 485.1	Cory Bertrim ok last thing, China had never stopping its citizens from leaving unless they committed crime. Why not all these country which criticized China packed up all the ‘Hongkonger’ and Muslims to there land to enjoy freedom and liberty? And why don’t these people go to those ‘free nations’ in Mideast and Africa? I love to see that. Stop saying Take action!
Comment 485.2	Cory Bertrim right now people can only be in the list for three reason: first you have debt but refuse to pay even you have other properties. Why the fk they should still get loan from the bank? Second, people refuse to fulfill the judgement of the court. Mostly happen when the criminal refuse to give apology to the victim or people ran away during probation. Yes even committing a crime won’t put you in the list. Last, violating public rules for several times. I think it is fair to not provide someone with public service if he or she keeps damaging it. And most importantly being in the list having a time limit from one month to two year. It is always chance to makeup the mistake. Let me know where is not fair.
Comment 485.3	Cory Bertrim ok I think I will explain one thing you mentioned to prove that you may need to do more research about China. About social credit system. You know that some Chinese are in the losing-credit list so they can’t get large loan from bank or buy domestic flight ticket. do you know how would you get in there?
Comment 485.4	Cory Bertrim I can go through every events you mentioned and tell you our side of story. But to save time I would say you don’t understand China. In China, human rights means equality more than freedom. For example, the tuition for China’s best university is 700 dollars a year including housing. And they don’t have things like recommendation letter and characteristic score, one just need to study really hard to get a good score to go wherever he want. Furthermore, no Chinese need to be friends with media to become popular to be elected as governors. An officer is mostly valued by how much poverty rate he reduced and how much economic numbers increased to get promoted.
Comment 485.5	Cory Bertrim every country has its dark side and bad history. Tell me what happen with those Natives in the Canada school. We hope it could get better, not use it as labels.
Comment486	I&#39;m Catholic and our local parish Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Wanchai is the safe haven of these blackshirt terrorists. I&#39;m catholic but I disagree with these rioters and terrorists. Our local parish priest and nuns provide secret safe haven to injured rioters. On many occasions, our local parish has been turned into the repository of riot gears, riot weapons, riot masks and riot petrol bombs. I hope the Hong Kong police can save our local parish from becoming a terrorist haven. We just want our local parish back. No one has the right to use violence in the name of God. That is blasphemy.
Comment487	A group of thugs. The Communist Party is too weak. If it happened in the UK, it would have been annihilated by Mrs Thatcher&#39;s Army long ago.
Comment 487.1	Hong Kong is not ruled by the Communist party...we would have sent the tanks long time ago!
Comment488	Hong Kong deserves independence!
Comment 488.1	I agree...we should give them independence then cut the water and electricity.<br />They are no more part of China
Comment489	children in HongKong are innocent.Because they are laking  some knowledge to discribe the situration and they are utlized by some color revolution.
Comment490	What does red china do to Christians?
Comment 490.1	What they deserve to be done to every fascist religious fundamentalist
Comment491	<i>This is madness!</i><br /><i>- Madness?! THIS. IS. POLITICS!</i><br /><br />It makes me sad that some things never seem to change at all. People hating people because of colour, religion or political beliefs is medieval and should have been overcome by now. But I guess humans are to stupid and lazy to overcome their inherited fears with logic and open minds.
Comment492	Admirable work. All freedom loving people across the world stand with the people of Hong Kong. Your rights and liberties are inalienable, humans are born to be free.
Comment 492.1	@Masked Singer -- And I say again, your question is starting off with a premise that is leading and employs whataboutery. <br /><br /><br /><br />I&#39;m not an expert on HK history and I don&#39;t know the intricacies of British Rule in Hong Kong, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s safe to assume it wasn&#39;t all sunshine and rainbows because it never is with the Brits. But what I am saying now is this; the current status quo in HK is not right. The people don&#39;t have the ability to replace those who make the laws in their country, they aren&#39;t able to remove those in power that are acting against their interests. They simply cannot hold their politicians to account. <br /><br /><br /><br />Your point about China becoming a democracy is noted, but I highly doubt, no matter how educated the Chinese become, that your absolutist and authoritarian regime will ever permit full democracy. Is that what you&#39;re endorsing? If that&#39;s the case, I understand if you don&#39;t wanna say, because I wouldn&#39;t want the authorities paying you a visit... <br /><br /><br /><br />Those democracies you&#39;re thinking of, aren&#39;t democracies. In a place like the US though, where congress is held in the pockets of lobbyists, the people still have the final say. And we&#39;re seeing that with the progressive movement taking hold in that country. And you can apologise for China&#39;s absolutism all you want, but name a country that has the economic mass of China that suppresses dissent in the way we&#39;re seeing in China, they use technology in a way that makes dystopian sci-fi look like mickey mouse.
Comment 492.2	@Brave Men Behaving Boldly  I ask again, what freedoms have been lost? <br />As for suffrage, there was a framework that conformed to HK&#39;s constitution, but the anti Beijing Legco members shot it down. <br />Also, please name a successful case of a developing country transforming into a democratic state. For every 1 you name, I can list 2. Democracies need an educated voter base and China is not there yet. Countries without suffrage can thrive if the government is accountable to it&#39;s people Plus I can list plenty of examples where democracies have legislature that goes against the public will, thanks to legalized corruption called lobbying. <br /><br />As for your point on young people...should households let teenagers make decisions because they are the future? Older people have lived under both British and Chinese rule. Some have also lived abroad in democratic countries like me. We would be better informed on the possible paths for HK than high school and university students.
Comment 492.3	@Masked Singer -- The PRC went mental at every attempt of democratization of Hong Kong during the British governance. However, it wouldn&#39;t be right to say you&#39;re entirely wrong. British rule was problematic and had it&#39;s many flaws, but how does that justify the current state of Hong Kong?<br /><br /><br /><br />Your question is starting off with a bad premise. Democracy and freedoms are objective rights. It doesn&#39;t matter the history of a region, that&#39;s just plain whataboutery. What matters is that people don&#39;t have fair representation in the body that makes their laws; the people can&#39;t remove their leader on a fixed term basis. If what was happening in Hong Kong happened in any western country, where democracy and liberty is held in high regard, radical change would have to be implemented. <br /><br /><br /><br />Hong Kong is a top-bottom system, the people have very little say and can&#39;t create change at the ballot box. When the vast majority of the populace wants change, the only way they can get it, is by going to the streets. That&#39;s not how a good system works. Also, most of these people are young, they are the future, you ought to listen to them.<br /><br /><br />Why would anyone want to live in a society like China? No Hong Konger wants their society to be brought to China&#39;s level of state absolutism.
Comment 492.4	How noble of you. Please list what freedoms have been lost by HK people since the handover. The election of the legislative council is more democratic compared to British rule. Civil liberties are intact. Meanwhile, these rioters are suppressing freedoms of speech and are infringing on my rights as a HK citizen.
Comment493	Thank for your dedication, protecting our kids from being tortured, beaten up...Please, stand with Hong Kong, saving our kids from having a totalitarian government in the future as well. They are supposed to have a happy, stressless and freedom life and future instead of exposing tear gas, bullets... every day.
Comment 493.1	Yup agree kids should be protected, certainly from being indoctrinated, misled and manipulated by adults to further their own political ambitions and greed. You can start by revamping the education system and follow China&#39;s example of creating a large wealthy middle class rather than the US&#39; example where the rich gets richer and poor gets poorer.
Comment494	Dont be stupid old man.<br />Go home. These rogue protesters deserve to be taught s lesson
Comment495	Stay strong, stay safe! My prayers are with you all, Hong Kong protesters!!!!
Comment 495.1	"HK protesters still have the freedom to protest for the 17 weeks now? <br /><br />And don&#39;t forget to investigate the following violence against the police officers.

Comment496	Calling Mighty Mouse(PLA).....
Comment497	I’m a Christian and our Faith has stated to follow whatever leaders have been placed even if we may disagree with them.....
Comment 497.1	I think it’s just best if everyone to just have faith in the Government, like it really does wonders. I mean Singapore has pretty strict laws that even Singaporeans find it weird but we all have trust in each other, the result, a nation that nobody 50 years ago would expect to prosper so much

Comment498	There are hundreds of violent protest footage and BBC got none?
Comment 498.1	BBC   Big Bully Cock roach
Comment499	This BBC propaganda video comes a bit too late now. The damage has been done. After the US-sponsored rioters were caught on cam attacking old people in MTR stations and beating up elderly people in the streets and bullying a lone granny, the image of the US-sponsored rioters has forever been tarnished. In Asia, you don&#39;t attack old people. In many cases, it&#39;s even considered impolite to talk back to the elderly. The US-sponsored rioters have become so violent because they are too westernized and Americanized.
Comment 499.1	@Masked Singer and you&#39;re the perfect specimen of a clown but whose complaining?
Comment 499.2	@Amir Shehu  lol ok. You&#39;re a perfect specimen of the Dunning Kruger effect.
Comment 499.3	@Masked Singer I can but not for you. Go cry in a corner somewhere
Comment 499.4	@Amir Shehu  I&#39;m sure you must be a winner in life, if you cannot string together simple thoughts. I pity you.
Comment 499.5	@Edgar Edgar I dont encourage shit you dumb ass, why do you encourage the police to shoot normal people?
Comment500	This is big shit, failure and hypocrisy of international media...that they starting showing protests in hong kong but for last 63 days....whatever that is happening in KASHMIR is not seen by them......those KASMIRIs are killed for no means...no fpod is there...no health care....nothing.....just treatment worst than animals
Comment501	A part of rioters, but play another role to destroy the order of Hongkong, even though they call them “protector of younger” .
Comment502	Free hongkong from beating peaceful protestors like these
Comment 502.1	"I encourage people to read the message board <a href=""http://lihkg.com/"">LIHKG.COM</a>. It is used by protestors and you can read first hand on what they are up to. It&#39;s in Chinese, but a lot of browsers can auto translate now. You&#39;ll get conspiracy theories that will put Alex Jones to shame. You&#39;ll hear debates on which properties to trash next. You&#39;ll see personal information of people who oppose their movement being published. It&#39;s quite entertaining."
Comment503	很想知道香港抗议是不是永远也不会结束？
Comment 503.1	@Königstiger  If that&#39;s the case, it means never. The 5 demands were changed midway, and some of the demands are impossible asks.
Comment 503.2	SPACE DEEP <br />It ends when the 5 demands are met
Comment504	Who EIse is a true fan Of Hong Kong &amp; BBC News? 😍 I’m gifting 10 subs at my next Tech Giveaway. LIVE on YouTube!🌹 SUB NOW!😍
Comment505	Why don’t you say “protect kids, away from politics”? <br /><br />I don’t want my kids to watch media like BBC
Comment 505.1	@Katy Ho if you are from HK I would say you should be happy these people are fighting for your rights. I&#39;ve never loved in China but I do believe I know enough about life there. I don&#39;t believe you want to live under those conditions and most of all laws.
Comment 505.2	@T_T Don&#39;t get me wrong, I mean that it is impossible to get rid of politics in our daily life, therefore I kind of disagree with @Aha Ya &#39;s comment...I&#39;m from HK tho
Comment 505.3	arc arcon hope BBC will show peaceful environment protest in London.
Comment 505.4	Katy Ho too early for them to get into these dirty thing
Comment 505.5	@Katy Ho if that&#39;s how you really feel I hope you are actually living in china. If you are how are you watching YouTube? Isn&#39;t it banned in China? So you must be breaking the law.
Comment506	Normally we call this Obstruction of justice...
Comment 506.1	"@Seamus Harper And those students beat their teacher and Prof. in Campus, the police was not able to save them because of those &quot;Protectors&quot;...That&#39;s totally unacceptable.<br />We could not see the whole truth just beacuse many reporters are helping those rioters, just like that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-GR88q8pIw"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-GR88q8pIw</a>"
Comment 506.2	@Bismark T8 You mean like the one they tried to protect, but there were too many rioters and they couldn&#39;t stop them. And yes G20 wasn&#39;t good. But these are people trying to protect their democracy. PS: I am german too.
Comment 506.3	@Seamus Harper  There are videos of this group acting as a first defense for rioters when they are trashing a train station in the background. The police could not get past them without using force and could only watch the rioters destroy public property.
Comment 506.4	Seamus Harper BTW I live in Germany, been through G20 Hamburg, so yes, I support all police using necessary and justify violence to protect citizens!
Comment 506.5	Seamus Harper You mean those innocent citizens got beat en by those rioters?
Comment507	Protecting rioters that are vandalising Hong Kong. Typical BBC propaganda BS. So transparent, too. Laughable.
Comment508	Doing devil&#39;s work. UK and USA are doing devil&#39;s work worldwide.
Comment 508.1	"USA can&#39;t cure the whole world and the US government sometimes did some messed up shit for its own interest. But please don&#39;t speak against something simply because the US govenment or CIA supports that. If you live in a free and democratic world and speak in favor of tyranny, then be fear that one day yourself will live in tyranny and you will know what it is like living that kind of life. There has been too much blood in our land and there are still no signs that things will get better. Living in this old continent is a curse, the ghost will not stop haunting us."
