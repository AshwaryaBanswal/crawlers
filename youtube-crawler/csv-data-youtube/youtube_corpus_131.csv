Comment7	Junker did not rule out a deal. He’s being non- committal. I’m sure the EU wouldn’t want to be blackmailing Britain and be the cause of no deal. They’re far more astute than that and it doesn’t depend on Junker anyway.<br /><br />They will give the extension but it won’t be binding and we could come out anytime between now and then but it would be more orderly.
Comment8	Pissed........ AGAIN &quot; I&#39;m not in charge of Westminster &quot; smirk smirk wink wink
Comment9	For once we see the man snap. He is allowed to, the Britts have really tested his patience.
Comment 9.1	The Britts have tested everyone&#39;s patience. They can start colonizing Mars... AND LOOT  its wealth like they&#39;ve done around the globe.
Comment10	<b>He&#39;s a bit of an old tosser is Jean-Claude Juncker. He shuffles around the EU Parliament buildings (usually in his bedroom slippers), like someone&#39;s angry, old, senile, Great Uncle, chunnering and ranting at anyone who accidentally, or dares to make eye contact with him. It&#39;s hard to believe he&#39;s only 64 years-old. Perhaps he just had a really difficult paper round as a young teen in Luxembourg!</b>
Comment11	BBC ,why don&#39;t you like democracy?

Comment16	He has no standing to say that. He hasn&#39;t the authority. Only the EU group has it.
Comment17	Politicians should earn less than toilet cleaners
Comment18	After the UK leaves the European Union, we will love to see how the British are doing later on,there will be a laugh 😂
Comment19	Important to note that those European leaders who are ruling out an extension they are infact so desperate to get May s deal through because they know the effect of that deal will have on the UNION and  further  weakening of  it s status. <br /><br />This will give France,Germany and Ireland the golden chance to drag investments and buisness from the UK to them selfs.<br />As right now Macron isn&#39;t interested in having the UK as part of the EU. .and he is hoping for a some  damage to the UK as a major economy with major currency. This is all potentially interesting for France and the others. <br />Not really wanting an extension and hoping the deal will be voted for...is actually a wishful thinking for some European leaders. <br /><br />So this Brexit turned out to be all about buisness and companies interest and not in  any way people interest.
Comment20	my guess:<br />Bojo made concessions to get a deal on a condition:   EU will veto any xtension.
Comment21	Fair &amp; balanced?! Well in the end brits are the one whose getting the short straw anyway.
Comment22	Excellent. No deal now!
Comment23	Just kick us out, please 👍
Comment24	First time the German Scrote has done something right , I wonder if he was sober or soaring with the Eagles again .
Comment 24.1	1. He is not German. 2. What is wrong with being German?
Comment25	NO EXTENSION CDE CORBYNOV !! WE LEAVE ON 31st OCT. DEAL OR NO DEAL. BORRIS WILL SEND HILARY&#39;S LETTER, SOUNDS LIKE CLINTON WROTE THE BILL ? THIS IS MAGGIE THATCHER STUFF NO B.S.  GO AND SUCK EGGS SCOTLAND !!!
Comment26	Loooool what a cook, love it
Comment27	55k views but 75 million followers.really come on utube
Comment28	He didn&#39;t rule it out, he merely said it was unnecessary because a deal has been struck. <br /><br />Boris&#39;s May deal is unacceptable to the UK and they know it, but it&#39;s a good deal for the EU. <br /><br />So Boris won&#39;t get his deal through parliament and won&#39;t get no-deal either. <br /><br />Then he can call a general election and claim that he got us Brexit but that parliament stopped it.<br /><br />It&#39;s all about BLAME, nothing to do with a good deal or not.
Comment29	I&#39;m speaking .. like donald trump maybe boris should address the media more like this
Comment30	And with that, Boris can &quot;hard brexit&quot; on October 31st without breaking the law of the act of a few weeks ago, he can &quot;request an extension&quot; as required knowing it will be rejected.
Comment31	GOOD COS WE DONT WANT AN EXTENSION WE DONT WANT A DEAL WE WANT TO LEAVE YOUR CORRUPT UNELECTED DICTATORSHIP WITH NO STRINGS
Comment 31.1	Then why the fuck do your politicians keep asking for extensions, you two tongued fucks?<br />And quit with the lies. European representatives are just as elected as your representatives. Nobody directly voted for Boris to become your PM, they voted for Theresa May in the last election, so shut up.
Comment32	Would somebody please ask him if he&#39;s happy about the deal?
Comment33	No article 50, because no extension. 拜拜 Britain..
Comment34	But the problem with what he said, is that “if we have a deal, then there’s no need for proroguing[?extension?]”, and that slip of his tongue, could be about something that BOJO the clownish 🤡 tyrant said to him.....  But the most telling thing, is that the no to an extension, is based on having a deal, and BOJO the clownish 🤡 tyrant, is not allowed to dictate to parliament, on any matter, let alone, on us having to accept that deal... Because we are a parliamentary democracy, and that means he needs a majority in the house, but he doesn’t, because he is a minority Johnson, in every sense(if which he has nothing, in the common(s) way)<br />     He shouldn’t be celebrating yet, because “there’s many a slip, twixt cup and lip”. “Especially because pride, goes before a fall”, and “the higher up the ladder, the further you fall”........
Comment 34.1	I think he is saying &#39;prolongation&#39; - ie, no extension as a deal is done.
Comment35	Clickbait... <br /><br />Juncker ruled it out prorogation due to current standing of a deal, nothing more!  <br /><br />BBC news, stop misleading the public with distortions and false reporting!
Comment36	I am a Kurd from Iraqi Kurdistan. Why are you still silent? Why don&#39;t you say anything?Do you think we are animals? Do you think we are not Elissa&#39;s operator? Who investigated humanity?Believe you from hundreds of times, but they are writers, a false chord. Your state is false, but we prayed to avenge all who lied with us, all we want to I demand that the human language and Kurdish language, but you consider this animals without lying Adib but you.Thank you for the BBC channel
Comment37	THE BBC IS THE #1 FAKE NEWS ORGANISATION IN THE UK - THEY WERE BACKING COMMUNIST CORBYN ALL THE WAY AND FOSTERED AND PROMOTED A BREXIT FAILURE - THE BBC IS A COMMUNIST ORGANISATION AND COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THE 52% OF PEOPLE WHO VOTED LEAVE !!!!! THE BBC STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN AND IS IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS FAKE NEWS CNN AND MSNBC IN THE USA !!!!
Comment38	HURRAH - HURRAH - BORIS DELIVERED THE BREXIT DEAL AND FOLLOWS DEMOCRACY AND LISTEN TO THE 52% WHO VOTED TO LEAVE THE COMMUNIST EU - WELL DONE BORIS - WELL DONE - CORBYN WANTED TO STAY AND TO TURN THE UK INTO A SOCIALIST COUNTRY - CORBYN WILL BE IN THE POLITICAL DOLDRUMS FOR DECADES TO COME AND BORIS APPROVAL RATINGS ARE GOING THRU THE ROOF AND CORBYNS IS IN THE TOILET !   WE CAN&#39;T WAIT UNTIL THE 31.OCTOBER WERE THE UK WILL LEAVE THE COMMUNIST EU RUN BY THE DICTATORSHIP IN BRUSSELS - CAN&#39;T WAIT UNTIL THE UK IS FINALLY FREE FROM THE MARXIST EU CLUTCHES - AGAIN WELL DONE BORIS - WELL DONE !!!!!
Comment39	Actually it&#39;s not up to Juncker to rule out an extension
Comment 39.1	It isn&#39;t. But it&#39;s still ruled out.<br />It&#39;s been years that the UK has come pleading for extensions with the promise of a deal where they&#39;ve done nothing but fuck about, without coming with a deal or even leaving with no deal as their politicians have moaned about all these years. If the UK wants to leave without a deal then pull the plug. It&#39;s not the EU&#39;s responsibility to kick the UK out. The UK can go out the door themselves.
Comment40	Tell me this Juncker it is a normal man?!.....?
Comment41	IM SPEAKING!
Comment42	DEAL OR NO DEAL, WE ARE OUT ON THE 31ST!!! HAPPY DAYS, REMOANER TEARS INCOMING!!
Comment 42.1	BYE BYE... FELICIA!! NO ONE WILL BE CRYING!  LMAO
Comment43	He didn&#39;t rule out an extension. He said there&#39;s no need for an extension since there&#39;s a deal.
Comment 43.1	Also he doesn&#39;t decide if we can get an extension.
Comment 43.2	That&#39;s exactly how I heard it. No extension IF deal passed on Saturday. Not the same as ruling it out come what may as many seem to think he&#39;s saying.
Comment44	"No Deal .No <a href=""http://border.no/"">Border.No</a> Payments too e u or swinsons hubby."
Comment45	What is wrong with your channel page, it keeps repeating my comments.<br />Nor should we have one.<br />We should have left the EU three whole years ago, but our lackey <br />politicians followed their script and messed around for that time, <br />acting around to make us all bored and stop being such spoilsports.<br />Trouble is, we still want it and we won&#39;t stop until we get it by any means necessary.

Comment50	They are kicking the can off a cliff, and watching it crash out off the cliff. Haha
Comment 50.1	@jimmy2minutes <br />If you follow a path not too steep, why not.<br />Or if you have Messi qualities.
Comment 50.2	@Dutch Man booting a can up a cliff? Any good?
Comment 50.3	Kicking a can down a dead end street has its charm.<br />Running after it to see it go down the cliff, takes some practice.
Comment51	Must be a very favourable deal for the EU then
Comment52	the very best deal was no brexit.
Comment 52.1	and brexit can still be stopped.
Comment53	So MPs vote the deal down and Boris takes us out anyway. Oh I do hope so.
Comment54	&quot;I&#39;m Speaking!!!!!&quot; what a dick Junckers is. That outburst just shows what sort of person he is.
Comment55	He says he&#39;s not in charge of Westminster which is fine but he is controlling them indirectly.
Comment56	Read between the lines, he said if they had a deal they wouldn&#39;t extend the leaving date.  That means Boris still has to write a letter asking for an extention if this deal doesn&#39;t pass.
Comment57	off course he has,the scam is to force refurendum boris deal or remain,leave have been sold out by boris,,
Comment58	Happy because he will possibly get his drinks money from us
Comment 58.1	Yawn.
Comment59	I wonder how much Boris paid him?
Comment60	🇬🇧 Deal still ties us in.🤐 General Election ROUT of mps still regardless.   Abuse of power here and EU, contempt for tratiors.
Comment61	The EU is like a very patient parent...but we have reached our limit...UK´s brexit voters had 3 years to understand how stupid is leaving the EU, if they still want to buy all the BS their leaders are selling them, so be it...I will visit the UK after the civil war you will have
Comment62	I AM SPEAKING
Comment63	Mr. Juncker - the victim of Boris Johnsons manipulation. This statement of Mr. Juncker was the only goal of the whole stage performance about another deal. There was never a new deal planned by Boris Johnson! He just offered rubbish from his fantasy to get an agreement from the EU - on an impossible deal. Because this s... he will try to transform into a no deal Brexit. Luckily it&#39;s not Mr. Junckers decision the grant or refuse another extension. Hopefully the MPs in parliament will know this...
Comment64	junker yunker can nott help you with that ,<br />no  bright prospect with leaving the EU to work with those faraway countries <br />and certainly no better prospect with the  EU in the uncertain Futuress
Comment65	We do not want a referendum. We do not want an extension. We do not want any connection with the EU. We do not want a Deal. Lies all Lies by the corrupt EU. Lying just like they did years ago It was about Trade but it was about building a United State of Europe just like Hitler was trying to achieve. It is not a deal it is a TREATY tying us in the dictatorship of the EU run by the Germans for the Germans they took over 27 nations without firing a single bullet if ever a Country was devious nasty and corrupt  Germany is and always as been .
Comment66	He’s so pissed off 😂
Comment67	YooKai is back in to turmoiiiiiil
Comment68	🇬🇧 &#39;Im Speaking 😠&#39; true🇩🇪 colours coming through. 😁. We not really leaving though as it still ties us in. 😞 May get rejected....round an round an round we go.
Comment69	I thought Drunker had finished his position at the EU?<br />Sorry folks, but they will never, ever let us leave the EU.<br />The elite will simply not allow it.<br />Get ready for more obstacles, pointless parliament conversations and a big event to halt brexit in its tracks.<br />My guess is some sort of war, where the European nations need to be united.<br />We will be conned, believe me.

Comment73	Son of a prominent German during 1941 ruling Europe? War is pointless.
Comment 73.1	Which prominent German? Juncker&#39;s father was a steel worker and the family is from Luxembourg. Or did you refer to Boris&#39; father?
Comment74	The devil&#39;s in the detail
Comment75	Don&#39;t understand the hatred for EU
Comment 75.1	kevin street because they think that the EU is corrupt for the some reason and the other... you know as Nigel Farage loves to exaggerate and manipulate everything 😊

Comment78	Ooof Jo Swinson and her remoaner cronies must be frothing at the mouths.
Comment79	Brits are shooting themselves in the feet by leaving the EU every bit as badly as America shot itself by seating Trumputin in the office fo the president.  How very sad.
Comment 79.1	@glyn hodges LMAO, Natasha!
Comment 79.2	@Old Woman Russia will dominate you Old Woman.  You know it is true.
Comment 79.3	@glyn hodges it does not surprise me in the least that you are just one more lying troll without an argument based on reality, Natasha.  Go eat your borsht.
Comment 79.4	@Old Woman It does not surprise me in the least that you want to go to war with a NATO ally or that you refuse to accept the official employment and growth figures.<br /> Your childish use of Trumputin reveals in a single word all the thoughts you have ever had.
Comment 79.5	@glyn hodges Also, take a look at the REAL employment figures; people are working 3 jobs, now, to make what we used to get for working one... and no benefits, either.  Trumputin has you fooled, but life is more than a PR stunt.  Also; turn on something besides Sky/Faux news... especially today.  The SOB is going to be impeached, shortly; Sondlund has given up the last of the Ukrainian scandal, the military has given up on him for cutting and running on our Kurdish allies, even his own party voted against his foreign policy yesterday.  He&#39;s done.  The big lie is done.  Hope your country recuperates from the same propagandists, as well.
Comment80	Typical rude journalist. Well said junker
Comment 80.1	nah I think he just had a bit of a drunken breakdown and then realised it was being filmed :)
Comment81	What Juncker actually says is the EU won&#39;t grant an extension if not explicitly requested for by the UK. He&#39;s a diplomat using diplomat-speak. Journalists are uneducated idiots for not listening carefully and not asking the right question: would the EU grant an extension if the UK requested for it?<br />When asked whether he rules out an extension, he literally answers &quot;We have a deal so why should we have a prolongation.&quot; Which is factually completely true at this time as far as the EU is concerned. When asked what if Parliament rejects the deal he literally replied that he is not in charge of Westminster. In other words: he rules out an extension until the situation of having a deal changes.<br />(He reacted really angry when the reporter tried to interrupt him answering the same question to another reporter. My former headmaster would have bought Juncker a beer.)
Comment 81.1	Bo Soerjadi... well said.
Comment82	Brexit was the most idiotic action the British stupid public made. The fact is the only people who are going to gain from brexit are a handful of tory politicians who will become multi millionaires if not billionaires leaving the EU, and a bunch of racist biggots who think leaving the EU is the same as building trumps wall at the southern border!!!! Utter nonsense based on lies and misconceptions
Comment83	A “Deal” isn’t Brexit it’s a betrayal. <br />1200 days ago we voted to leave the EU<br />What’s the point in voting?
Comment84	He&#39;s bluffing! And I&#39;m bloody good at calling out a bluff! It&#39;s all puff... it&#39;s to help force Parliament to &#39;accept&#39; the deal! I SAY CALL HIS BLUFF! WE WANT OUT WITHOUT A DEAL!!    - - - Viva La Revolución!! - - -
Comment85	Get us the fuck out of the EU. They&#39;re not so gobby now are they 😂😂😂😂
Comment86	Almost anything’s better than the evil, dangerous and silly Labour government
Comment 86.1	Fuck you&#39;re thick. 😂
Comment87	I thought they wouldn’t do another deal....so many lies upon lies....
Comment88	That old fart needs to retire but the &quot;power&quot; is like a drug to the old prick.
Comment89	&quot;I&#39;M SPEAKING!&quot; To much alcohol over the years. Good for the EU that he is leaving too .   *   *   *
Comment90	Oh. Junkers where will you find the money to get D R U N K<br />and where are the 2b Euros DEFICIT announced by the AUDITORS.. IN YOUR POCKETS.  Those are  OURS THE PEOPLE, TAX PAYERS MONEY. THIEVE&#39;S ALL OF YOU WITHOUT EXCEPTION. PAY US. BACK !!!!!!
Comment91	Now there’s a thing the wolf’s music is sweet to the ears of all who know the words?
Comment92	HA HA HA NO BENN SURRENDER ACT NOW HA HA HA. JUNKER AND THE E.U. HAVE SAID NO EXTENSION!!!! HA HA HA HA. AND IF THR REMAIN PARLIAMENT BLOCKS THIS DEAL THEN IT WILL BE AN ELECTION AND THE REMAIN PARLIAMENT WILL BE SWEPT AWAY. LABOUR LEAVE HEARTLANDS ARE ALREADY SEETHING IN ANGER WITH THEIR REMAIN TRAITOR MPs GOING AGAINST THEIR LEAVE VOTE SO BLOCKING THIS LEAVE DEAL WILL SEND THEM INTO A FRENZY OF ANGER AND THEY&#39;LL HOLD THEIR NOSES AND VOTE FOR BORIS IN DROVES. LABOUR VOTERS ALREADY DISTRUST MARXIST CORBYN SO LABOUR WILL LOSE ABOUT 60 SEATS+ TO BORIS.
Comment93	MAke no Mistake ANY deal done with the EU will favour them MORE than the UK voters
Comment 93.1	Yeah that&#39;s basic common sense. You were told that the UK won&#39;t get its own way before the referendum and you said it was fearmongering 😂
Comment 93.2	Of course.... the UK is 1/7th our size and in a weak negotiating position. What other possibility was there?
Comment94	ydaerla tixerB htiw hguone....esaelP
Comment95	Perhaps the first real signal that this agonizing parturition is almost over. No more suspense &amp; it will be deal or no deal, the final question, a grand finale with no fanfare.
Comment96	Juncker rules out Brexit extension - if Johnson can get this through parliament. And if Johnson can get this through parliament, the DUP will feel they&#39;ve been thrown under the bus. We ain&#39;t finished yet.
Comment97	The EU, have agreed the best deal that Little Britain is ever going to get, and quite correctly said that there will be no further extension. If Westminster rejects this deal, there will be no further delays, ergo No Deal scenario, this will be entirely Little Britain&#39;s fault. And the subsequent recession and all that goes alongside, job losses etc, and commodity shortages will hit Little Britain within weeks, You, no matter what you have been told of the preparation measures, your country is far from being ready for the situation that will ensue.
Comment98	Good to see leftwing snitch Matt Frei receive short shrift from Juncker. Frei is the smug Channel 4 journalist who tried to bring down UKIP and Nigel Farage over campaigning funding<br />irregularities released at the last election to inflict maximum damage.<br />High time the odious Frei was brought down a peg or two.
Comment99	THEY  should  pass  this  ,,,  its  a  Deal  means  we  can  Move  on  ,,,,,, just  Agree  the  Deal
Comment 99.1	This is perhaps the most important decision our country has had to make for generations. Why do you want to rush things?
Comment100	Now its time for the left to shoot this down. Then after brexit the UK can make a YUUUGE deal with the US
Comment 100.1	@Sauron Merciful except the US is our greatest and most important ally. Show some respect
Comment 100.2	You are an imbecile, you want a trade deal with that maniac sociopath trump who is totally unhinged!!!!
Comment101	First time in three years the BBC has shown no bias towards Brexit.
Comment 101.1	You have to wonder if the public taking things into their own hands over XR, has indicated to the BBC the way the wind is blowing. <br />ie No one pays the license fee.
Comment 101.2	@Nickle <br />No! No! He is an exiteer, will step down and be taken over by von der Leyen...
Comment 101.3	@Dugie Doogs Junker went along with the remainers. He&#39;s as much to blame as they are.
Comment 101.4	This is the first time in more than a decade when I have liked a BBC video. Even Junker was making sense, and rightly got pi$$ed off with the usual rude reporters. Deal or no deal Britain <b>must</b> finally end this divisive mess by the 31st October.
Comment102	Junker is the offspring and beneficiary of Nazis
Comment 102.1	No he&#39;s not. You must be confusing him with your grandfather.
Comment103	You people let the Germans and French overrun your country and tell YOU where to go with it. What the fuck have you done?
Comment104	Oh Sorry
Comment105	I wish our politicians would snap at the media like that, it must be so annoying being asked a question only to be constantly talked over and interrupted, never being able to answer especially if it doesn&#39;t fit the media narrative.
Comment106	Bets on next country out?
Comment 106.1	Scotland
Comment 106.2	Italy is a net contributor and yet the EU has threatened to fine them for a budget that they do not approve of and is openly hostile to the Italian governments policies on immigration control.  Shades of the UK there.
Comment107	THANK FUCK FOR THAT!!! Bored as fuck with Brexit, for the last 3 years the EU has carried on business as usual while the divided U.K festers in hate and ignorance. A broken and soon to be broke country.
Comment108	Great news

Comment115	Bout time someone told these &quot;journalists&quot; to stfu and learn some manners. They&#39;re a bunch of hyenas.
Comment116	We the majority voted in this so called democratic country, this should have been over a year ago !

Comment118	The IRA and ISIS supporter Corbyn  will not like this  agreement and will do all he can to stop it ,  as it ruins his chance to get into number 10  mind its a great chance for labour to elect  a new leader , one without communist  agenda , and thinks like normal people do.,
Comment119	The Devil is lying, they don&#39;t want Brexit at all.
Comment120	EU must be drooling AT the thought of getting UK’s taxpayers money, DREAM ON EU.
Comment121	I’m speaking 😂 true colours come shining through 🤣
Comment122	Negotiations on trade will go on for years and the news will still be full of it. <br />Your &#39;loyal&#39; fellow subjects in the north of Ireland will be like a mosquito in your bedroom. <br />The majority for an Irish border poll will steadily increase. <br />The demand for Scottish independence will continue to strengthen. <br />Wales will challenge London with ever growing confidence. <br />And if the outdated 18th century Union doesn&#39;t collapse first, in the years to come the younger &amp; more diverse generation will slowly mount a campaign to re-enter the EU, as the most ardent Brexiteers slowly leave the stage to push up daisies. <br />If you think this is the end, you&#39;re sadly even more deluded than the little Englander nationalists who thought they were still running a bloody Empire. <br />Thanks, though. There are many millions of people all over the planet who are deriving great mirth and pleasure from watching the nasty Toffs in the British ruling class tearing the whole rotten edifice down around their spoiled little public school heads. No group of people ever deserved to fail more. <br />My advice to English working class people would be to start planning a political revolution now, and finally get the rich aristocratic and royal parasites off your backs for good; they&#39;ve been holding you all back for centuries. <br />If you don&#39;t do it, they&#39;ll sell you to the highest bidder before you even know what&#39;s happening. The Shock Doctrine is coming one way or another.
Comment 122.1	You&#39;ll be welcome to what&#39;s lft of this sad country.<br />The sell-outs have sold their own kinfolk down the river and they will soon reap the rewards of inviting lazy scroungers into their land.<br />We won&#39;t get brexit, because the elite don&#39;t want it.<br />If they did they wouldn&#39;t have got us in the EU to begin with.
Comment 122.2	You&#39;ll be welcome to what&#39;s lft of this sad country.<br />The sell-outs have sold their own kinfolk down the river and they will soon reap the rewards of inviting lazy scroungers into their land.<br />We won&#39;t get brexit, because the elite don&#39;t want it.<br />If they did they wouldn&#39;t have got us in the EU to begin with.

Comment125	....more hard battle as by trafalgar...*_*
Comment126	The EU is sick and tired of this British madness and I can&#39;t blame them.
Comment 126.1	I can&#39;t blame them and I&#39;m Brittish :/
Comment 126.2	@Leeuwy  what you just said made no sense 😂😂
Comment 126.3	@Mr Dictator dude you have to stop smoking that shit.
Comment 126.4	@Mark NemesisTV oh yeah I forgot about that, you&#39;re right there, Trump is somebody you can always rely on 🤥
Comment127	I love my European friends ❤️
Comment128	No deal
Comment129	Haha, This guy didn&#39;t sleep all night day endless brexit,  and all these journalists are looking answers he can&#39;t give , ofcourse he can&#39;t say I will give you further time if you reject because 1 that will be saying I am not happy with UK brexit leaving with deal. 2 he is leaving office
Comment130	Good. I hope this makes it clear to the UK Parliament that they can not play any games hoping they can reverse Brexit. This is IT after 3+ years. Everyone has had enough.
Comment131	Chill out Juncker, you absolute freak
Comment 131.1	He&#39;s a piss artist.
Comment 131.2	True signs of the german comes out, what did you expect the Germans started two world wars z never ever trust Germans!!!
Comment 131.3	Jamie Johnson 😂😂
Comment132	we can very well hear how unprofessional most of the questions are. What&#39;s happening of schools of journalis? No wonder a tired Junker got upset.
Comment 132.1	Why he&#39;s upset ??? Maybe he. Needs his dosis with OUR MONEY
Comment133	I&#39;d be willing to bet a whole bunch of money that the trump wannabe (johnson) didn&#39;t get anything that he wanted out of this &quot;deal&quot;.<br />Just like the embarrassment in the white house, what&#39;s in the &quot;deal&quot; doesn&#39;t matter, just the fact a &quot;deal&quot; was made is good enough for that trump wannabe.<br />He tries to talk, act, and look like (notice the hair) trump.<br />I wouldn&#39;t trust &quot;Boris the trump wannabe&quot; for as far as I can spit!
Comment134	He didn&#39;t rule out an extension. He said &#39;If we have a deal there is no need for an extension.&#39;<br />He avoided talking about what happens if the deal is not passed.
Comment 134.1	@Joe Bloggs.  I am firmly in favour of leaving and would accept no deal if needs be.  But,  &#39;The Other&#39; is quite correct in what they say.  Juncker did not say no extension under any circumstances.
Comment 134.2	We end up with no deal. Fine by us.
Comment 134.3	Lol you&#39;re soooo desperate 😂😂😂
Comment135	&quot;Sky News my favourite channel!&quot;<br /><br /><br />&quot;I&#39;M SPEAKING.&quot;
Comment 135.1	@Aaron Giles Rupert.  Murdoch loves creating chaos.  It makes the morons watch breathlessly... and at their peril.
Comment 135.2	loves Sky hates channel 4.  Good man
Comment 135.3	That was channel 4 news he said that to..
Comment 135.4	For some reason Sky Australia has a pro brexit stance, don&#39;t understand the mechanics of that but there it is.
Comment136	if you cant compromise i suppose the only move left is to take over.  General election?  A possible cunning plan?
Comment137	The EU, are just covering themselves so they don&#39;t get blamed for Boris&#39;s trickery. It is virtually the same old  deal May came with months ago. Boris has no intention or interest in it at all or it actually becoming reality. He only wants to run the time out and crash with no deal. Stupid idiots are falling for it. Open your ears and listen , BORIS&quot;S DEAL IS A NO DEAL that no one even has to time to read whats in it,  people will be dummies to fall for Boris&#39;s crap trick deal to bring a crash out no deal!.
Comment138	Great news, at last Brexit will become REALITY.
Comment139	"Yes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrih0lqXVRQ&amp;t=1m51s"">1:51</a> he is so rude. Scared the hell out of the reporter.. The reporter is crying like a baby &quot;Sorry&quot;  Miyaauuunnnnnn...."
Comment140	Cette ordure d ivrogne est encore dans l Union européenne malgré qu il soit impliqué dans les réseaux gladio et bien d autres dossiers.
Comment141	If Brexit goes through, Putin will be celebrating the success of his efforts in breaking the UK away from the EU and will be working on further weakening the EU. Putin&#39;s goal is to weaken and ultimately destroy alliences in the west thus making them easier to manipulate and control by putting in his brand of leaders.
Comment 141.1	@RhondaH And Hillary Clinton is saying that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian candidate for the Democrats.<br />If Gabbard and Trump are the respective candidates for USA president in 2020. Then whoever wins will be a Russian asset. If Joe wins he will be a Ukrainian asset.
Comment 141.2	@Stuart Collins No I do not admire Putin in the least. I regret that he, together with trump, were able to scam just enough voters to get enough electoral college votes to get into the WH without getting a majority vote. I regret that the voters were unaware that so much of the crap on social media negative about Hillary Clinton was actually Russian/GOP propaganda aimed at misinforming them. I do not agree that Macron&#39;s election was a Putin success as it was his opponent who was who Putin was backing, so Putin lost that one. I do not know enough about the Israeli election to comment but the Israeli president isn&#39;t without massive problems. I am aware that Putin has a vast network of bots housed in various places in Russia and our intelligence agencies are also aware of this as well as they are aware that the U.S. is not their only target.
Comment 141.3	@RhondaH Hi As much as you might not like Putin , you have to hand it to him to be able to get his man elected to the US presidency.  I guess he also arranged for Macron to be elected French president. Not to mention the Israeli election results. You need to visit Moscow to see all the I/T  experts housed in every building and some even hiding under hotel beds doing all sorts of stuff with massive laptops.
Comment 141.4	@Stuart Collins No. It isn&#39;t. However I will say that trump is a puppet of Putin and has been doing whatever he can to appease Putin&#39;s agenda by alienating all of the U.S.&#39;s long term allies which is destroying the cohesion that previously was so valuable to the security of the western democracies. That is why Putin spent millions on polluting the social media In the U.S. with anti-Hillary Clinton propaganda and having 120+ Russian contacts with the trump campaign in 2016 in order to get his puppet into office.
Comment 141.5	Is this not what the USA  / Germany / France and UK also want to do?
Comment142	REMOANERS ON SUICIDE WATCH

Comment 144.1	Came out of nowhere, and probably shows his true character. The guy is a lowlife, just like Boris Johnson.
Comment 144.2	had he eat some kangaroo testicles like little ber-COW  ??
Comment 144.3	yeah I think he lost the plot at that point lol
Comment145	Let&#39;s see what happens when it&#39;s put to parliament on Saturday
Comment 145.1	@James Sempy <br />You do not have to.<br />It only takes a short while...<br /><br /><br />No money, no tax.
Comment 145.2	@Dutch Man <br />then , I refuse to pay taxes !!!
Comment 145.3	@James Sempy <br />No 39 bn to the EU, but a vapor of 78 bn at the FTSE
Comment 145.4	@GrrMeister <br />that&#39;s my concern as a taxpayer.<br />the deal won&#39;t pass and there will be no xtension.
Comment 145.5	<b>Foregone Conclusion - </b><b><i>EYES</i></b><b> lost it so NO DEAL - Great News and save the UK £38 Billion paid to the EU in &#39;Divorce Settlement&#39; Let us just hope.</b>
Comment146	So it falls to the tretrouse parliament... Who is the deal for... 94%of UK businesses don&#39;t trade with the EU... Public voted in a referendum to leave..... There will never be a surrender of 17.4.... Remain won by cowdice to maintain there loyalty to the bloc... And political agenda....
Comment147	We love BRITAIN &amp; EU both as intellectual people Land
Comment148	That kind of sticks the Benn act in the toilet where it belongs. Shame, the poor bumboys must be in tears. This deal or no deal, upyours.
Comment 148.1	Why do you think this affects the Benn Act?
Comment149	Basically if Parliament don&#39;t pass this deal, then no deal is their own fault. <br />If it is no deal, once trade negociations start they&#39;ll still have to find a solution to the border before anything else proceeds.
Comment 149.1	@GrrMeister That&#39;s what I said, this deal or no deal, assuming an extension isn&#39;t passed. At some point it comes down to deal or no deal. <br />If no deal, first thing the EU will need sorted in trade negociations will be the border between NI and Ireland. Nothing barring reunification changes that.
Comment 149.2	<b>You may have drunk more Whisky than me with your atrocious spelling, however I will be sober in the morning and your &#39;comment&#39; viewed as ridiculous. The Choice is DEAL OR NO DEAL can I put it simpler. Great Masterstroke from Boris.</b>
Comment150	I’m struggling here tbh🤷🏻‍♂️, they(the MP’s) trash TMay, we get Bojo, he gets another deal so we can get out of this nightmare Brexit blx, democracy chose brexit(I was a remainer 2nd a lover of democracy 1st) I accepted the majority verdict. Now I’m reading how some MP’s are trying to get this deal trashed-WTF😤. THE VOTE WAS LEAVE, stop being anti democratic, if this fails &amp; we continue with this farrago those MP’s that stop Brexit will never be trusted again, democracy in this Country will meanNOTHING.
Comment 150.1	Your words not mine. It seems very odd that I answer you then you tell me what I’m thinking. Ok, no worries.
Comment 150.2	@Robert hudson <br />So a blind zealot of democracy. You are not interested in criticism of democracy nor improving democracy. Democracy is a faith to you, not a system. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why not allow teenagers and toddlers to vote? The vote of intelligent children with an eagerness to learn are definitely worth more than the brain dead low IQ adults who will refuse to vote for a candidate, just because they saw an embarrassing photo of a candidate eating a bacon sandwich.
Comment 150.3	I’m afraid the other options of not democracy don’t interest me, I’m not a dictatorship lover. I’m not willing to consider only letting those with a high IQ or higher education vote, 1 vote for 1 person-perfect.
Comment 150.4	&quot;a lover of democracy 1st&quot;<br />Really now? Not just a blind zealot of democracy? The entire referendum was Cameron gambling with the future of the entire country to silence the euroskeptics, he put a bet on the British people wouldn&#39;t vote leave and he lost the bet. He knows that the majority of the voters don&#39;t know enough to make a vote and he doesn&#39;t care. The whole EU referendum should be considered an insult to democracy. Leaving the EU is a major decision, it is not a matter that should be resolved through a referendum in which most voters don&#39;t know enough about what they are voting for. <br /><br /><br />Stop thinking democracy is sacred and the &quot;will of the people&quot; is something special. Let&#39;s say you put all the pedophiles in the world  on an island and let them form a country, should you respect their democracy if they all vote to pass a law that let them have sex with 10 years old kids?
Comment151	So nothing has chanaged at all.<br />This happened before the EU agreed on a deal and the UK couldnt agree on it.<br /><br />EU has had the same hand for years get your shit together UK.
Comment 151.1	The problem is the politicians in the UK have not unified behind the vote. If they had this would have been sorted a long time ago. I can&#39;t help but think the UK would have had a lot more negotiating power as well...
Comment152	Greetings from Poland ✌✌✌
Comment153	He’s a nasty piece of work....
Comment 153.1	Ray Charles says guyzacunt
Comment 153.2	The whole lot are dNgerous
Comment 153.3	While you are rotten
Comment154	The big unelected what a joke
Comment 154.1	He was re-accepted by parliament 2.5 years ago.<br />Johnson was re-jected by parliament seven times...
Comment 154.2	@Ron haha
Comment 154.3	Like Johnson
Comment155	it&#39;s Boris way or no way .✌💪
Comment156	I do like Junker. He would be good in pantomime over here. There will be no hard feelings once we are free of them I don&#39;t think.
Comment 156.1	@Stephanie Tihanyi Do you mean from us? I think we might get a good result and it will be nice to put them behind us. We have our free future to look forward to and they have their problems to deal with.
Comment 156.2	Wrong! The hard feelings will not becoming from the EU.
Comment157	He ruled out a prolongation. He said nothing about an extension. Semantics rule, ok?
Comment 157.1	"Peregrine Slim what is the difference in this specific case?<br />I am googling and..<br /><br /><br />“Noun<br />(en noun)<br />The act of prolonging.<br />That which has been prolonged; an extension.”<br /><br /><a href=""https://wikidiff.com/extension/prolongation"">https://wikidiff.com/extension/prolongation</a>"
Comment 157.2	He has no power anyway. It&#39;s up to the 27 member states.
Comment158	<b>ECJ supercedes UK law, Ta&#39;ra Benn&#39;s surrender act, hello WTO 1st November.</b> 👌🏼
Comment 158.1	@DANNYBOY73 It isn&#39;t obsolete. I have explained it&#39;s purpose. The Act compels Johnson to seek an extension if a deal hasn&#39;t been agreed. No EU law prevents us from doing so. <br /><br />I think you&#39;re assuming that the Benn Act prevents a no deal, it doesn&#39;t and that wasn&#39;t its intention. <br /><br />If this deal isnt agreed then Johnson has to ask for an extension. Whether the EU agrees is a separate issue. If they don&#39;t then yes we will leave with no deal unless we agree Johnson&#39;s deal.
Comment 158.2	@Stuart Summers Asked how ministers could get round this legislation, Mr Rees-Mogg said: “The law of this land is subject to the law of the European Union, so we’ll have to see what the legal eagles think.”<br /><br />He added: “Theresa May got an extension not through UK law, but through EU law and until the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed, EU law is superior law in the UK.
Comment 158.3	@Stuart Summers The surrender act is obsolete under EU law, so we don&#39;t need to ask for any delay.
Comment 158.4	@DANNYBOY73 Yes that is pretty obvious...<br /><br />Hence the reason why we need to ask the EU for an extension if a deal isnt agreed.<br /><br />The Benn Act doesn&#39;t prevent no deal. It just requires the PM to seek an extension if a deal hasn&#39;t been accepted in parliament. So article 50 doesn&#39;t even affect the Benn Act.
Comment 158.5	@Stuart Summers The surrender act was written in UK law, article 50 is written in European law, European law supercedes UK law.
Comment159	Big up Juncker
Comment160	Haha stop interrupting 😂😂😂
Comment161	Britain no longer wants to part of the most civilised group of nations on earth. Smart move
Comment 161.1	@glyn hodges With the exception of Australia, NZ and Canada those outside the EU
Comment 161.2	Well, some say the Brexiteers are racist but listen to you!  Tell me,  who are the most uncivilized nations?
Comment 161.3	The EU =/= Europe
Comment 161.4	A group with highest unemployment levels on earth
Comment162	Very sensible of him and shows he wants to move forward in cooperation after we leave.
Comment 162.1	@Stephanie Tihanyi sounds like a remainer threat...
Comment 162.2	@Jacob Jorgenson parliament won&#39;t pass a general election so they are only delaying the inevitable. If they don&#39;t agree to this deal then no deal will happen.
Comment 162.3	there will be no unity in the UK for years.
Comment 162.4	Only, it won&#39;t pass parliament
Comment163	But if the deal does not go thru the Prime  minister must still send that letter that went thru the Scotish Courts as he agreed to abide by the law personally
Comment 163.1	Evelyn but Boris didn&#39;t say WHICH LAW
Comment164	That&#39;s not what he said, he said IF we have a deal, there&#39;s no need for an extension.<br />If either the EU or British parliament votes the deal down, then obviously there will need to be an extension.
Comment 164.1	@Nickle So. Extension has been granted. What do you have to say about that? You were so confident that the deadline wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t be extended.
Comment 164.2	@Stuart Summers Awww shucks!
Comment 164.3	@Nickle 😴 boring
Comment 164.4	@Stuart Summers You will soon be paying. Deutsche bank cut their Equities division. 50% of the entire capital spent on redundancy payments. <br />Today they announced they are axing the Interest rate division. They are going bust.
Comment 164.5	@Stuart Summers My view. They are going to stitch us up and force us to pay trillions for fuck all.
Comment165	I think the romoaners  still have one options to prevent Brexit from happening.<br /><br />They may still bring the bill before Parliament to revoke article 50 altogether.<br /><br />They brought the Ben act or the surrender bill within seven days it’s still 14 days to Brexit.
Comment166	Make no mistake about it, Theresa May could have had such a deal over a year ago. She chose not to go for it. If parliament does accept it, only time will tell whether or not she was correct.
Comment167	Jo Swinson will be squealing like a   sow
Comment 167.1	@rick Woods You really are a MASSIVE knobhead.
Comment 167.2	@Jacob Jorgenson<br />You are definitely one of these cold hearted people who hates other peoples success.. Investors from the four corners of the globe will be flooding the UK with their cash. Your heart will be breaking.<br />Jealous?<br />Oh and also you are obviously a sagging left tit. Now STFU already
Comment 167.3	@Public Public so soros and the eu funding Joe swinsons husbands company is bullshit? Pull the other one we&#39;ve been shouting out for brexit for the past 20yrs. I think the gatanteed 39billion has something to do with it, fuck all speculation needed on that money
Comment 167.4	@rick Woods &lt; brexit was funded to crash the pound to let in a million Soros&#39; from all over the world to speculate on the brexit crashed pound and asset strip the UK. The EU prohibited certain financial ploys between EU member states. The UK wont be so secure after brexit.
Comment 167.5	@rick Woods Doesn&#39;t not take much to impress MASSIVE Knobheads
Comment168	No more extension  :<br />MUSIC TO MY EARS .👍👍👍♥️
Comment 168.1	He only said there is no need of an extension since we have a deal.  If parliament votes it down then you will hear the rest of the sentence.
Comment 168.2	@Stephanie Tihanyi boring now
Comment 168.3	Stephanie Tihanyi the yellowhammer fell long time ago,stop moaning. We are leaving and you remoaners need to let it go.
Comment 168.4	short sighted remark.
Comment 168.5	that music will finish when yellowhammer falls and people become bitter and revengeful to the no deal brexiters
Comment169	How bone thick are these reporters. He said it 5 figging times. Clear out your ears. No one needs to give a flying frigg about what the UK does or dosent do. Its take the deal &amp; fuck off or dont take the deal &amp; fuck off. The EU is done being patient. Grow up &amp; make a choice. The only other alternative is revoke within the month. End of story.
Comment170	Is he drunk?
Comment171	WAIT.............. So this gets rejected, there is NO EXTENSION? Meaning a No deal Brexit????????
Comment 171.1	@Ross Leeson I found that out last night. They assume it will be voted through , but that isn&#39;t likely
Comment 171.2	Stephanie Tihanyi the people want out of the EU, deal or no deal.
Comment 171.3	No Juncker has no power. It&#39;s up to the 27 member states. He meant they do not assume it will fail in Parliament.
Comment 171.4	Good! the people do not want a no deal Brexit!
Comment172	Mr Junker what about the Hilary Ben act ???
Comment 172.1	Not his act.Benn has no say over EU
Comment173	Three years of the Labour party holding a gun to the British peoples heads , there are Many Labour voting for the Boris deal already he is finished and the Jew hate will mark him like a swastika.
Comment 173.1	Sorry that should read because there is zip.........curses to predicted scripting.
Comment 173.2	Why would the left of centre labour supporters vote Conservative ? Why do you say Corbin hates Jewish people ? You can not present any evidence at all , because their is zip.
Comment174	I&#39;m speaking.......in my outrageous frog accent you english peasant....!!!
Comment 174.1	@Denis Muthuon they dont need to ,everyone else learns English...!!  LOL
Comment 174.2	At least he is speaking a foreign language how many brits politicians can speak French? Even with a accent?
Comment175	Remoaners are now very worried they thought blocking no deal would kill off brexit but Boris might just get a deal.
Comment 175.1	Oh FFS! is the same old  deal May came with. Boris has no intention or interest in it actually getting through. He only want to run the time out and crash with no deal. Stupid idiots are falling for it.
Comment 175.2	Boris Will get the deal... the only alternative is No deal otherwise as eu wont give extension ...
Comment176	Why discuss this &#39;deal&#39;? It&#39;s got to get passed by Westminster and the EU yet!
Comment 176.1	It&#39;s not even a deal, it is still the WA. The actual deal follows….
Comment 176.2	@Carol Strachan thankyou ... From what i can gather, BJ badly needs the numbers to vote this deal on Saturday. Lack of DUP wont help 😞<br />Either way BJ is a winner tho as he&#39;s either the Brexit Hero or the Brexit Martyr
Comment 176.3	@Skylie Skye That&#39;s very helpful, thanks. Just reading up on the DUP stance. They&#39;re not happy. How much influence have they got, d&#39;you think?
Comment 176.4	Exactly. And it’s not in the interest of the EU to have a no-deal brexit. What are the oddsmakers saying about an extension....?
Comment 176.5	Yes Theresa May brought back several deals which got voted down ( by BoJo and the gang) .   BUT... this time MP&#39;s are over a barrel ... they &#39; have to &#39; vote for it or it will be No deal and out ... as EU said &quot; no extension &#39; ! So the Benn Act is obsolete...
Comment177	Boris can&#39;t deliver the parliment and there will be no extention ... wheeeee
Comment 177.1	There will be an extension. Juncker doesn&#39;t have the power to rule it out, he is a mediator he has no real power. He was just saying that the EU do not negotiate with the assumption there will be one. THEY WANT US OUT!
Comment 177.2	So they will all go for revoke
Comment178	Corbyn said no before he read the deal , just now , got him, now watch the rats jump from the ship. He will have to go down with it and his Jew hate will go with him . Corbyn has landed on the wrong side of British history.
Comment 178.1	Boris and the Tories are dead in the next election
Comment179	the pols are kicking the can down the road again ...
Comment 179.1	But this time you are in a cull de sac.
Comment 179.2	with little ber-COW inside the can .... ;-)
Comment180	C4 news being told off 😂
Comment181	Read my lips! I&#39;m lying as usual!
Comment182	Jesus H Christ, get it done already so we don’t have to hear “brexit” anymore, it’s been years.
Comment 182.1	@Peacekeeper It will be The Never Ending Story <b>cue the music</b>
Comment 182.2	@Mark H Lol That comment tickled me silly, no idea why but anyway ty :)
Comment 182.3	@uildanach2010 That is my fear also, nothing else to really add, but impossible to predict the future without hindsight, this might yet be good for us.
Comment 182.4	You realise that when it actually happens it will only be the beginning. All this wrangling has been an argument over whether or not we should <b>begin</b> Brexit. When we leave the shit will hit the fan.
Comment 182.5	@ Jason Vegan Negotiations on trade will go on for years and the news will still be full of it. <br />Your &#39;loyal&#39; fellow subjects in the north of Ireland will be like a mosquito in your bedroom. <br />The majority for an Irish border poll will steadily increase. <br />The demand for Scottish independence will continue to strengthen. <br />Wales will challenge London with ever growing confidence. <br />And if the outdated 18th century Union doesn&#39;t collapse first, in the years to come the younger &amp; more diverse generation will slowly mount a campaign to re-enter the EU, as the most ardent Brexiteers slowly leave the stage to push up daisies. <br />If you think this is the end, you&#39;re sadly even more deluded than the little Englander nationalists who thought they were still running a bloody Empire. <br />Thanks, though. There are many millions of people all over the planet who are deriving great mirth and pleasure from watching the nasty Toffs in the British ruling class tearing the whole rotten edifice down around their spoiled little public school heads. No group of people ever deserved to fail more. <br />My advice to English working class people would be to start planning a political revolution now, and finally get the rich aristocratic and royal parasites off your backs for good; they&#39;ve been holding you all back for centuries. <br />If you don&#39;t do it, they&#39;ll sell you to the highest bidder before you even know what&#39;s happening. The Shock Doctrine is coming one way or another.

Comment 183.1	@swanpride <br />Letzeberg boppe!
Comment 183.2	Are you dyslexic? Or just stupid? Anyway, I will end this here. I guess at this point everyone who is unfortunate enough to stumble over you comments will realize what kind of idiot you are
Comment 183.3	@swanpride Listen to yourself. You sound like a complete imbecile. You acknowledge that he is called Junker which is a German name and then you say he isn&#39;t called Junker which we all know he is. I think you&#39;ve forgotten to take your medication today.
Comment 183.4	@Derreck Jones Yes, Junker is a German name, but he isn&#39;t called Junker, his name is Juncker, a name which is as common in France as it is Germany. And again, it&#39;s irrelevant, because he is from Luxembourg.<br /><br />Honestly, can&#39;t you just admit that you are talking nonsense?
Comment 183.5	@swanpride Junker is a German name and it&#39;s the surname that is more important than the given names
Comment184	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrih0lqXVRQ&amp;t=1m51s"">1:51</a> - what the ......"
Comment185	The contemplation goes on
Comment186	He would KO Borris
Comment187	😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comment188	Let&#39;s not forget that he also ruled out renegotiation 4 months ago. Him saying this now does not have to mean anything at all. The member states have to agree to an extension. Sure, he is the leader of the Commission, but he cannot take this decision away from them.<br />Apart from the fact that there are still avenues for No Deal to happen should parliament agree to a deal they have no way of making any good judgement on. This won&#39;t be the end of the Brexit drama. Plus Johnson needs to amend/repeal Section 55 of the Cross-Border Trade to not break their own laws.
Comment 188.1	Yes, and the member states all love how the UK thinks they can keep this matter running forever...
Comment189	let the man speak, man!
Comment190	Here we go, NO DEAL BREXIT!
Comment 190.1	@Peter Eccleston It&#39;s incredible how many people still believe revoking Article 50 to be a genuine possibility. That ship sailed long ago.
Comment 190.2	@Peter Eccleston that wont happen.
Comment 190.3	No that means revoke art 50. Everyone knows hat this has been the plan all along, and the reason will be that the Conservative party were to blame for not getting a good deal. Even though everyone knows that the remain MP’s never wanted one. So they will vote to revoke Art 50, especially as a request for an extension will be refused now by the EU
Comment 190.4	Lets go, the chaos of division in UK is about to begin. Yellowhammer on you! Perv.
Comment 190.5	Befits your nickname...
Comment191	I hope no deal happens coz its like this deal is going to be rejected on saturday
Comment 191.1	youd be an idiot. This will pass
Comment 191.2	@The Other <br /><br />That&#39;s the way i intepreted it too. Someone in studio quickly jumped to wrong conclusion and other channels went along with that line without questioning it..
Comment 191.3	@Ged Huffadine <br />He said no extension if there is a deal. He said nothing about what happens if parliament rejects the deal or makes it conditional on a fresh referendum. The EU is never going to say you can&#39;t have an extension to have a fresh referendum.
Comment 191.4	@Ged Huffadine HE doesn&#39;t have to power to refuse it is up to the member states. He meant the EU dont negotiate with the assumption that there will be another request for an extension.
Comment 191.5	Not legally possible.
Comment192	we voted no deal, so thats what we stand by. the interview must have been early in the day, he is not drunk yet.
Comment 192.1	You voted no deal, no veal and no deer. You did vote to leave the EU - stupid enough...
Comment 192.2	No one voted &quot; no deal&quot; moron, it wasn&#39;t on the ballot papers!
Comment193	UnELECTED Guys...Telling ELECTED People What To Do! What a TRAVESTY!
Comment194	Lol..I&#39;m speaking. Really amused
Comment195	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrih0lqXVRQ&amp;t=1m50s"">1:50</a> 🤬 “I’m speaking!!” 🤬.  🤣"
Comment 195.1	The Devil showed its true face 😡
Comment196	you know who the boss was in the negotiation
Comment 196.1	Yeah of course. Boris Johnson was in charge leading negotiations.
Comment 196.2	What negotiation? This is the same deal as Theresa May
Comment 196.3	Haha, when he said &quot;I&#39;m speaking!&quot; I cowered.
Comment 196.4	The EU of course. A great deal for Ireland.
Comment197	That Jean Claude is one arrogant man 👎not a fan ....
Comment198	Juncker seems to have stitched up the remainers with &#39;no extension&#39;. If Parliament votes against the deal they will be voting against Juncker and the EU and it would seem that would lead to &#39;no deal&#39; on 31st !!
Comment 198.1	And that will be a gud thing
Comment199	As far as understand,  we lost Northern Ireland. May be I am wrong. I hope I am wrong. Our union about to collapse. I am wrong. What is our gain?
Comment 199.1	@Mike Kemble you&#39;re obviously incredibly ignorant. The 95% you are referring to was Gibraltar who voted 95% to remain in the EU.
Comment 199.2	@Mike Kemble no, that might be Gibraltar you are thinking of. We&#39;ve had two referendums in 20 years. One for GFA (70+% support), and one for brexit, where 56% voted remain. <br />Business organisations, a majority of political parties, trade Unions all like a deal where NI essentially stays in the EU rules wise. Plus GB gets brexit.
Comment 199.3	No they didn’t. Check your history mate before you make dumb unfounded comments.
Comment 199.4	@Mike Kemble total bollocks
Comment 199.5	@Brendan Coughlan NI is IRISH not British. But part of the UK. Same as Scotland, Wales and England. Our UNION.
Comment200	I am a Trump supporter
Comment201	Hopefully the Losers don&#39;t get their extension so we can leave on Oct31st and get on with it
Comment 201.1	you are a MASSIVE knobhead
Comment202	So its now coming down to Boris&#39;s crap deal, and a clean WTO deal.<br />The EU will refuse an extension, so the Surrender bill is irrelevant. <br />MPs have now a simple choice. They can&#39;t even get a VONC in time, its the last day that works, is today. Boris as 14 days post a VONC to ask for another, and that&#39;s the 31st. Try it tomorrow, too late. <br />So with the extension refused, lets see how it plays. <br />Will remainers vote for the deal, giving up all hope of a delay. Or do they vote against, with the risk the ERG, DUP wait until they are in the lobby, then join them. That kills it, and with no extension its a clean WTO set up.
Comment 202.1	@Nickle No he didn&#39;t say that was the decision of the EU27, only that if the deal is agreed there&#39;s no need for an extension.
Comment 202.2	@Stuart Summers Junker&#39;s just stated that&#39;s the decision. You&#39;ve agreed, he&#39;s not lying. So no extension.
Comment 202.3	@Stuart Summers He&#39;s just stated what the decision is. They have made the decision, no extension, and Junker is communicating it. <br />He&#39;s not made it up has he?
Comment 202.4	@Nickle I didn&#39;t say he was lying, I was simply pointing out that it&#39;s not his decision to make. He didn&#39;t say the EU27 have said there will be no extension so what he said wasn&#39;t untruthful. Merely an opinion. And as i pointed out above, he said there will be no need for an extension if the deal is agreed.
Comment 202.5	@Nickle Evidence that this is what the EU27 have already decided this?<br />Also he didn&#39;t say there would be no extension. He said there will be no need for an extension IF this deal is agreed.
Comment203	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrih0lqXVRQ&amp;t=1m51s"">1:51</a> literally scared the shit out of me. LOL"
Comment 203.1	@Profet Mohamad I wouldn&#39;t EVER fall for that trap!!! 1 diaper/nappy wouldnt be enough
Comment 203.2	Drink must be wearing off..  🍷 🤔
Comment 203.3	nadia c he’s a drunk
Comment 203.4	@nadia c more like he is drunk
Comment 203.5	Devil nearly came out of him 😂
Comment204	I’m loving the thumbnail ahahahha
Comment205	&quot;I&#39;M SPEAKING!&quot;<br />LMAO ♡♡♡
Comment 205.1	You were saying?
Comment 205.2	@Bang Bang Or the lizard lol Or maybe both.
Comment 205.3	The Devil nearly came out of him 😂
Comment206	Wow extension will be rejected. That&#39;s made the Ben act null and void
Comment 206.1	@josh cougar Wrong, it&#39;s good, serves benn and the treasonous remoaners right!
Comment 206.2	That is not what he said at all.  He was clear that there was no need to extend the leaving date if there was a deal.  He is trying to help Boris out, by not explicitily saying they would extend, but ofc they would, and that is why he couldn&#39;t say they wouldn&#39;t extend.
Comment 206.3	@mcscas68 Any extension proposed only needs to be vetoed by a single EU member state.  But Juncker does not decide that and he was careful to avoid saying that there would be no extension if parliament votes the deal down.  He only said that since we have a deal there is no need for an extension.  If it is voted down then we have no deal.
Comment 206.4	That&#39;s not what Juncker said. He said that we have deal so we don&#39;t need an extension. When asked what if Parliament would reject the deal he said that he isn&#39;t in charge of Westminster. <br />In other words: he rules it out as long as there is a deal. If Parliament rejects it, then there won&#39;t be a deal. Then the Benn Act kicks in and the PM has to request for an extension. It&#39;s up to Parliament whether there&#39;ll be a request for an extension. And only then the EU will consider whether to grant it or not.<br /><br />I finally get to understand why the negotiations were so difficult. If the UK negotiators can only hear what they want to hear, they will never be able to get what they want to get.
Comment 206.5	stuart Nicklin <br />It’s not a clean break. ‘Callable Capital’ rules apply to any deal with the EU. <br />For 12 years after we leave we are legally liable to prop up the EU’s economy if it struggles financially. Up to 500bn in that 12 year period. <br />WTO is the only clean break where  ‘Callable Capital’ no longer applies. <br />This deal leaves us with ties to the EU and if the deal is agreed that’s the easy bit done. Next is years of political declaration talks. Boris is touting it as a free trade deal but it’s only a withdrawal agreement. <br />WTO is the quickest and best solution for the U.K. Then we can jump straight into free trade talks the next day. <br />It seems the less time the EU has the better the deal.
Comment207	"@BBC News <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrih0lqXVRQ&amp;t=1m58s"">1:58</a> Imagine Junker did that to a woman, the whole main stream media would kill his career, because equality."
Comment 207.1	main stream media like BBC
Comment208	Well done for remaining sober &#39;President&#39; Junker and at 14.40 too, very impressive.
Comment 208.1	Regularly get pissed at work on taxpayer money you mean? No, I&#39;d be fired as he should.
Comment 208.2	You should try to follow his example.
Comment209	<b>*And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins,  and that ye receive not of her plagues.*</b><br />         <b>*Revelation 18:4*</b><br />              🙏❤🙏❤🙏<br />I pray for our Heavenly Father to open eyes and open ears this day
Comment 209.1	@mechamat777 just like it says on the bottom of comment~ <b>*Revelation 18:4*</b> (and i will add the KJV Holy Bible )
Comment 209.2	@Mike Kemble don&#39;t tell me what I can and cannot do....<br />Christianity is not a Religion it is Reality and in the end ever knee will bow 🙏❤🙏❤🙏
Comment 209.3	dont bring religious rubbish into politics
Comment 209.4	Where is that quote from? Sounds like a funny book, written by Monthy Python maybe?
Comment210	What a shitshow.  Brexiters have doomed the UK
Comment 210.1	@Mike Kemble Even as someone who voted Leave, I can confirm that is bollocks. Our economy wasn&#39;t booming prior to the EU at all.<br /><br />That being said, it has little relevance to the situation today. The circumstances have changed so dramatically that it&#39;s laughable to even compare then and now.
Comment 210.2	Mike Kemble Sick Man of Europe lol.  Before EU UK was in the shitter
Comment 210.3	Alex Solomon do you enjoy hurting strangers?  Does it make up for your lack of an actual life? I care more about policy that helps me than hurting others.
Comment 210.4	@Mike Kemble afraid we didn&#39;t, which is why we wanted to join. Maybe you are too young to remember and just rely on propaganda.
Comment 210.5	balls. are you old enough to remember pre EU UK - we had a great thing going, economy was booming.
Comment211	So UK government and EU agree no extension, this or it is no deal, <br />Liberal undemocrats, SNP are deluded if they think they can reverse the referendum.<br />The liberal undemocrats will make Boris win in a election coz now Boris seems more Farage than Farage himself.<br />Boris will have all Brexiteers in his pocket.
Comment 211.1	@Steve Osborne They&#39;re as bad as each other, really. Just for entirely different reasons.
Comment 211.2	More than likely it will be the hard line Brexiteers in parliament that will kill it. Just like they did with May&#39;s deal.
Comment212	Not going to lie when he snapped then I genuinely loved it even though I don’t support him and the European Union at all!
Comment 212.1	Sometimes the press think they are running the show instead of reporting on it.
Comment 212.2	T Marsh , do you support any union ?
Comment 212.3	Well it was with a little smile, but he is a extremely clever and powerful man, so don’t talk over him;)
Comment213	I&#39;m speaking ahaha
Comment 213.1	The Devil popped out for a second 😡
Comment214	That Thumbnail Though! 🤣😂🤣😂
Comment 214.1	Lol
