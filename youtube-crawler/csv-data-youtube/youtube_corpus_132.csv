Comment38	Brilliant,love you boris xx
Comment39	UK politics in irreparable mess.
Comment 39.1	Srinivas S C incompetence, corrupt, divided, deluded, snowflake generation, ex public sector , career orientated and broken
Comment 39.2	It could be repaired with ranked voting. Time for a change in the electoral system.
Comment40	They booth look like a goat 🐐
Comment41	Why are there NO SPECIFIC DETAILS about the DEAL?!???   Make it public, discuss it in public, including the FINE PRINT, and do NOT have things like Jean-Claude there “monitoring” the narrative. Just a lot of “jolly, back-slapping, back-rubbing garbage” English words.  Wake up people of Britain - do NOT go to sleep, something is NOT right here.
Comment42	The devil is in the details.
Comment43	World war three will be labour&#39;s undoing it they&#39;re all for the down fall
Comment 43.1	Conservatives fault.

Comment48	Don’t break out the Champagne bottles just yet!   I want to see what President Macron is going to do!  I want to see what the DUP is going to do!  I always thought Brexit was the big screw up show and the curtain has not been dropped to conclude the performance!  As the saying goes:  It’s not over until the fat lady sings and she hasn’t sung yet!  🇨🇦😀
Comment49	What about more funding for the armed forces and more help for people with disabilities to get a job that makes them better off and not worse off and more support for charity&#39;s and more help for veterans from the armed forces
Comment50	Brilliant to see the idiot Johnson supporters doing a volte face after not seeing him dying in a ditch.
Comment51	I remember a Prime minister, coming back from talking to Adolf Hitler. He said peace in our time. Then world war 2 broke out.  So people don’t hold your breath. Anything can happen.
Comment 51.1	Ur right
Comment 51.2	Shut the fuck up
Comment52	not a deal its a treaty we are being misled, no deal or its brexit party come the next GE
Comment 52.1	I&#39;d be worried if it wasn&#39;t a treaty. Are you stupid?
Comment53	Why do I feel we have been misled? ???
Comment54	He could get a sentence for contempt of the Scottish court he gave his word to the Judge
Comment55	Labor Party leader Communist Jeremy Corbyn, says he will vote against this new agreement 🤨<br />Corbyn is an enemy of the UK 😡
Comment56	So Boris is going against  the court again after giving his word to the court, He goes and ask the EU to agree to no extension and the Ben act was passed by parliament
Comment 56.1	Obviously you have a low IQ or are just ignorant. The BenN act said if no deal could be reached then he should write and ask for an extension. A deal has been agreed and an extension is off the table. In any case we are subject to EU law until we exit and EU law is superior to BenN&#39;s surrender act
Comment57	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAtb8Zhuo8A&amp;t=4m50s"">4:50</a> when the European Parliament looks like a Wetherspoon"
Comment58	GOD BLESS  INGLATERRA!
Comment59	BBC the great leftist media ever
Comment60	Hopefully HoC ratify this WA and UK leave on 31.10.2019 the EU. Then we get rid of Farage and his pack in Brüssel. That is the only positive side of it (at least for me)😉
Comment61	Lol, even Boris came to heel in the end. Take note, Trumpy, you&#39;re next 😉
Comment62	Bojo: &quot;Jean-Claudes the boss here&quot; SMH
Comment 62.1	@Mark Hardman And neither is Mr. Boris Bike Johnson... And busses... And bridges... And dangleways... And unaffordable housing... Actually what has Boris ever done right?
Comment 62.2	But not in the UK
Comment 62.3	Grammatical failure.
Comment63	👹👹👹👹👹👹😈😈😈😈😈😈
Comment64	I still think we will leave with no deal to be honest as Labour would never support anything a Tory does regardless of whether it is good or not. The DUP, who really cares what they think. They hold control of NI through divide and rule tactics and the people of NI deserve better. I actually hope for no deal at this stage because they never came together from day one. The people’s vote became a playing card, not a duty.
Comment65	<b>*And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.*</b><br /><b>*For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God remembered her iniquities.*</b> <br />        <b>*Revelation 18:4~5*</b><br />             🙏❤🙏❤🙏 <br />I pray for our Heavenly Father to open eyes and open ears this day, in Jesus&#39;s precious name, amen.           <br />              🙏❤🙏❤🙏
Comment66	Adieu et bon voyage cheeky fellows! Have fun you and your your British Indian commonwealth. Greetings from the civilisation. Cheeriooooo
Comment67	And I mean&#39; shit,&#39; down.
Comment68	Was that a freudian slip <br /><br />“Our money”<br /><br />Thats what has been behind these elitist motivations not whats in the best interest of the nation “money laundering” in the UK has been an contentious issue for many years and as we know putin and his oligarchs have a extensive money laundering operation one so large they have bankrupt every nation in their alliance as well as Russia<br /><br />Greed and secrecy has always been the reason for brexit<br /><br />Expect a massive economic crash sending the global markets into a further more intensive recession
Comment69	Now we can get payback on the BBC bias anti British stance they took , time to rid ourselves of the TV licence and shit down the BBC.
Comment70	He shot for the Sun and got the moon. Brilliant no extension Evan if Parliament vote against it , the art of war,  Boris brings Britain home .
Comment71	There is no way the side going to agree to this just leave no deal 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Comment72	Does this mean we avoid sinking with the EU when it eventually collapses.
Comment 72.1	@Stephanie Tihanyi Lovely.
Comment 72.2	Nah, England collapses on its own, by its own hand, because the English are simple minded idiots.
Comment73	In future, maybe it would be a better idea to have a referendum BEFORE the UK enters into any other major agreement or union - that subjugates their laws and sovereignty.
Comment74	I voted to remain but I think I&#39;m now past caring.<br /><br />My biggest issue has become listening to the BBC sowing the seeds of the americani&#39;z&#39;ation of the UK, constantly using mm/DD, expressing units of thousands as hundreds (twelve hundred).<br /><br />Very soon the NHS will be run by a country dead set against universal healthcare, there&#39;ll be more police armed with firearms and meat eaters will be eating chickens washed with bleach.<br /><br />We&#39;ve already lost Guy Fawkes Night to Halloween.
Comment 74.1	Let&#39;s all kneel in protest during &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;..
Comment75	PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.<br /><br /><br />The EU will NEVER make a good deal that will be passed by parliament.<br /><br />This is because they don&#39;t want the UK to leave the EU and are forcing the UK into a second referendum.<br /><br />The remainer MPs will stop any deals for the same reason.
Comment 75.1	I guess well see about that...
Comment76	The eu finds peace and fairness is this deal?<br />Okay brace yourself for the opposite brits!
Comment77	To all the negative armchair generals here - on one side or the other of brexit ... What of substance did you ever personally realise that has any value ?
Comment 77.1	@Bo Soerjadi no, but nice try ;-))
Comment 77.2	Does taking out the garbage count?
Comment78	*CONGRATULATIONS, BORIS AND THE U.K! GSTQ!
Comment79	Well done!
Comment80	Vote Leave!
Comment81	I would like to think the Bankers have given up trying to keep us in EU .<br />But i doubt it .
Comment82	As the train leaves the station the people are left fuming
Comment83	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAtb8Zhuo8A&amp;t=2m04s"">2:04</a> if you don’t want to sit through junkers drivel"
Comment84	The European PArliament is made of elected representants of all the countries, including the UK...it is so sad to see how stupid brexiters are...how they buy this &quot;democracy back&quot; bullshit...At least when the NI and Scotland fight to leave the UK in the near future they will be in favor of that, you know for coherence...Naah I am just kiding that will depend on what the propaganda written on a red bus tell them to do...and fake ads on Facebook too, of course
Comment85	a dreadful deal, beening sold as a great victory<br />he is takeing the country for ?
Comment86	Well that&#39;s nice so now it&#39;s just England,  Scotland and Wales whose economies will be dismantled and sold out to the American oligarchy then.  Well that&#39;s alright then.
Comment87	Jean Claude represent EU hence Britain decided to leave..the English language should be abolished..Am personally disappointed on Jean Claude not speaking in French or Germany language..
Comment 87.1	@jayukmusic If you don&#39;t know you better know it now..Chinese and French languages is dominating business cycle..Trump trades War (Tariffs) and the Brexit syndromes as change the music of colonialism ..
Comment 87.2	Tiago Rafael I doubt it. The number of English learners in China just keeps growing.
Comment 87.3	@Roy Ccc We will soon all be learning chinese instead anyway
Comment 87.4	Ireland is still part of the EU and besides English is a global language and by far more important than French and German.
Comment88	Didn’t the BBC news m sources say a deal is impossible or extremely unlikely?? I guess they talk ###
Comment 88.1	Parliament still has to vote boy!
Comment89	Very hot news
Comment90	The deal is quite fair
Comment91	UK will become a blackhole for the EU now they should just leave with no deal or not leave at all.
Comment 91.1	What do you mean?
Comment 91.2	lol - don&#39;t be a sore loser
Comment92	31 October 2019.
Comment 92.1	1/9/1939
Comment 92.2	Josie Fox who said that Northern Ireland gets to stay in the EU?
Comment 92.3	From June 23 2016 , 3 years 4 months 8 days 🙃
Comment 92.4	It&#39;s 17 October 2019.
Comment 92.5	XXXI-X-MMXIX

Comment94	Jeremy Corbyn saying London party will oppose Brexit on saturday
Comment95	"<a href=""https://youtu.be/0MxprITzlXo"">https://youtu.be/0MxprITzlXo</a>"
Comment96	If the EU concessions, the EU will be dissolved
Comment 96.1	nah the Uk is far more likely not to survive this considering how Scotland might leave with Brexit
Comment97	I do not trust this deal after glancing the doc , we will all be seeking guidance on what it summises. If there are too many concessions to the eu which May bent over then its Brexit Party all the way, so far its looking this way.     If there are any referendums , staying within the eu should not be on it.
Comment 97.1	@Goreuncle so vat isn&#39;t set by eu? So eu have no p km ans for eu army? So all the competition laws don&#39;t keep us restricted to the same eu guidelines, grow up
Comment 97.2	@rick Woods <br />The EU has no army, the EU has no control over UK (or any other member&#39;s) tax policy, the EU has no power over UK legislation.<br />Yeeeeeh, sounds like you don&#39;t know how the EU works.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, if you expect to get a fair trade deal from the Americans, you must have been born yesterday.<br />Also, if you expect any of the existing parties in the UK to give a shit about working families, you haven&#39;t understood anything.<br /><br />If you want to take back control, the first thing you must do is vote for a republic instead of a constitutional monarchy.<br />After that, dissolve the house of lords.<br />After that, eliminate the &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; voting system and replace it with a transferable vote system. <br /><br />After that, write a freaking modern constitution, including all the above changes.<br />After that, tax the bankers and corporations, so they pay their fair share and end the tax evasion epidemic<br />After that, make it illegal for banks to be bailed out using public money<br />After that, make sure to pass legislation that severely punishes companies for moving production abroad<br />etc.<br /><br />These measures will give most people some tangible control
Comment 97.3	@rick Woods Sure you didn´t...Wink Wink...Lol...I love how stupid people like you think they are part of the action...As if you are deciding something Lol So cute!
Comment 97.4	first Impression not deleted anything, i edited just like this though ! Have you found the document ? Have you seen the reams of eu acts we have to keep ?     no change to fishing , we still signing up and aiding the eu miltary , no control over taxes , no control over immigration , no control over own laws ....yeeeh sounds like Brexit     . Youre not British are you ! ergo your opinion over british matters count for shit
Comment98	Hooray ❤❤❤❤🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Comment99	&quot;Jean Claude&#39;s the boss here&quot; Freudian slip?
Comment 99.1	@Doggysoft I agree. If anything it is Boris that has the upper hand after his performance.
Comment 99.2	"<b>*HAIL BRUTUS*</b> Boris JOHNSON<br /><br />so  you have finally done it, as solidly predicted, for weeks now, <br />FORCING NEW enslaving TREATY<br /><br />for and on UK, selling down DUP, Wales and SCOTLAND,  as just pawns on your CHESSBOARD,  <br />game,  what will be lost in the <br />UK PARLIAMENT and FIRMLY REJECTED. <br /><br />So you can then play wounded BAMBI role, as the &quot;SAVER&quot; MESSIAH, who tried, but sadly olive branch you sat on, was cut underneath you.<br /><br />Why we suffered headaches 3 and half years of nightmares, BIG TOP CIRCUS performance <br />when you masterminded and agreed to 95%<br />May&#39;s deal. <br />WELL BORIS, now acting, now like NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN incarnated, looking at you, as you speak from both corners of the mouth and spitting falseness as you speak, with sugary tongue, KARMA WILL TEACH YOU BIG LESSONS, boyo...<br /><br />Were 5 minutes of ***FAME to you***, back-slapping, JUDAS kissing worthy to you to BETRAY MILLIONS of UK &amp; Northern Ireland population? Like a catfish, you swallowed  EU bait, hook, line and sinker.

SHOCKING manipulator.<br />OUR GREAT NATION ~UNITED KINGDOM,~ should be deadly worried about you at the helm<br /><br />TITANIC repeated."
Comment 99.3	He&#39;s just being respectful. More along the lines of &quot;Ladies first&quot; type mentality.
Comment100	&quot;I&#39;m happy about the deal, but I&#39;m sad about Brexit&quot; so of course to end on that the EU does not want Brexit!
Comment 100.1	@first Impression The EU does not give a shit about England, England fucked themselves, I am English, I dont give a shit about England either, well done Brexiters, you fucked our country, now you live with us. We will never forgive you. Let dis-unity reign.
Comment 100.2	&quot;The EU doesn´t want that a country that is part of the EU leave the EU&quot;....you sir &quot;is&quot; a genius...congratulations!
Comment 100.3	Obviously, why would they? It&#39;s not in their interest.
Comment 100.4	Yeah well obviously. They&#39;ve been saying that for 3 years now. How is that news
Comment101	Well done
Comment102	If the EU think it&#39;s fair, it definitely isn&#39;t.<br />What&#39;s been given up here?
Comment 102.1	@Marmelademeister We&#39;re trying to go mate, believe me. It&#39;s the traitors in our parliament that are trying to keep us in. <br /><br />Just FYI though, we don&#39;t hate Europe or European people. We hate the EU as a system. Hopefully you&#39;ll see the light too soon &lt;3
Comment 102.2	Honestly... just go and never come back! UK got special treatments all the time, more than any other country. Enough is enough.

Comment 104.1	BBC trash
Comment105	Plot twist, the democrats (just like in america) wont pass the deal cause they want globalism forever
Comment 105.1	@Morphing Jar Yes my brother the globalists are good. All they want to do is get rid of those pesky free speech rights and memes and vacuum the resourses out of each country that owns it. Why? For safe keeping ofc.
Comment 105.2	Globalism is good and we should embrace the globalists as our overlords

Comment 109.4	Jesus Christ!.......😂😆😂😆😂 Did you ever have Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn on the Jim will fix it show?
Comment110	I don’t trust the European Union at all!
Comment 110.1	BioCapsule Thank you. Exactly my thoughts. And in all those years, UK always got a milder treatment than any other country. Neither did UK contribute the most to the EU, nor the second most. At no point was UK treated unfairly by the EU. And it was not the EU that let NSA spy on UK citizens. But it seems like the minds of many UK citizens still live in the age of colonialism.
Comment 110.2	lol... you do realized that internationally, Brexit has made the UK look arrogant, incompetent and untrustworthy. The EU had been the ones being very accommodating for all of 3 years. I don&#39;t think at this point the UK gets to accuse anyone of anything.
Comment 110.3	Profet Mohamad Oh please grow up.
Comment111	His name translates to pig dick just saying
