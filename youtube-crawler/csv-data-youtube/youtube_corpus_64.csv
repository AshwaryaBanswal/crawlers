Comment1	I do not see drama on Copper YT and have no problems there so I would not call it a jungle at all! I don&#39;t twitch because, you know, some people can&#39;t even afford it. TBH it feels like, at first, we were dissapointingly ditched by you Dutch. People who did not cause drama and were learning from and also following you felt hurt. Not now, now, it&#39;s cool. Copper&#39;s place is settling, calming and everyone is respectful. So thank you. I am glad for the change for the better. Wishing you luck Dutch. Truly.
Comment2	I just watch. I said 1 thing once on twitch. I’m glad you said something Dutch
Comment3	Chat rules for $5. Should be an open forum. Earthquake forecasting a football game? Open discussion is not attacking, just proposing theories like the theme discussed.
Comment4	How do I find you on twitch. I’ve looked but all I see are cartoons or something like that
Comment5	Congratulations! You are doing the right thing. Explaining to others who have no respect. 500 Kudos to you my son.! &lt;3
Comment6	Romans 1 : 30 (KJV) Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, {inventors of evil things}, disobedient to parents,...

Comment12	YouTube jungle / electronic machetes 🤣🤣🤣👍🏼
Comment13	Thx, Copper n Dutch (and kitty!). Meh, you tube and flicker rate don&#39;t seem to bother me. It is easier to block chat on yt. So, I do. LOL ✌♥️😸
Comment14	Sooo much youtube drama and negativity this week, lots of channels hating on each other 😕 I think Dutch is right about the flicker rate as I have noticed my 11 yr old sons attitude changes dramatically after as little as 30 minutes of playing on his xbox, and he is only playing Minecraft !! I won’t let him play COD or games like that. Come to think of it, same thing happens after he has been on YouTube too
Comment15	Why don&#39;t you harshly disciple on your cats ?
Comment16	Hey bro, nice chair!
Comment17	Good
Comment18	Cool, I can blame my menopause moods on the flicker, brilliant!
Comment19	Thank you for your update @dutchsinse videos 🙏
Comment20	People off you tube should be nice .    Respectful
