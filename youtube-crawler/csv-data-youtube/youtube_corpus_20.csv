Comment 7.3	Previous month I was able to gather my first five figure wage ever!!! I&#39;ve been working for this provider on-line for 2 yrs now and I never been happier... They are paying me $95 per hour, and the best thing about that is the fact I am not really that tech-savvy, they just required standard awareness of internet and key typing skill...Great thing about this work is that now I have more time for my loved ones. I am able to commit quality time with my friends and family and look after my babies and also going on family vacation along with them very often. Don&#39;t let pass this chance and try to react rapidly. Let me show you what I do... <b>revenue39¬≠.¬≠c¬≠o¬≠m</b>
Comment8	This Documentary itself is Exploiting <br />Who&#39;s with me
Comment9	REALLY?<br /><br /><br /><br />Then why are BBC coveringup the 10&#39;000s of kids who go missing, are kidnapped &amp; trafficked from statecare &amp; killed for profit by UK establiment child grooming gangs.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />From the time since Mr&#39;s Windsor took to her throne.  Yes BBC (shame on you) for coveringup those decades of crimes that to this day, still remain injustices &lt;&lt;&lt; WESTMONSTER
Comment10	This globalist state is now worse than any Communist slum. The only thing that is keeping this from third world status is the welfare system, without that this dump would collapse. What a sad end to a once great nation.

Comment15	SIVA SIVA <br />Suffering So Bad Karma
Comment16	When kids are kidnapped from their homes because of a birth certificate registering them as owned by the government, stop listening to the propaganda, care homes make a lot of money kidnapping children do they not? so thee greed to make money is poossibly the root of this problem is it not?
Comment17	Ahhh, yes. Britain inside the EU....
Comment 17.1	that&#39;s it blame the EU, not the conservatives. same shit another day.
Comment18	Mostly white kids stolen from families to be sent out of their neighbourhoods safe or otherwise into far worse situations by Marxist council officials to be either exploited by Muslim sex slave gangs or black county line gangs. This country is being deliberately destroyed. Our people are being decimated. But I&#39;m the evil racist for pointing out the unpalatable truth.
Comment19	Whatever you do for them, they r not going to change. Can the carers or care home lock them up and not allow them to go out? No, they can‚Äôt. As soon they r out in the community they will do what they wanted to do..
