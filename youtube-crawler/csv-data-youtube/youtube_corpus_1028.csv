Comment1	The post modernists say there is no grand narative.... there is... OUR SPECIES SURVIVAL<br /><br /><br />postmodernism is just reskinned nihilism.
Comment2	ever feel like the BBC is a bastion of middle class nepotism?<br />WE have been warning about climate change for over 40 years.<br />Why is the middle class managing our entire species into the ecological abyss?<br />Maybe We don&#39;t need the worse than useless middle class any longer.
Comment3	Oh dear, 5.5k views. More people have seen my arse.

Comment5	Cliemate change ; the biggest con in modern times. ( Yes - cLIEmate change ).<br />They claim it is all &#39;man made&#39;, but cannot <b>prove</b> it, so they actually put things in place to purposely <b>create</b> flooding problems.<br />They achieve that by leaving drains blocked in vunerable places, failing to put flood defences up in time and building flood defences woefully short of what is required, thus we have roads underwater and flood walls easily breached.<br />&quot;Oh....this is so much worse than we thought!&quot; the climate shills all shout.<br />You can fool some people, but you can&#39;t fool everyone.<br />Blocking roads with middle class actors just angers people and ends up backfiring.

Comment9	Man-made climate hoax is literally causing teenage suicides
Comment 9.1	It&#39;s the ignorance of people like you which causes our entire species to suicide.
Comment 9.2	Nope I think they already had issues but it&#39;s climate hype not really climate change or something else. When you keep saying &quot;You&#39;ll die in 10 years&quot; teens can react like ... kids ?
Comment10	Utter rubbish BBC  go away  with ya propoganda bs
Comment11	How many of these Climate change warriors will make the effort to actually go out and vote?  Let&#39;s see demographics of voters and see the ages of those who vote.  It was been suggested that the vote should be extended to 16-17 year olds and stop over 75s from voting.  Apart from being undemocratic the reality is that the the percentage of those who voted would plummet.<br />The youngsters talk the talk, but, that is all they do. If they really wanted to change things they would go out in the &#39;cold and dark&#39; and vote for the parties that are taking the climate change seriously.  And before you think only the young care think on this, it is older people who recycle now we know about climate change, we aren&#39;t the ones changing our smartphones when the latest model comes out, do they know where the minerals for the batteries come from and how that impacts the local wildlife?  <br />So any youngsters reading this, recycle and stop throwing your litter everywhere, don&#39;t smoke because the biggest proportion of litter world wide is fag ends, don&#39;t believe me then just go to anywhere that smokers congregate when at work or socialise and see the mounds of fag ends, you&#39;re doing yourself a favour too.  And stop blaming us older people, we didn&#39;t know what was going on, except for the ozone layer and we did something about that and now we want to help the planet for our descendants and we&#39;ll be the ones making the effort to vote.  <br />Another reason to avoid Brexit, we will be beholden to America, which just left the Paris Accord (although, hopefully temporarily) and we know how Trump operates.  Do not vote Tory as this will be the worst thing for the environment.  I&#39;m voting Labour, I think they are the party that will realistically give us a chance to change things.
Comment12	progressive derangement syndrome
Comment13	Go away you filthy liberal.
Comment14	If I look at 11 Green MEP out of 73 UK MEP, it would seem to me that British politics would have been much greener if some form of proportional representation was implemented instead of first-passed=the-post election system that leads to so many lost votes and tactical voting.
Comment15	Its actually the &quot;democracy election&quot;.... not a brexit election, not a climate election an election for democracy itself. What type of country do you want to live in?
Comment 15.1	gilkesisking trouble is that pathetic vote is all some people have.
Comment 15.2	@Scottex1966 Then vote for democracy, not a party, not a policy, not for or against leaving the EU, democracy. If we send the message once that they can overturn a public vote and get away with it then its pretty  much all over. Forget voting for &quot;climate change action&quot; if they can get away with ignoring what you vote for. They will do what&#39;s best for those who make billions from climate destroying capitalism ( those that fund them ) and laugh at your pathetic vote.
Comment 15.3	gilkesisking an honest one.
Comment16	Climate change propaganda means nothing to most people.<br />This election is about the future of Britain and whether we accept democracy or not and democracy will win<br />ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§&gt;ðŸ’©&gt;ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º
Comment17	I want to know where the party&#39;s stand on a carbon tax and passing legislation to get manufacturers to publish publicly how to fully recycle their goods instead of leaving that responsibility on consumers
Comment18	You honestly think Bank&#39;s would be dishing out 30 year mortgages if half the planet would be under water. <br />Research the UNs Agenda 30. <br />Depopulation.
Comment19	&quot;Did you ever feel politics is just shouting and game playing&quot; YES ! And fearmongering usually about end of the world due climate change in 1 year and LGBTQXYZ rights. YES !
Comment 19.1	@Nemanja Stankovic Sorry, then I have misunderstood your sarcastic post.
Comment 19.2	@Eddy .Traarbach I was making fun of ignorant reporter , I don&#39;t discriminate people , I laugh at people trying to do stupid reports without any scientific knowledge and lacking ability to hear what they&#39;re saying.
Comment 19.3	Don&#39;t be trapped in a self fulfilling philosophy! Too many people are too easy to be fooled! And you may feel that LGBTQXYZ rights is not about you, but the truth is that discrimination can only be fought against succesfully when it&#39;s been done consistently. So allowing others to be discriminated, facilitates your discrimination!
Comment20	Climate fake scam. Let the peeps free from Roman fascist rule......clowns
