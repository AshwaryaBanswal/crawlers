Comment1	There‚Äôs so much snobbery involved in this prize it‚Äôs unreal! Glad Bernadine won and I agree with what Margaret said.

Comment4	She&#39;s black??<br />If she&#39;s black than I must be color blind!!. Ohhh and if blacks haven&#39;t win its because they haven&#39;t wrote shit till now
Comment5	Let me guess<br />Both leftist propaganda bullshit in the books..
Comment6	&quot;first black woman to win...&quot; Pray tell, how exactly can a black child come, naturally, from a white woman&#39;s womb???
Comment7	Oh the sheer futility of commenting on news articles, with a readership of 3 or 4 if you are lucky !<br /><br />It&#39;s like shouting into the wind and sleet on a late January morning at Speaker&#39;s Corner to a few cold hungry pigeons that didn&#39;t have the sense to migrate.<br /><br />And then you watch forlornly as your witty or insightful post slides down the page into the oblivion, that is, the deepest region of the page, that no one can be bothered to scroll down to. And, occasionaly revisit to see if anyone has added a like or a reply.<br /><br />How sad I, and my fellow keyboard warriors are, as a species!

Comment18	To Promote Economy <br /><br />1. Stop moving people towards luxurious life. Educate them to live a happy life.<br />2. If all people get more money from bank and they can&#39;t repay (like &#39;Chor&#39; at Oval) then bank will lose money.<br />3. One Chor 100B$ same as 100M chor 100$. To Compensate we have to ask Minimum balance from genuine people.<br />4. Teach people to work to earn money. Educate people not to spend money unnecessarily. <br />5. All countries don&#39;t have all resources. Work Unitedly for the safe growth of economy as well as safe growth of Earth for future generation.<br />6. Rapid and excess growth is called Cancer not growth. We are spoiling everything in the name technology and rapid or excess growth. <br />7. Air, Water, Food and Shelter should be basic needs. Because of Cancer our Future generation is going to work to pay this.
