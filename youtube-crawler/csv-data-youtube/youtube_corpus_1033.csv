Comment3	"Why was the interviews so short? Because BBC made it so. What was cut out of the video, that obviously was longer than 8-9 minutes? We will never know. Why did BBC film when Gorbachev had problems sitting down? To show he is (just) an old man. Some questions were leading. BBC keeps walking on a thin line of political correctness, trying to be &quot;balanced&quot;. / Torbjorn Sassersson, editor, <a href=""http://newsvoice.se/"">NewsVoice.se</a>"
Comment4	I&#39;m Australian. I am Glad I have China &amp; Russia above OZ.  Because , them mind their Own Business.  I remember the Wall coming down.  I can&#39;t believe it was 30 yrs ago. Mr Gorbachev , <b>Wonderful  Humanitarian</b>  Even Putin said , Years ago ? Comparing Russia &amp; the USA , &quot;Do I think USSR , Stalin would have Dropped Bomb on Germany , knowing that We had already defeated the Nazi&#39;s, the answer is NO.&quot;   Plus Putin said . &quot; the USA , must stop invading Places &amp; telling others how to live.&quot;

Comment12	Ah birdsh;,it head who failed to deal with the chechen ver;,min for his country! But don&#39;t worry being the Messiah doesn&#39;t stop pigeon sh;,it either. 4 times in 40 years, once as a kid, the muslim net hat my mother forced me to wear to stupid pa;,ki bas;,tard mosque saved my head 50% I reckon, one time sat outside work eating a sandwich that was a wet one and the worst, the other 2 times were dry and totally crumbled straight off and infact the last dry one was from God for me to realise that the wh;,ite people in leeds were still networking behind my back after I lost my job because of theim stalking me, they made snydie remarks and were ringing each other as I made my way from corn exchange to morrisons side ringing and laughing about a crumble of nothing! That was all because of that little wh;,ite nobody tro;,llop sophie from borders bookshop, whites were stalk:.ing the cr;,ap outta me back 10 year ago when I put christians in their place at work! I&#39;d lmfao if borders sophie had di;,ed of can;,cer sinceüòÄ would be a blissful reward but all nations of end days need to go down the plug hole &quot;he;,ll forever&quot; then I&#39;ll accept it as true bliss in totallity. God had the concentrated attention put on me from ev;,il stalking wh;,ites and then a little time later whilst they were still stalking me the sun started shining my path whilst they thought they were making fun out of me they infact were forced to witness the sun shine my path in overcast skies. As the bible also says (and every eye that pierced him will see him) Google it! It refers to me the prophesied Mahdi not to be confused with Christ. I guess it refers to both of us. You&#39;ll bu;,rn forever for what you&#39;ve been doing 10 years behind my back! I absolutely fu;,ck;,ing promise. Cant wait to be payed my kingdom by the ra;,gheads so I can get the fu;,ck outta leeds, I need to more than anything. Be so refreshing too! Fu;,ck leeds fu;,ck you your government your police and fu;,ck your ug;,ly faced whi;,te nobody royals.

Comment14	"First thing: we all agree that whatever the borders of the countries are today, WE STICK TO IT! Any attempt to disrupt this rule will be retaliated by all other countries together. When everybody is sure that the sovereignty is guaranteed, then we can get rid of nuclear weapons."
