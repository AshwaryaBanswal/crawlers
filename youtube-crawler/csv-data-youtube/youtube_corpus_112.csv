Comment17	sure. Christians will forgive those enemy. Because jesus said love your enemies. But Quran saying kill all the Christians and the Jewish people. therefore Muslims are killing people.

Comment20	On which side are you BBC?üá±üá∞
Comment21	Hasaru was born and brought up here in the island kingdom, Bahrain. His dad, Anthony, was into sales with Bahrain branch Sony outlet. His mom, late Priyanthi, was into sales with Vogue outlet here in Bahrain. They left Bahrain 5 months before this attack. Hasaru was very active in church ministries.
Comment22	Hasaru, your forgiveness is what God will bless you more and more. We really miss your mom, Priyanthi. I remember how your mother cared me while my dad passed away as she did her best to console me. She prepared food for me for all the days while dad‚Äôs body was still in mortuary while the process for repatriating the mortal remains to India were taking place. We miss your mom a lot. I was unable to believe when I came to know about your mom death. Do call me in +97339733423.
Comment23	Of course the disgusting BBC will forgive murders in the name of islam!
Comment24	"<a href=""https://youtu.be/9B0XQJadXDI"">https://youtu.be/9B0XQJadXDI</a>"
Comment25	Can not forgive..just hang..i dont like islam
Comment26	This is all due to Arabisation and Islamisation. Saudi Arabia is funding Arabic schools, madrasas (Islamic schools) and mosques to push ultraconservative Wahhabism onto Muslim communities all over the world. Muslim communities in South and Southeast Asian countries are becoming Arabisised and Islamisised by adopting Arabic/Middle Eastern interpretations of Islam which clash with the local S &amp; SE Asian cultures. It&#39;s an issue in many S &amp; SE Asian countries today, like Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Thailand and even in Muslim-majority Malaysia. I don&#39;t care if people are offended by this but Middle Eastern interpretations of Islam should remain in the Middle East. There is a serious culture clash in S &amp; SE Asian countries these days due to foreign Arabic cultural beliefs that have no place in Asia-Pacific countries.
Comment27	Aren&#39;t there some Buddhists monks there that call for violence against some members of the Muslim community? And the monks want to come off as being all loving do no harm to any living thing. Most of them are just plain hypocrites.I&#39;ve been there and see how some members society treat each other.
Comment 27.1	Pathetic man, people are suffers from ethical slamic extremist all over the world, but Sri Lanka is very peaceful country, after the this bombed insident no Muslim got hurt or attacked that the way in buddism behave well they are guided well by the &quot;dumma&quot; don&#39;t spread lies upon our shoulders, then if you are for sure you not different than this bomb attacker.
Comment 27.2	Those aren&#39;t real monks, they&#39;re right wing ethnic nationalists. A real monk won&#39;t behave like that and in theory can&#39;t behave like that. You want to see what a real monk is then travel to the countryside of any Asian country (Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia etc.) and you&#39;ll find the real monk. Just because those people are wearing monk robes does not mean they are real monks. They&#39;re part of a right wing ethnic nationalist organisation. You should read more about the rise in ethnic nationalism in South and Southeast Asian countries. I suggest reading Asian sources, such as Singapore&#39;s The Straits Times or Japan&#39;s Nikkei Asian Review, because this is an Asian issue and I&#39;ve noticed many European, American and Canadian outlets are publishing lies about what&#39;s happening in Asian countries.
Comment28	The first ever government sponsored Islamic attack
Comment29	Only the weak will forgive.
Comment30	Me and my wife were there when it happened. We will forever cherish the smiles, humility, resilience and honesty of the Sri Lankan people. We well come back.

Comment32	muslims did this. Never forgive, never forget.
Comment 32.1	John Msx Until 20 years ago that‚Äôs when your bullshit started. Get your hands out of our countries and politics and maybe your streets wouldn‚Äôt look like war zones. Get your ass out of your head. I bet you There‚Äôd be no such thing as Islamic extremism if you just didn‚Äôt meddle with foreign nations. No wonder why 9/11 happened and your soldiers return with their legs blown off.
Comment 32.2	@M.HDoes it say you can do it in the koran?
Comment 32.3	@Lawless Nation You&#39;re the ignorant one. Until 20 years ago the only people who had a problem with muslims were the Jews, not we all hate you enough to do things like that, and you&#39;re the only ones to blame for it.
Comment 32.4	John Msx Stfu If they can do that in New Zealand who says we can‚Äôt do it?

Comment38	Should the Muslim who killed gay people be forgiven bbc? Do a video on that Bbcnews.
Comment39	We forgive but not forget.  Forgiveness is not memory loss. I pray against Allah the evel power mohomad fabricated. I exercise dominion over Allah mohomad and Islam I take authority over Allah mohomad and Islam and I bind you Allah mohomad and Islam in hell in the mighty name of Jesus the son of God amen Allah is not the God of Israel
Comment40	Why did they look so happy? The old lady was smiling.
Comment 40.1	Sometimes smiling is better than crying
Comment 40.2	It&#39;s a nervous smile. Read the subtitles and understand what she&#39;s saying when she begins to smile.
Comment41	Christians, and Muslims, are two words missing from the biased Broadcasting co these days..
Comment42	No mention that the bomber was an Islamic Radical!
Comment 42.1	Robbie Craughwell Lol I‚Äôm a Muslim and I‚Äôm not sorry about what happened there tbh. Just revenge is dish best served cold. New Zealand = Sri Lanka üòè

Comment 42.4	It&#39;s the BBC, They only consider the perpetrators terrorists if they kill white people.. Massacres of others are considered done by &quot;rebels&quot;
Comment 42.5	They were
Comment43	God doesn‚Äôt allow forgiveness of this level of crime. What a stupid video title.
Comment 43.1	@aN-t0z well said
Comment 43.2	Anne Lane Well it really depends. The bomber was brainwashed and just misled so badly. Like in the video, they&#39;re right, I really forgive the bomber but not the ones that trained them. It&#39;s hard to think that they are still out there. There are people like me that fogave and many that didn&#39;t.
Comment44	Once religion is scribed the extremist interpretation it becomes a Lethal instrument, organised religion sometimes is causing misery
Comment45	Iam TAMILAN, <br /><br />Nadakura sambavam lam roamba varuthama irukku, enakku srilanka laum nanbargal irukanga, roamba mosamana oru vishayam srilanka makkalukku nadanthurukku, <br /><br />But What is the connection between NZ shooter and SL bomber, aduthu aduthu nadanthathunaala idhula yaarukkum santheagam varaliya, <br /><br />Nowadays religions are becoming a tool to spoil the unity among the people, it&#39;s like lions hunting, Who are the peoples doing like this, is there any investigation happened related to this, <br /><br />Religious clash happens all over the world, why??<br /><br />I always say that &quot;Anaithu madhathukkum madham undu adhan peyar MANITHAM ‚õ™üïâüïã&quot; ( every religion has a religion and the name is HUMANITY,)
Comment46	"&amp; what are Christians doing to the world? Isn&#39;t brainwashing people with Christianity a crime against HUMANITY? Mormons are basically the global KKK <a href=""https://youtu.be/n3BqLZ8UoZk"">https://youtu.be/n3BqLZ8UoZk</a>"
Comment47	Jesus once said forgive them for they know not what they do, he didn&#39;t say forgive them if they know what they do,
Comment 47.1	Well,these evil men following evil teachings thought they knew what they did when in actual fact they did not know just like those who crucified JESUS CHRIST
Comment48	Why has my comment <br />been removed

Comment52	This is a Christianophobic terrorist attack. A hate crime against Christians.
Comment 52.1	@Mahir Hussam @Mahir Hussain, the whole world know your faith woman are meant to keep as a human production factory. Your brotherhood men intentionally use &quot;Love Jihad&quot; on Christian and Jewish women. Your Mulla&#39;s know to preach violence (never to bow down and always rebellious ) on Friday meetings. Why do you explode bombs on Fridays after meetings ?
Comment 52.2	@Mahir Hussam What the f is in your verses? Tear of the page which ask your people to eliminate those who don&#39;t follow your faith. <br />Instead of arguing here, go find your fanatics not to say &#39;allahu akbar&#39; and not to explode. Why your brothers are using your alla name before killing innocent.  Shame and ruthless animals you are .
Comment 52.3	@Oracle Team 1 wtf?

Comment 56.1	@Mohamed Saheed your Allah only provocated to kill people you can&#39;t lie to a person who read quran.  Your Allah is not our God the God of Israel  your Allah is in hell
Comment 56.2	Mohamed Saheed   They defamed the name of Islam and gave millions of peace loving Muslims bad stereotype names. .Heretics abandon their true faith for their own ends just like the Christian Crusaders hundreds of years ago when they went  to Jerusalem killing and beheading<br />TheChristian Pope at the time branded these guys heretics which means has betrayed your own leader  for us that was Jesus  and for Muslims the Prophet Mohammed they betrayed their own prophets teaching . if you coerce somone into believing or kill them because they don‚Äôt want to believe. You yourself should forfeit your life end of story üá¨üáßüá∫üá∏ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíî
Comment 56.3	How can you give death penalty to suicide bombers. Only God can punish them in hell.

Comment63	Why would you forgive these sadistic ba*tards. They did this for one reason only, hate.  If they survived, would I execute them, no, I would not. They‚Äôd be sent to the worst sh*thole prison for the rest of their lives. I wouldn‚Äôt make them martyrs for others of their ilk to praise and emulate.
Comment 63.1	I forgave the bomber and that&#39;s it. He was brainwashed religion-wise. I chose to forgive but not forget.
Comment64	In Islam our Prophet PBUH forbade us from destroying churches so I think that this is not done by Muslims.
Comment65	THIS IS HOW  &quot; RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING WORKS &quot;  !   another  mind-less act , by a  MIND-LESS MINION who STOPPED THINKING FOR HIM-SELF , he STOPPED using basic common sense AND  missed the boat with  any ACTIVE MORALS , he was MORALLY BANKRUPT many would say.<br />  Also !     then to start LISTENING &amp; BELIEVING to all those corporate PAID-LIPS , those   &quot; DAILY FAKE NEWS OUTLETS &quot; ,  those  CREATORS  of all that CRAP &amp;  ALL THAT FANTASY !<br />  I think  YOU MIGHT KNOW THEM  !

Comment 66.1	Kapten Krok Well yeah mate. Don‚Äôt you remember what happened in Christchurch? It‚Äôs just payback for that.
Comment 66.2	Because in religion places people are busy with prayer and can&#39;t do much to protect themselves
Comment 66.3	Airport Documentaries and these radical idiots fall for it. When someone‚Äôs commits a terror attack, another idiot tries to seek revenge by killing innocent people.
Comment 66.4	This is what the elite want. War is good for the elite.
Comment67	Ah yes, the attack on &quot;Easter Worshippers&quot;, the one where the bombers sought out the Sunday school group of children and went boom when they got next to them.
Comment 67.1	@Marina <br />NOPE...IT WAS EVIL SATANIC MEN WHO ATTACKED FELLOW HUMANS.
Comment 67.2	@M.H The Christchurch massacre was a revenge attack, you prick.
Comment 67.3	Marina Same with Christchurch dear. Really couldn‚Äôt care. Revenge is great.

Any non-Muslim action offends Islam and result in uprising e.g  India, RUS<br />20-40% Jihad, Riot, Church burning e.g Ethiopia, Bosnia<br />Over 60% Persecution of all other religions with Sharia as weapon e.g Sudan, Syria<br />95-100% There‚Äôs supposed to be peace. But Muslims kill less radical Muslims for a variety of reasons e.g Afg, Pak, Somalia, Libya"
Comment71	Hope they nuke this P.O.S 3RD WORLD COUNTRY

Comment 72.1	Thats not true i reads 6 religion books from different religions .islam is good and tech people how to live in peace but some born islamic leader and greedy people misuse religion to achieve their target
Comment 72.2	You see what media shows you<br />Killing humans is the biggest crime in Islam <br />Go grab some knowledge idiot
Comment73	islam is a religion which legalizes, child marriage, wife-beating, incest. Along with killing of atheist/ex-muslims/LGBTQ, male and female genital mutilation, with no freedom of speech, expression and movement.
Comment74	Why are they worshipping &#39; white Jesus &#39; ?
Comment75	Nobody is going to forgive bbc for this show
Comment 75.1	Another dumb video by BBC. They wouldn&#39;t be making this if this happened in UK. <br /><br />In another news, William and Kate were in Pakistan last week dressed in all green. Not reported by BBC. Perhaps this video is just what it is, catering to a certain religion.
Comment 75.2	Thanks be to God for that.
Comment76	Islam is the devils religion .
Comment77	If white Christians did this the BBC would call for their heads.
Comment 77.1	@Jimi Mased he was athiest
Comment 77.2	white Christians did in NZ, where&#39;s the call you refer to
Comment 77.3	Mr Heidelberg <br />Not only do we need to call for their heads, we should find out who really is funding these type of people to dilute her their political gains and demonise another community.
Comment78	God will never forgive you BBC .
Comment79	One wonders why this atrocity got about 1% of the coverage of that which happened in Christchurch. Then one remembers the BBC couldn&#39;t link it to the far right or Donald Trump no matter how hard they tried. And people tried so hard to link the two. I think Trump posted a &quot;racist&quot; tweet that got a lot more traffic. So they ran with that, because it fitted their false narrative.
Comment80	Fuk you siri lanka muslim people
Comment 80.1	We Christians must stick together against the devil religion calling Islam .
Comment81	Internal politics pave a path for terrorists, in Srilanka its proved once again
Comment82	Looks identical to the Boston marathon bombing.... show a guy wearing a backpack, show a guy entering a building wearing a backpack, DONT show the backpack blow up and claim the explosion came from a guy wearing a backpack........ why not cut the file AFTER the backpack blows up?!?!?! Nahhhhh that would be proof that the guy wearing that backpack actually was the cause of the explosion. ü§î shitty re-run of a bad movie!!!!
Comment 82.1	Senali Karunathilake they don‚Äôt show where the explosion came from, they show an explosion yes, but they always stop the film before the pack even starts smoke, don‚Äôt show the carnage but show the backpack igniting is all I‚Äôm saying, they did this same camera switching and same cctv type for they Boston Marathon bombing same exact screen play
Comment 82.2	There were footage of the bombers wearing backbacks, watch the cctv footage shown in local news station. Bbc had always shown propaganda against sl people.
Comment83	"There may seem weird or can&#39;t understand why the person who was being interviewed was talking about forgiving. <br />The reason behind it is the uniqueness and beautiful of Christianity. In one of the Bible verse says this. <br />Colossians <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_324vJYKNlo&amp;t=3m13s"">3:13</a>, NIV: &quot;Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone.

Comment 84.1	@Airport Documentaries yeah man that all was settled<br />But dumb Americans never get this
Comment 84.2	Airport Documentaries this one was also done by bush, now suck it !
Comment 84.3	Bush did 9/11 now suck it
Comment85	It‚Äôs so funny that destroyed their homeland ,making themselves become the bombers ,then you say Jesus forgive them please! just like a shit!
Comment86	This is the works of Devils, Islamic devils, Islamic evil. With the blood of innocence on his hands, i am sure he has met Muhammad in hell. A curse be upon him
Comment 86.1	@Ghost Rider you are a blinded and do not understand logic. Thank your parents and the dictatorial Islamic tradition, which doesn&#39;t allow you to make a choice
Comment 86.2	@Ghost Rider Read quran and discover what moh mad did
Comment 86.3	@Ghost Rider  - seeing that my previous reply to you was probably removed by BBC censors, in their despicable effort to protect the image of islam for some odd reason. <br />This time i&#39;ll simply say this, which is merely a reiteration condensed. It is this...................<br />WE HAVE 1400 YEARS OF ISLAMIC HISTORY THAT TELLS US OTHERWISE.
Comment 86.4	Yes
Comment 86.5	A few terrorists don&#39;t represent the entire religion.
Comment87	God will never firgive bbc and all other social medias for turnin people againist each other .
Comment88	Bombers should face death sentence! Who agrees?  üî• üåπ üëç
Comment 88.1	Yeah but our politicians don&#39;t understand that.  It was ourlivie it was a huge lost for us. But this loss isn&#39;t that big for our politicians only it does matter for commoners.
Comment 88.2	@Angelo Dunno What is wrong with you? Why on earth are you trying to defend those suicide bombers? You&#39;re sick. Asian countries have had enough of this Islamist nonsense so don&#39;t try and defend the actions of terrorists.
Comment 88.3	These Jihadis are already dead!!<br /><br /><br />Must be enjoying 72 hoors in hell Lol
Comment 88.4	Zepher Gaming maybe real people don‚Äôt believe anyone or any COMPANY that continually lies and gets caught lying... you are correct not every story is a conspiracy but on the other side of that coin there actually is real conspiracies.... and if I were to look for a conspiracy, I‚Äôd be looking at the known liars..... as long as you make excuses for groups like the msm they will never need real reporting...
Comment 88.5	Angelo Dunno Not everything is a conspiracy dude, the BBC would not be able to broadcast that footage. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be able to find it on the internet somewhere. Bro I literally witnessed a terror attack and on twitter and YouTube later on people were saying oohhh it didn‚Äôt really happen it was staged. You have to be able to decipher the bullshit on this occasion you got it wrong my friend
Comment89	May God bless you brothers. Almighty may Save you from inhumanely terrorist. You may kill Christian but never kill the religion of Christian. Christian means to spread love to the world and cherish any.

Nahhhhh that would be proof that the guy wearing that backpack actually was the cause of the explosion. ü§î shitty re-run of a bad movie!!!!
Comment93	Hate and resentment is swallowing poison and expecting it to hurt ur enemy. Once u realize that the only thing stopping you from moving on is the decision to accept, forgive and move on, you will always be trapped. Dont let a single day define your life

Comment96	they keep bombing and you keep forgiving , nothing gonna change itself IF you don&#39;t change it , or at least try to , even pretend to do so
Comment 96.1	ZuboyTV of course u can&#39;t blame the government alone, but I&#39;m just saying it could&#39;ve been avoided.
Comment 96.2	@aN-t0z fine but sometimes it&#39;s not govt fault if seeds are planted by someone else
Comment 96.3	ZuboyTV Its really just the government. Due to the lack of responsibility, there was an open door. It sucks manüòï
Comment97	There&#39;s a reason more wars have waged over religion/ideology in the history of mankind than anything else....its a easy step to the mental illness of &quot;my way is the only truth, we must attack the nonbelievers/&quot;others&quot;...extremeism is the poison, the cure is to break the cycle and reach out to the disenfranchised and the ones that feel like society/a community etc has failed them in some way...it only takes them having one friend to help them say &quot;well not all of them are bad, this thing I&#39;ve been told is a lie, you can&#39;t judge everyone in any group&quot; And that&#39;s how you get them to hopefully turn in their extremist comrades before they can do harm and turn their own lives around into something filled with love and acceptance instead of hate and ignorance
Comment98	BBC will never be forgiven, for coveringup UK establiment child grooming gangs <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A shame on BBC for hiding behind the official secrets act to coverup those injustices &lt;&lt;&lt; WESTMONSTER

Comment 99.5	If we all hold the hate and resentment in our hearts, go out seeking revenge, then someone else will come seeking revenge, it is a circle and it must be stopped. Anyone who facilitated the terrorists should be given life in prison under isolation.

Comment 102.1	@Elizabeth Francis for u people may be ,not everyone.they were killed becoz they are believers of almighty jesus christ.jesus teachings helps me alot
Comment 102.2	Forgiveness is a command for the benefit of the soul because if you keep grudge your soul becomes dirty and it affects the relationship between you and God I mean Yahwy the God of Israel not Allah. but Jesus told us to pray for your enemies. But Jesus did not give a PRAYERPOINT. You may choose I pray to my father God through christ Jesus  That the Judgement of God be upon them psalm 94/1 Oh God to whom the vengeance belong show thyself.
Comment 102.3	Religious zealots aren&#39;t really different from one another,they are just different shades of retarded. One might blow himself up to appease a mythical man in the sky and another would gladly stand in front of said man hoping to be caught in the blast to appease a mythical yet slightly different man in the sky.

Comment111	But British are thieves and Invaders...<br />British <br />The most shameless people on the planet<br /><br />How African Slavery Civilized Britain<br />Over the course of three centuries, Britain became the largest slaving nation in the world and the slave trade grew to become Britain‚Äôs largest and most profitable industry. Britain generated an estimated equivalent of four trillion pounds on the unpaid labour of slaves.<br /><br />Britain owes its very existence as a first world nation to the African slave trade. Great Britain‚Äôs economic way of life was formed by slavery: about it revolved, and on it depended, most of Britain‚Äôs other industries.
Comment 111.1	@Sayak Ghosh absolutely can&#39;t deny these things on UK they truly respect freedom of speech , they give chances to every races  in there community like sports , politics for ex. what they did in past that cannot be forgiven may be , but they actually giving chances to every community to speak to live with there own identities . indians celebrates independence day in UK and they have no problem from that j. ust  think supporting any country from south east countries and you will be targeted as anti-national ,terrorist  &amp; gaddar.
Comment 111.2	@Love love 822 I didn&#39;t say that British were right, I said,  they had a plan to fulfill their dreams,  they worked hard and succeeded.  And inflicted many cruelties on natives.  My point is they had reassessed themselves and have progressed.  So can we.  Eg: Be a person of color in UK and you get right to talk about British cruelties ,  do same in some Asian/African country,  probably you will just vanish
Comment 111.3	@Sayak Ghosh they never complained or asked for British help,they should&#39;ve left them in the mud houses or in their leather clothes n eating wild food,tht was thier way of life. They were happy until the Western world invaded Africa,thts wen all this problems started.....
Comment 111.4	Yes,  They were powerful.  It was an urge to fight their poverty and they developed a scientific temperament to achieve it.  Of course they had done many cruelties but you can see how they have over decades developed themselves in a better way, ex.  Today I can go to work in UK,  after 7-10 years get citizenship.  I can also practice my religion. Can we do same in some Asian country?  Most Asian country are still very fundamentalist in nature. We have to move ahead,  develop a better sense of love and compassion.
Comment112	He wasn&#39;t an &quot;extremist&quot;, he was your typical, everyday muslim.  He was doing exactly what the koran tells every muslim they must do.  Anyone with a brain knows that.
Comment 112.1	‚Äã@Imam scriptures of all religion contain a lot of verses that can be interpreted differently by its followers, with good or bad intent. But why there are more follower from Islam who tend to skew the meaning of a verse towards doing evil to others more than other religion? I tend to believe there is something wrong with the teaching that causes a society towards extremism and poverty.. It started with golden age of Islam but the success decline and the people become mostly degenerate and uncivilized due to extremism. Like what happened in Pakistan and Afghanistan..I don‚Äôt know what went wrong with it but I hope it will become better in the future..
Comment 112.2	Islam is the most vile religion on the face of the Earth. Look at what their prophet said about Christians!<br /><br />The Promise to St. Catherine: ‚ÄúThis is a message from Muhammad ibn Abdullah, as a covenant to those who adopt Christianity, near and far, we are with them. Verily I, the servants, the helpers, and my followers defend them, because Christians are my citizens; and by Allah! I hold out against anything that displeases them. No compulsion is to be on them. Neither are their judges to be removed from their jobs nor their monks from their monasteries. No one is to destroy a house of their religion, to damage it, or to carry anything from it to the Muslims‚Äô houses. Should anyone take any of these, he would spoil God‚Äôs covenant and disobey His Prophet. Verily, they are my allies and have my secure charter against all that they hate. No one is to force them to travel or to oblige them to fight. The Muslims are to fight for them. If a female Christian is married to a Muslim, it is not to take place without her approval. She is not to be prevented from visiting her church to pray. Their churches are to be respected. They are neither to be prevented from repairing them nor the sacredness of their covenants. No one of the nation (Muslims) is to disobey the covenant till the Last Day (end of the world).‚Äù
Comment 112.3	"The BBC would like to announce that you, sir, are an islamophobic bigot.<br /><br />All they want you to do is racemix and import a defective group of human beings, what could be the harm in that? I mean it seems to be going well in France, they&#39;ve only murdered some odd thousand people and set a few hundred churches ablaze including the Notre Dame. You&#39;re just misunderstanding them!"
Comment113	God only knows who were behind this attack,  people across the world are massacre by playing hidden politics. <br />For trapping,  defaming some groups others playing foul to gain political achievement.
Comment 113.1	Islam Nazi Pakistan
Comment 113.2	Pakistani
Comment 113.3	It was proved. Drug gangs are responsible.  But the truth is suppressed
Comment114	There are people you can reason with, who will regret their actions, then there are terrorists who you can&#39;t reason with, who don&#39;t regret their actions, they only understand the language of the sword. Forgiveness would only encourage them to do more.
Comment 114.1	My problem is not Islam but radical Muslims. See,  I will tell from Indian context.  I&#39;m a Hindu and we also have many corrupt practices. Like windows were not allowed to remarry and caste system.  Eventually many Hindus like Vidyasagar, RamMohan Roy,  Jyotibha Phuley,  Swami Vivekananda etc.  tried hard to eradicate these corruptions. Today,  we are a little ahead.  Still a long way to go.  Muslims also need great leaders who will take pains to revive the religion.
Comment115	But I still have that terrible thing in my mind also can‚Äôt forget that terrible attack for Christian and whole Sri Lanka also tourism and more industries, That pain is still never went also in future. April 21st. R.I.P that who‚Äôs face to that situation. üòìüòìüòîüôèüèº

Comment 119.2	@Jay <br />We&#39;re pushovers... yet it&#39;s the Christian countries that rule the world.<br />We forgive, after we&#39;ve whooped your ass!
Comment 119.3	christians are pushovers because Hebrews changed a lot of the scripture centuries ago.. Forgiving terrorists isn&#39;t a productive way to deal with anything, you&#39;re just inviting them to attack you more.
Comment120	You have to be a disgusting person to do what those men did. You have to be compassionate and smart to have the forgiving attitude these people have. Rest in peace to everyone who was hurt and lost loved ones. People lost their children, parents, siblings, grandparents and friends. I‚Äôm so sorry you guys experienced this. The extremists win when we get scared. We will defeat extremism through education and unity. Love and peace ‚ù§Ô∏è
Comment 120.1	Hasaru is a humble boy ever since I know him, since his birth. However, as a small kid, just about to walk, he used to pull down all the things whichever I keep it safe. üòÇ As he grew up, he is humble and serve the church service during weekends and never he get into arguments with any other kids.

Comment 125.2	@Zepher Gaming in my opinion Socialism is just Communism with patience. I&#39;m not a big  fan of any UK party, it&#39;s more the lesser of two evils
Comment 125.3	free Baluchistan, free sindh,free Tibet Shut up you fool, go celebrate the fact you‚Äôve got toilets.
Comment 125.4	stop Mass Hysteria No they wouldn‚Äôt, if you actually think that the BBC hasn‚Äôt tried to smear Jeremy Corbyn more than any other political figure over the past 20 years your crazy.
Comment 125.5	Jay You should always forgive, but you should never forget. You forgive so that you yourself don‚Äôt carry hate in your heart for as long as you live, you never forget so that you hold that person to account. Carrying hate will not solve the problem but only bring new problems.
