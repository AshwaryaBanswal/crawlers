Comment15	Parliamant Must Responsibilities About Black Road To Leave Brexit Deal, .... God Bless All, ...... Cheerio.🌠👍👍👍🌠🌟🌠.
Comment16	This ceremonial pomp is a bit cringe for the 21st century it’s like a silly school play.
Comment 16.1	It’s tradition. It’s what makes a culture. When we lose tradition, we lose a part of our past.
Comment17	suddenly iam reminded of all the English dramas i have seen and acted in my school and college days.
Comment18	&quot;Mr. director, the queen commands this ridiculous circus with it&#39;s head clown Boris Johnson to perform in the fancy room!&quot;
Comment19	I wish she may grant me a British citizenship
Comment20	What  a stupid tradicion!
Comment 20.1	Is it? All the parliaments that the UK left behind made some of the most successful countries in the world. The UK has just had a few hundred extra years of tradition that has stood the test of time. How many other countries have proceedings like this? Maybe a few copycats.
Comment21	Dats my Koh-i-Noor gimme back!!!!!!

Comment22	Give us back our Kohinoor, Thief Queen
Comment23	Black Rod sounds racist to me!  Love Dianne Abbott

Comment 24.3	You think they are all actors???
Comment25	This is beauty
Comment26	Authority of the House of Commons? Over the Queen?

Comment33	It&#39;s all cringey as fuck the lot of it... Jesus christ!
Comment34	Is this a joke? 2019. It&#39;s just a tad more ridiculous than if it were real.
Comment 34.1	@Lummy62 In 2019 you must have heard of &quot;divide and rule&quot; unsuccessful nations.  Yup those DIAMONDS are from Africa, and those expensive cars OIL from the Middle East.  Those poorly run nations leaders are bribed or replaced with force, so that the western LOOTING can happen.<br />You&#39;re in 22 countries as we speak and America &#39;s righthand man in all the wars.  As for your history, I wouldn&#39;t go there if I were you. <br />Anyway, this charade is still hilariously ridiculous in 2019.
Comment 34.2	@world peace learn some history, mainly of other unsuccessful nations. Secondly, how do you propose to end homelessness and famine when there&#39;s too many people in poorly run nations? If it was all so easy it would of been achieved by now. If you&#39;re not happy, then go and become an aid worker or something and make a difference instead of moaning.
Comment 34.3	@charlesdcw1990 I think all of you are still under that rock.<br />It&#39;s where the colonial stolen treasures from the world are.<br />All the pretentious grandeur when so many of your people are homeless and starving.  Really??<br />It&#39;s almost comical in 2019. <br />Stuck in a time-zone.
Comment 34.4	Every country has their traditions. Go crawl under a rock and stay there.
Comment35	I was waiting for the remark from Dennis Skinner! 😂 He&#39;s the only reason I watch these lol

Comment 39.1	Lummy62  it’s not 1920 anymore
Comment 39.2	@Lummy62 absolutely !
Comment 39.3	Of course, look how small the UK is, then take a look at it&#39;s imprint all over the world, through conquest and science. I think you&#39;re the one who&#39;s the joke and doesn&#39;t know it. Hahaha!
Comment 39.4	To whom? The Europe? Well, quite a few of them are monarchy too. The US? Well Lizzy is better than a large infalted orange ballon, grabbing women by their pussies, masquerading as a Head of State.
Comment40	🇦🇿

Comment45	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZlbVvTC6Jw&amp;t=4m23s"">4:23</a> Trick or treat"
Comment46	The Good people of the world can see how this evil people are. Queen Elizabeth of England and British government the blood of innocent people of biafra is crying in your hand. do you see your spech that UK will leave EU but you backing Nigeria government to kill Christian biafra. which you know that they have do to be free from Nigeria. British should be sincere with themselves. The biafra life matter how can British will be destroying the life of innocent Christian biafra because of British selfish interest in Nigeria.
Comment47	The Queen&#39;s speech was so cool. She give all the remoaners a spanking. And ordered Brexit take place on 31 October. And the EU  told the remoaners &quot; no more extensions &quot;  That&#39;s a pretty good few days I would think.
Comment48	This is real? Erm! More like  A FILM!!
Comment 48.1	Greavesy well i mean there is<br />but there&#39;s no such thing as royalty
Comment 48.2	People who support and believe a “royal” family even exist are the reason they are keeping up with the pantomime. All actors in fancy dress
Comment49	For anyone wondering Dennis Skinner said:<br /> &quot;No&quot; followed by &quot;I&#39;ll not be going&quot;
Comment 49.1	I was waiting to hear something from Mr Skinner! 😂😁
Comment50	Good gracious... what a bunch of nonsense..
Comment51	Why does all this look funny and stupid now and not as important and serious as it used to be I think Parliament are making themselves all look like traitors to her majesty for going against the majority of the people’s vote
Comment52	Love Dennis Skinner
Comment53	Why slam the door in her face?
Comment 53.1	Luke Shacklock Yes you are right it stems from Charles 1st who originally stormed Parliament.
Comment 53.2	Chris S someone might correct me but I think it’s a gesture born from when Charles I entered the House of Commons during the civil war. The King/Queen is not allowed to enter the commons.
Comment54	Woooo a bunch of Satanists huh!!!
Comment55	She must be wearing a wig you dont reach 90 plus and still have perfect hair
Comment 55.1	@Chris Wainwright it is a wig just look at other queen speaches. In any event i dont think she looks well she will be dead within a year
Comment 55.2	She looks fabulous and all her own gorgeous hair too
Comment56	how these people keep a straight face is beyond me
Comment 56.1	respect for tradition i guess
Comment57	I honestly don’t think she could wear that thing any more - given her age and the fact that the thing is heavy as fuck lol
Comment58	Fuck Democracy
Comment59	What&#39;s with the long curtain attached to the old lady.  😂
Comment60	She let the world know that she is Queen and her word is to be obeyed and that’s it. You may think you have a democratic country. “Don’t you think”. The next deal Boris presents they all will accept. Period. She even wore the big necklace.
Comment61	Your Queen should take that rod and hit Deniss Skinner up side the head for being an a**hole. He should be forced to bow an extra 10 hours for his antics.
Comment62	Why is the Queen speaking to a Santa Clause convention? Never seen so many Santas in my life.
Comment63	Me when I run upstairs into my room after getting shouted out by my mum
Comment64	Cadbury moved factory to Poland 2011 with EU grant.<br /><br />Ford Transit moved to Turkey 2013 with EU grant.<br /><br />Jaguar Land Rover has recently agreed to build a new plant in Slovakia with EU grant, owned by Tata, the same company who have trashed our steel works and emptied the workers’ pension funds.<br /><br />Peugeot closed its Ryton (was Rootes Group) plant and moved production to Slovakia with EU grant.<br /><br />British Army&#39;s new Ajax fighting vehicles to be built in SPAIN using SWEDISH steel at the request of the EU to support jobs in Spain with EU grant, rather than Wales.<br /><br />Dyson gone to Malaysia, with an EU loan.<br /><br />Crown Closures, Bournemouth (Was METAL BOX), gone to Poland with EU grant, once employed 1,200.<br /><br />M&amp;S manufacturing gone to far east with EU loan.<br /><br />Hornby models gone. In fact all toys and models now gone from UK along with the patents all with EU grants. <br /><br />Gillette gone to eastern Europe with EU grant.<br />Texas Instruments, formerly of Greenock gone to Germany with EU grant.<br /><br />Indesit at Bodelwyddan Wales gone with EU grant.<br /><br />Sekisui Alveo said production at its Merthyr Tydfil Industrial Park foam plant will relocate production to Roermond in the Netherlands, with EU funding.<br /><br />Hoover Merthyr factory moved out of UK to Czech Republic and the Far East by Italian company Candy with EU backing.<br /><br />ICI integration into Holland’s AkzoNobel with EU bank loan and within days of the merger, several factories in the UK, were closed, eliminating 3,500 jobs.<br /><br />Boots sold to Italians Stefano Pessina who have based their HQ in Switzerland to avoid tax to the tune of £80 million a year, using an EU loan for the purchase.<br /><br />JDS Uniphase run by two Dutch men, bought up companies in the UK with £20 million in EU &#39;regeneration&#39; grants, created a pollution nightmare and just closed it all down leaving 1,200 out of work and an environmental clean-up paid for by the UK tax-payer. They also raided the pension fund and drained it dry.<br /><br />UK airports are owned by a Spanish company.<br /><br />Scottish Power is owned by a Spanish company.<br /><br />Most London buses are run by Spanish and German companies.<br /><br />The Hinkley Point C nuclear power station to be built by French company EDF, part owned by the French government, using cheap Chinese steel that has catastrophically failed in other nuclear installations. Now EDF say the costs will be double or more and it will be very late even if it does come online.<br /><br />Swindon was once our producer of rail locomotives and rolling stock. Not any more, it&#39;s Bombardier in Derby and due to their losses in the aviation market, that could see the end of the British railways manufacturing altogether even though Bombardier had EU grants to keep Derby going which they diverted to their loss-making aviation side in Canada.<br /><br />39% of British invention patents have been passed to foreign companies, many of them in the EU.<br /><br />The Mini cars that Cameron stood in front of as an example of British engineering, are built by BMW mostly in Holland and Austria. His campaign bus was made in Germany even though we have Plaxton, Optare, Bluebird, Dennis etc., in the UK.<br /><br />The bicycle for the Greens was made in the far east, not by Raleigh UK but then they are probably going to move to the Netherlands too as they have said recently.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks the EU is good for British industry or any other business simply hasn&#39;t paid attention to what has been systematically asset-stripped from the UK. Name me one major technology company still running in the UK.<br /><br />We don&#39;t teach electronic technology for technicians any more, due to EU regulations. Our brains were being de-industrialised!<br /><br />I haven&#39;t detailed our non-existent fishing industry the EU paid to destroy, nor the farmers being paid NOT to produce food they could sell for more than they get paid to do nothing.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t mentioned what it costs us to be asset-stripped like this, nor have I mentioned immigration, nor the risk to our security if control of our armed forces is passed to Brussels or Germany.<br /><br />Find something that&#39;s gone the other way, I&#39;ve looked and I just can&#39;t.<br /><br />Still want to stay? Well it must be some consolation that you have Cameron to negotiate in Europe on your behalf.<br /><br />And of course, the real deal-breaker .... Democracy, transparency and independence. We can vote out our MPs - BUT the European Commission who dictate 55% of UK laws, which are legally binding, are ..... guess what, untouchable, unelected and hidden from view.
Comment65	LOOK AT ALL THIS PURE BULLSHIT ALL PEDO&#39;S

Comment 143.2	Hey Ryan and Alexi guess what!? The Queen makes some of the rules up so she is not useless and lazy. She constantly goes places and makes relationships with foreign leaders. Also why do you think that she would abate this rabble into her house of traditions to make a small amount of money? She already is incredibly wealthy but she seeks power though not wealth.

Comment 151.3	@ht moh LOL why are you angry? I just made it as an example. Read and listen boi... your comments are such nonsense, use your brain sometimes, you live now for decades and yet you still don&#39;t use it? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 ignoramus
Comment 151.4	@Lance William Tsuji Gay? I guess it takes one to know one. Btw your pic looks gay. Unless you are a lady boy.
Comment152	Damn skinners comment cuts out, what does he say ??
Comment 152.1	He said, &quot;No...  I&#39;ll not be going.&quot;
Comment 152.2	what did Skinner say? &quot;I refuse to bow, I&#39;m too old and have bad knees&quot;.
Comment 152.3	MrGtasan123 Im not going. Thats his words
Comment153	How does the mayority of british people feels with this? i mean how do they feel about the royals, long time since we discovered that they weren&#39;t appointed by god, so do you still venerate them? i mean you still are paying for the whole royal family and last year was about 100 millions so why do you still maintain this.<br />PS: im not critizicing, im just trying to understand.
Comment 153.1	Raunak Chatterjee you give too much credit to the monarchy. I would think it’s our democracy and law that holds this country together. Also, we have Boris who is not that far off from Trump in looks and in morals so the monarchy hasn&#39;t really helped in that regard
Comment 153.2	@Linda Candy well there&#39;s a difference between the royals doing that and anybody doing that. I have made that amply clear in the my last comment.<br /><br />And also don&#39;t downplay ceremony so much. All nation states are essentially artificial, and it is these ceremonies and spectacles that play a role in holding things together. And also unlike the old and dreary museums they are living link to our past. Remove them and all we are left with are imbeciles like Corbyn and Johnson hurling priggish insult at each other.<br /><br />Secondly in any civil abolishment of the monarchy, the Royal family will retain the control of most of their land, thereby essentially making no difference to the treasury.<br /><br />And though they have little political power they do act as a last safety vaulve against dictatorship and provides stability. What if we kick lizzy out and end up with something like......er......i mustn&#39;t say.....TRUMP?
Comment 153.3	Raunak Chatterjee ceremonial stuff which anyone can do as you said. So why do we need the monarchy specifically for that? If all they are good for is a spectacle they are obviously not needed anymore
Comment 153.4	@Linda Candy all states need someone for the ceremonial stuffs. If you abolish the monarchy, you still need someone for the state visits, for opening Parliament, for laying the wreath of remembrance, for handing out medals. Like the Irish or German President. The only difference are monarchs are more visible and colorful. Like the whole world knows about the British monarch, but few can name the Irish or German President without googling.
Comment 153.5	Raunak Chatterjee I agree to disagree that the monarchy works well. If they have no power what’s their relevancy?
Comment154	Remoaners are so desperate for an extension they should have agreed to an election and formed a new government to ask for it. But they know full well they would lose as the public hates them.
Comment 154.1	If this stupid Government, under  Cameron had not brought in the fixed term parliament  act, then Boris Johnson could have called a election when he wanted, and not to had depended on a vote in the House of Commons. so the Tories brought this problem on themselves. Tory party are a bunch of idiots.
Comment155	BLACK ROD TO YOU ALL.....FROM JEJUS.
Comment156	It seems like a play.  Why can&#39;t they just act normal? The whole thing is so pretentious and schicki micki superficial.
Comment 156.1	Okay pal.

Comment 157.1	I heard &quot;No, I&#39;ll not be going&quot;
Comment 157.2	I’ll not be going
Comment158	Lol black rod.. sounds like whoever came up with that name was doing it for sh!ts and giggles
Comment 158.1	@Common sense...<br />You mean naming the usher of the actual black rod Usher of The Black Rod?<br /><br />It defies &quot;common sense&quot; in a way if you over think things. 🤔
Comment 158.2	Uploaded by &quot;BBC&quot; ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Comment159	"Peasant Woman: &quot;Order&quot;, eh? Who does he think he is?<br />King Arthur: I am your king.<br />Peasant Woman: Well, I didn&#39;t vote for you.<br />King Arthur: You don&#39;t vote for kings.<br />Peasant Woman: Well, how&#39;d you become king, then?"

Comment 164.2	@Meikel Wupp ah, I see. That&#39;s sort of depressing. Thank you for the answer : )
Comment 164.3	Chlamydia Cockburn I think it is too heavy for her to carry it
Comment165	Is Black Rod a woman?
Comment 165.1	@gareth double ah :)
Comment 165.2	this year :)
Comment166	At 4min24 when Black rod is knocking on the door, the spot where she&#39;s knocking is discoloured and worn. Is that from all the times it&#39;s been knocked on like that?
Comment 166.1	A. S. yes
Comment 166.2	@gareth double so much history in Britain, I am glad they still hold that performance, I just love the UK 😍
Comment 166.3	correct :) they dont repair it so those chips are from the same rod knocking the same spot for many many years.
Comment167	Will the person who commentated on the event play back the recording and count how many &#39;ers&#39; and &#39;erms&#39; he included. Please do not repeat this bad habit.

Comment168	Breaking news: Black Rod appears at house of Lords, shafts mp&#39;s up the arse.
Comment 168.1	@Autodidact2 ironnie
Comment 168.2	@Autodidact2 it&#39;s a joke and my phone auto corrects so get fucked.  It&#39;s YouTube not an English exam. Go be a petty correcter else where.
Comment 168.3	@Jonathan White You are correct, but you misspelled two of the three words in you comment!
Comment 168.4	@MrRedeyedJedi It&#39;s always &quot;MP&quot; or &quot;MPs&quot; not &quot;mp&quot; or your illiterate &quot;mps [sic]&quot;. And you misspelled &quot;its&#39;, the pronoun, &quot;differentiates&quot; and &quot;acronym&quot;, so why should anyone take your advice on spelling seriously? The apostrophe is passé in plural acronyms and has been for many years. Idiot!
Comment169	Give back the stolen crown
Comment 169.1	prince elly Try coming &amp; taking it back !
Comment170	Not wearing the crown is a probable symbolic move by HM.
Comment 170.1	Nah. It&#39;s just because of her age and the crown is too heavy for her.
Comment 170.2	@LGranthamsHeir She didn&#39;t wear the crown in 2017 either, but she was dressed more casually that time and had the notorious &quot;EU Hat&quot; with the flowers on.<br /><br />If you saw that documentary about her coronation she demonstrates just how heavy that crown actually is and how difficult it can be to wear it while trying to read a speech.  I think she just doesn&#39;t want to wear it anymore given her age.
Comment 170.3	Could be a sign of old age as well. She&#39;s 93 after all...
Comment171	Stone age people
Comment 171.1	@Matthew Gallagher well more baroque and Victorian. The mediveal ceremony was much more simpler i guess.

Comment 176.1	​@Captain America Do you know how stupidly arrogant and racist you sound?
Comment 176.2	You need a black woman, Meghan, as your Queen to show your multiculturalism. The rest of Europe might think you&#39;re racist if you don&#39;t let her become Queen.
Comment 176.3	@Kevon Thomas Not only that, but the act of parliament then would have to be ratified by all 53 other Commonwealth countries besides the UK.

Comment179	Charles made her walk too fast !   She was all out of breath when sitting down.  What the hell is Camilla Parker Bowls, all dressed up and nowhere to go, doing there ?   She was not supposed to be Queen Consort, remember ?
Comment 179.1	@gareth double I think Anne is the most sensible and humble one but she will never reach those heights.<br /><br />Rumour has it the Queen would rather have Anne succeed her, but she doesn&#39;t have any say in the order of succession.
Comment 179.2	@gareth double me neither.her royal highness Camilla park your balls 👑
Comment 179.3	shes the most down to earth of them all. Cant wait for the reign of Queen Camilla
Comment180	What did Dennis Skinner quipped?
Comment 180.1	@Shurl Stirling I was talking to the user who criticized Skinner. Sorry to waste your time in typing out that argument
Comment 180.2	@Lord McLeod Versatile Sportelli 2 Dennis Skinner is loved and respected from all sides. he is the only mp that truly stands up for the working man. he was the only mp to stand on the picket line with the miners.<br />please wash your mouth out and mind your manners.<br />he nearly lost his life to cancer but recovered and returned to politics.<br />he&#39;s been an mp for Balsover since 1970.<br />  it&#39;s on record the queen loves his little quips.  (sorry knee jerk reaction I have much respect for this old miner)
Comment 180.3	Brian Passmore I think you’ll find he’s the only working class MP in the entire House . Coming from the pits that the conservatives destroyed!
Comment 180.4	@Brian Passmore away and bile yer heid

Comment 181.1	B B C .
Comment 181.2	@gareth double  THANK for the  info.
Comment 181.3	Shuff it up your arse
Comment 181.4	Black Rod is the queens messenger. Black rods job is to call the house of commons (elected officials) to the house of lords (unelected officials).They slam the door in black rods face because its symbolic that the Queen and her lords actually has no authority to command them to do anything. They open door because they want to, not because theyre commanded. Hope this helps x
Comment182	Meanwhile in the REAL world......

Comment 183.3	@Karen Byrd thanks, I&#39;ve read the Gettysburg address. I come from Ireland, I owe them nothing. The Queen did a Boris Johnson General election speech, the majority of it will not get through parliament..
Comment 183.4	@Karen Byrd thanks for explaining that, I would not have known.
Comment 183.5	Why do so many people on this planet speak a language of a people who came, principally, from a part of an island that part being about 50K sq miles? You speak and write that language without having any respect for the very people and their traditions who created that language. Course you ignored the Queen&#39;s speech which was about things very much part of the 21st cent.
Comment184	SLITHERIN !!!!!!!
Comment 184.1	Oh, you&#39;re proud of your own house. Nice
Comment185	First time I saw both BORIS JOHN SON and JEREMY  CORBYN  walking together<br />towards  BREXIT ( from INDIAN)

Comment187	The black queen of death u lived as much as it took u to see ur country devastated not by Russia cold war not by the Nazis in Germany but by the british themselves whose parents fought causeless wars over decades and occupied nations as well , payback time has just started<br /><br />Now u would wish u died before this a long time ago !
Comment 187.1	@Matthew Gallagher <br />so it is a race instead of showing sorrow for what u did and instead of feeling ur guiltand instead of giving compensations to ur devil deeds  u come to talk that way !! u cannot hear about the scandals in my country although u have bbc and satellites bec the scandals of ur country filled the entire space<br />bloody history for a bloody country
Comment 187.2	Yasser Naguib Yeah I’m sure you’re country hasn’t committed any atrocities over the years, care to tell me where you’re from so I can make a fun top 10 worst acts your countries done since you think you have moral superiority
Comment 187.3	@Matthew Gallagher <br />I am not going indian and why do u care for my nationality if ur bloody history speaks for itself !<br />And if I was indian then it was u who was obsessed Bec u cut a distance of half the earth to occupy other nations , fake civilizations
Comment 187.4	You Indians are obsessed with the UK, quite funny

Comment188	Remarkable woman....wait until you listen to her Brexit Now speech. By the look on her face , she is disgusted at the treason that has been taking place these past three years by these vipers in her Houses.
Comment 188.1	Ummm 27 socialists v 1 Eng er Land ! Com on Capitalism you will win again, and without Socialist Scots. PS. Nice BREXIT from JAPAN SCOTTIES !!! Love in it.

Comment193	So much ceremony for someone with no power, absolutely none, zip, nada.
Comment 193.1	And so many words in a comment with no knowledge in UK politics. Ja-ran. Instant expert.
Comment194	Why did you cut it off at 6 minutes? Thumbs down for being incompetent.
Comment195	Dennis skinner cracks me up🤣
Comment196	Slammed in her face as a sign of authority🤔
Comment 196.1	After 67 years and 67 Parliaments, I think that She&#39;s used to it. If She can tolerate Donald Trump with composure after he ruins Her ceremonial lawn with his helicopter, She can face off anybody. Her Majesty is well aware of the foibles of other people&#39;s children.
Comment 196.2	Black Rod is the Queen&#39;s representative. The reason the door is slammed in her face is because King Charles the 1st stormed Parliament just before the civil war against normal protocol. Since that event no monarch can enter the House of Commons where the Parliament sits, Black Rod does this as representative. The door is slammed as a representation of Parliament&#39;s authority.
Comment 196.3	@gareth double very correct, this is the only reason a MP can hackle the black rod .. else it would have been punished offence.
Comment 196.4	@Christopher Tito thats the point. she can command all she wants but the elected officials go by choice. Her &#39;power&#39; to command is nullified.
Comment 196.5	@gareth double And yet after that the Black Rod says that the Queen &quot;commands&quot; the MPs to go see her
Comment197	Waste time .UK never going leave .so riot kill riot
Comment 197.1	Name says it all !! Zero Brain Cells
Comment198	Things like this are always great it draws the looney left out of the wood work and they attack people they really shouldn&#39;t
Comment 198.1	@Linda Candy fuck all that bollocks take an exstacy pill you no longer care, now i am off to dance.
Comment 198.2	Paul c sorry that&#39;s your experience but I&#39;ve also experienced the flip side where I&#39;m trying to explain to someone why something may be racist and they dismiss my point as playing the race card or being too sensitive. So it happens on both sides
Comment 198.3	@Linda Candy The most loudest are the people that scream racism everytime someone states the obvious problem like a certain minority and it can never be debated as it is just shut down with the opposition called racists for telling the truth.
Comment 198.4	Paul c I think political correctness and virtue signalling is often confused with developing a moral conscience as our society advances. With social media things are easily taken to the extreme on both sides, twitter is brutal, and the more level-headed opinions are drowned out by the more loudest and reactionary voices
Comment 198.5	@Linda Candy It just seems to me political correctness and virtue signaling that has become more of a mental illness is now clouding peoples judgment on making the most prudent moves for a better society.
Comment199	Curious that you kick off Europe and you keep this.... hmmmm
Comment 199.1	Better than your paedo Pope
Comment200	I&#39;m thankful something traditional like this exists to represent our countries heritage rather than events like the Notting Hill Carnival.
Comment 200.1	pablo9364 ... That is debatable!!!! And it still costs the taxpayers a lot of money.  Nothing in this life is free.
Comment 200.2	pablo9364  Yea but what kind of people ?
Comment 200.3	Trebor Mints no but it brings a lot of joy to a lot of people
Comment 200.4	pablo9364   Do you know how much it costs to police the Notting Hill Carnival and clean up afterwards?
Comment 200.5	Trebor Mints Well said that Knotting Hill excuse for debauchery &amp; criminality should have been quelled by troops .That kind of riotous behaviour belongs in some Bongolesian banana republic shit hole not in Britain !
Comment201	From start to finish, all I see is a drain on the taxpayer from this grotesque cast. Lots of joyous cuts I can see here.
Comment 201.1	Plot twist:<br /><br /><b>James bond arrives and cocks gun</b><br /><br />James: All of parliament, Ma&#39;am?<br /><br />Queen: Yes 007, the bloody lot.
Comment 201.2	AWResistance and the royal family are so useful at least single mothers raise their own children
Comment 201.3	Yet, it is much cheaper than must of Republics.
Comment 201.4	@Richard -  Cheaper than paying for useless sinlge mothers.
Comment202	Long live the queen! Out means out !
Comment203	Put the queen in charge again, stop these traitors, HRH she stayed in country when we were at war with her people , her mum helped in the war, her dad wanted to land on the beaches, PROUD TO BE U.K.. bring it on . I would rather be her people, then be represented by this parliament, a IRA and terrorist sympathiser in her parliament, wonder how that will work oh yeah a zombie Parliament HOW DOES THIS PROTECT THE U.K.  🤷🏻‍♂️it’s a  PC world that’s  gone mad 😡
Comment204	This is the most tory English crap that has ever existed. No wonder Scotland wanted independence from these masonic child eaters.
Comment 204.1	@toon army Democracy is the idea that the people can change their minds, that&#39;s the point.
Comment205	JERMEY CORBYNS 🤣🤣🤣P.O.U.K PAKISTAN OCCUPIED UNITED KINGDOM!
Comment206	Seems outdated to us Americans; however,  it appears the Queen is bringing much needed order to a chaotic government in shifting times.
Comment 206.1	toon army - We pride ourselves on being the land of the free and the home of the brave. We are considered the freedom super heroes of the world and have freedom running out our ears. As for the age of consent, I am free to have sex with a 16 year old. If your country has a lower age of consent, then I think you&#39;re crossing the line into pedophilia. Yes we have a few trigger happy cops that accidentally shoot people, but they&#39;re not free to do this. Your cops choke people out and kill them, so whats the difference?
Comment 206.2	toon army - I see you limey&#39;s are still in the body count contest to see who has the least murders. We give up, you win the contest. Now excuse me while I  exercise my freedoms and go to the shooting range to have some fun. We&#39;re not trading our freedoms and rights to lower murder rates. Crime prevention is the job of the judicial system.
Comment 206.3	@toon army yes exactly. I wasn&#39;t saying that was wrong.. The fact you presumed me to be American for not sharing the same highly restrictive views of weapons in the UK was wrong lol. As I said, there is a lot more gang activity in America, due to culture, that is more likely the attributing factor to the slightly higher percentages of knife related crime, as opposed to the freedom to carry such a weapon, in its self.
Comment 206.4	@toon army I know all that and you are wrong I&#39;m afraid :) I&#39;m part of the gun community in the UK. Im British through and through. I&#39;ve heard both sides of the argument to death. The figures in America are about the same, ratio wise if you compare the differences in population, however due to the cultural differences, there are more gang related activities in America.
Comment 206.5	@toon army I didn&#39;t say knives should be carried around. You missed my point completely. Everyone should have the right to defend themselves. Criminals don&#39;t care about laws, they carry what they want. They use numbers to their advantage, with it illegal to carry a weapon for self defence, which everyone should have a right too BTW, it leaves law abiding citizens at a massive disadvantage. Can you send me a link to your source for your stats, of the states having 8 times more knife related deaths in relation to population of the two countries? I suspect most of those are in ghettos and gang related areas.
Comment207	this is a little odd to see in 2019. they sure do things differently just like their judicial system. I don`t even know what black rod is. I would be clueless at something like this.
Comment 207.1	@Nathan Fletcher &quot;...and then Britain lost all the land they had brutally colonized. The End.&quot;<br /><br />Thanks for the book rec, that was wonderful.
Comment 207.2	Read your history books
Comment 207.3	It&#39;s certainly archaic. I&#39;m curious to see how the protocol changes, if at all, once &#39;ol Liz finally kicks the bucket.
Comment 207.4	american psycho just stick to your title..it fits
Comment208	What a waste of time and money for a stupid show just to decide on EU. Did not think when joining. All old fart fighting for their position and money if they can eat and take with them.
Comment209	Borris Johnson is the only option for the UK to survive! Jermey corbyn is a  anti semetic jihadi appoliggizer. He has no place in international politics.
Comment210	Our Boris`s text for HM`s speech was going gangbusters right up until the pernicious insanity of climate change was mentioned, ergo, therefore, axiomatically, all hope is lost for the UK!
Comment211	can’t relate
Comment212	This is 2019 people of Britain ! Can we let go of something that’s no longer serve us?
Comment 212.1	The British keep their traditions by dressing up and doing silly pantomimes. The Yanks keep their traditions by uphoding archaic gun laws and banning abortions. 😉

Comment 217.1	pablo9364 I don’t give a shit about the fake democracy of Parliament .I believe in cutting out the middle man &amp; a Military government The damp rag politicians prevaricate &amp; get nowhere fast while feathering their own nests .The Military don’t pussyfoot about ,the chiefs of staff have a pow wow &amp; then brief the troops ,&amp; action arses kicked job sorted ,that’s what I call getting things done &amp; progress !
Comment 217.2	Gary Dodgson the future will be gained by a country that can adapt to an ever changing world.  A future government may have what it takes but no one at this time in the entire House of Commons has what it takes.  House of Commons seems to have the snowflake generations who are interested in politics as constituents .  Worst House of Commons ever. Britain remains divided in many ways.
Comment 217.3	pablo9364 Without a past to learn from you have no future to gain !
Comment 217.4	Better than Islam and Communism.
Comment 217.5	That’s why Britain will always be stuck in the past .
Comment218	Seriously... XXI century guys...
Comment 218.1	It&#39;s what separates us from the colonial shite like America
Comment 218.2	Who cares. ..
Comment219	When that bloke blows his trumpet doesn&#39;t it make all the Tories want to start hunting foxes? How do they hold back?
Comment 219.1	Hahaha😁
Comment 219.2	They have poor ppl to hunt now
Comment220	This shit funny
Comment221	Most stupid thing i’ve ever seen.
Comment222	That&#39;s just comical!
Comment223	&quot;Black Rod&quot; &quot;Head&quot; &quot;Comm-on&quot; &quot;Queen&quot;<br /><br />I say, the Brits are bloody brash.
Comment224	Our Wonderful Queen, 93 years old &amp; still has so much love &amp; respect across this country, How many 93 year olds do you know who are still working, God Bless Our Wonderful Classy Queen!
Comment 224.1	I&#39;d still be &quot;working&quot; at that age as well if all I had to do was sit around playing with dogs all day.
Comment 224.2	@Erik E yes who  dose  the QUEEN  make up, 🤔
Comment 224.3	She look like 52 in age not a rinkle in Face strange 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Comment 224.4	Barbara 1 Could you imagine her reading out Jeremy Corbyn’s I think she would’ve choked on her own tongue
Comment 224.5	Long live the Queen
Comment225	Okay i prob should show some respect for the ancient tradition but im involuntarily laughing lol
Comment226	will you just make Charles, the friggin King l already, I mean how long must he wait? until he is no longer capable...so stupid...can&#39;t wait to see William sit through this every year ;P
Comment 226.1	@Karen Byrd the key point then resides in answering the following question does she serve the best interests of the UK by preventing Charles sitting on the throne while he can make a mark on the country?
Comment 226.2	Not until his mother dies. She won&#39;t retire/abdicate. When she became queen she pledged that whether her life be long or short it would be devoted to the service of UK.  She will not break that pledge even if Phillip dies before her. Charles may never become king. Truthfully William should be at this ceremony not Camilla.
Comment227	What did Dennis Skinner say?
Comment 227.1	He said No, I’ll not be going.
Comment228	All this wiff waff is starting to look outdated.  I hope the uk people will take Brexit as an opportunity to not only leave the EU but also get rid of their old fashioned and boring establishment.
Comment 228.1	Won’t happen.  Britain is buried in the past.
Comment 228.2	Mick Maphari Im all for age old <br />Catuvellauni, Trinovantes or Iceni type traditions, these are your TRUE roots.  This us boring and outdated establishment wuff waff . Your country needs to move forward.
Comment 228.3	Well, that&#39;s a bit of a stupid comment. The UK is leaving the EU precisely in order to maintain it&#39;s age-old traditions. Though Scotland may be leaving the UK before long, Ireland shall reunite, Wales will devolve in time, and then it&#39;ll just be little old England. Paradise on Earth!

Comment234	*Just RULE BRITANNIA! GSTQ!
Comment235	wow she is looking old and frail
Comment 235.1	@Dani Pfisterer not that exceptional when you consider she has the best private health care money can buy, advisors left right and center and the best food. She probably has someone to wipe her ass for her as well. I think a lot of people would still be spritley if they too had that lifestyle.
Comment 235.2	Julia Connell Boris has got a few years left in him surely
Comment 235.3	Julia Connell well yeah, I was just trying to add context because I quite admire her fitness for her age
Comment 235.4	@Dani Pfisterer wasn&#39;t an criticism - simply an observation
Comment 235.5	Julia Connell she’s 93. the fact she can do this at all is exceptional.
Comment236	17.4
