Comment1	Wtf! How do the Scots put up with this awful woman
Comment2	This woman is the most dangerous person in the United Kingdom. I don&#39;t think people in England or Scotland realise how terrible the breaking up of the UK would be. A 400 year old union of great nations, destroyed for the pleasure of no one except this glory seeking dwarf. I am proud of these islands, and believe that we share a huge amount of tradition, culture and history. We are joined as one for that reason.
Comment3	The SNP slogan should be ‚ÄúTake power from London and hand it to Brussels‚Äù
Comment4	Just remember when you wanted to leave the EU said go but you won`t be coming back!
Comment5	Bet that was the first big O Sturgeon has had for a long time.
Comment6	BREXIT - WE SHALL DEFEND OUR ISLAND, WHATEVER THE COST MAY BE. WE SHALL FIGHT ON THE BEACHES. WE SHALL FIGHT ON THE LANDING GROUNDS. WE SHALL FIGHT IN THE FIELDS AND IN THE STREETS, WE SHALL FIGHT IN THE HILLS, WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER.
Comment7	Can Jo Swinson speak without moving her head? It&#39;s a wonder her arse doesn&#39;t move too since her gob is attached to it. Wobble-head Swinson.
Comment8	Welcome to the disunited kingdomish.
Comment9	Snp wants to take back there laws from Westminster just to give it to Brussels üòÇüòÇ
Comment 9.1	exactly, fuck the uk
Comment10	I&#39;ve always wondered why the mainstream media refuse to call the SNP racist or far right. They&#39;re very quick to label parties such as For Britain &#39;far right&#39; and racist for speaking out about radical islam... Yet a party that is clearly anti British gets a wealth of air time on British TV.
Comment11	What may come to pass is the Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia solution:  dismemberment and the formation of new nations in Europa.  Should this occur in the UK, that might signal the end of the monarchy and the Queen may be the last Windsor to reign.
Comment12	Fish woman is very irresponsible for Scotland. Why not wait and see how Brexit affects Scotland you may well end up better off. She clearly just wants independence and dont really care what is good for Scotland. You have the opportunity to wait and make the right decision for Scotland in a year or two. If she had Scotlands best interests at heart instead of her own wants that is what she would do.
Comment13	Support Scotland,.say no to England
Comment14	So the SNP want to hold England in the EU against its will, while wanting independence from the UK.
Comment 14.1	no, they want to keep Scotland in the EU, because Scotland voted to remain
Comment15	The Scots should take back control.
Comment 15.1	india should reduce its population by one billion.
Comment16	Poo
Comment17	Only 500 people own half of Scotland.She is obviously appeasing them and ONLY them.
Comment18	Every time I hear this woman I think of Tracy Ullman&#39;s impression of her. I expect &quot;Wee Mairi&quot; to pop up and start shouting her maiden speech at Laura Keunsberg.
Comment19	Totally illogical. She wants to leave the UK but stay in the EU. How is that independence.
Comment20	tbf the only reason I want them to stay so we don&#39;t have to get rid of our flag....
Comment 20.1	Curtis fuck ur flag, butchers apron
Comment 20.2	You can keep your flag, just give us your rights.
