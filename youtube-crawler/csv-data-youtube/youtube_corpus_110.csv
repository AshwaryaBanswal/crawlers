Comment3	Quel bordel, mama mia...
Comment4	If Boris is required by Parliament to go to the EU to ask for an extension to the leaving date, here is the solution. Charles de Gaulle had a habit of asking &#39;double questions&#39; during French elections, eg &#39;Do you want lower taxes and me to stay in power?&#39;<br /><br />Since people were likely to ask for lower tax es they voted &#39;yes&#39; and accepted de Gaulle as President by default. Boris could do the same. ie: ask the EU for and extension to Brexit and for a treaty giving favourable trading conditions to the UK. <br /><br />The EU will have to say no, Boris has done Parliaments wish to ask for an extension and we will come out on the 31 October
Comment5	This isn&#39;t even about Brexit or the EU anymore. If Parliament won&#39;t do what the UK people want on this issue, is there any issue where the people will be allowed to have a say in?
Comment6	Or maybe Bobby Ewing is still in the shower....

Comment12	O PM contorcionista, deu dupla pirueta...e o seu contrário ..Além da chuva farta-se de meter água!! Ordem é a palavra certa para a desordem do Brexit que se tornou um trinta e um para o Reino Unido!!
Comment13	We can be sure to say that they will never leave the union, even if they vote again and the outcome is the same again, the same thing will happen, remainers will keep pushing for the uk to stay and will keep sabotaging efforts to leave, so I sense Britain has entered an eternal limbo of suffering, divisiveness and indecision that in the end will literally tear the country apart, it had to happen somewhere in the multiverse.
Comment14	Bercow is another Cow
Comment15	This speaker is against the UK people.
Comment16	Bercow: The Protector of Democracy!
Comment17	the Never Trump, Never Brexit, Feminist tyranny station
Comment18	The Remoaners had their chances, but they wanted too much.<br />General Elections now!<br />Brexit Party all the way. It is the only garantee in these days. The manifesto’s of the mainstream parties mean nothing.
Comment19	Down with the rat.
Comment20	Brexit means brexit
Comment21	John Bercow to the parliament “ Ordaaaa  we’re going to watch Harry portaaaa “ 😂😂😂😂
Comment22	♫ Never gonna ditch EU up ♫<br />♫ Doris gonna ditch himself up ♫
Comment23	Every time Hilary Benn and Anna Soubry open their mouths they show themselves to be either without intelligence or without principals or both. Stop telling people what they think, you are so out of touch with your electorate it’s laughable. We see what you’re doing and we will not forgive or forget easily.
Comment24	Just ask Merlin to cast a spell of unification!
Comment25	Kick m out ! Sick off this bullshit! Bye bye good luck!
Comment26	Ohhh just get on with it! Stop holding it all up! You’ve had years to get this done!
Comment27	Rush?  It’s been 3.5 yrs of waiting.  Plenty of time to work together for a clean BREXIT... but fake Labour  &amp; tyrannical EU didn’t want any BREXIT.. delay, plant fear, delay some more till the globalists billionaires could decide where to invest their (stolen) funds.
Comment28	BENN YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHIT !... SOUBURY... TIME TO SHUT UP.. YOU AMOUNT TO NOTHING...
Comment29	Big mouth burcow... soon my friend, you will come to the end...
Comment30	So the way it seems. The British people voted for brexit so long ago and yet it has not happened? So much for democracy.
Comment31	"It is actually treachery to demand a FAKE Brexit and a FRAUDULENT deal. <br /><br />I have been trying to inform those who are unaware is that we are not and never were in their EU, as it was an illegal void agreement. <br /><br />Some instead take the lying words of unlawful now coverty privatised (registered at Dun &amp; Bradstreet) company courts that we did legally join. I then point out to them that even if we had (we never) we would have left on the 29th March. <br /><br />What is needed is for Brexiteers to know that either way we are not in the EU, therefore a future Brexit and related deal is fraudulent. Thus we need to demand the admission from MP&#39;s, the PM and all Peers and Judiciary that we are not in the EU, and so any deal with EU or other nations is a separate matter to any membership - as we are not members. <br /><br />Unfortunately, although a lot of people &#39;like&#39; and &#39;love&#39; this, they immediately discard it and prompty continue ranting about the fake Brexit and deal, foregoing the opportunity to prevent them committing further lucrative for them frauds and also committing many other great wrongs in relation to us discarding unlawful statutes and case law, as well as stopping our ability to do as Iceland did in 2008 (Jailing some banksters and their corrupt politician relatives etc., and kicking the rest out. Iceland went from bankrupted by them to 4th largest GDP,  and without the greedy they all enjoyed a fair share of their country&#39;s wealth. Unfortunately, they were plonkers and not so long ago let the banksters back in. Then they lost their airline and so most of their American tourist trade, which made up circa a third of their GDP. They have their airline back again, but much financial damage done. Iceland should have kept them out.<br />We must stop the lies that we are in the EU and that we are seeking a deal, then we MUST do as Iceland did in 2008 but always refuse to allow those robber bankster barons and their corrupt unlawfully, overly powerful relatives back in. <br /><br />Demand the Admission We Are NOT In The EU. That is the only argument that counts. All else is a bankster trick and distraction. Refuse to fall for their dark psychological operations on you.<br /><br />MP&#39;s in ALL viable parties and &#39;independants&#39; who are banksters or members of their families - and you trust and believe them? <br />Jeremiah or Jacob - only different paths to the same hell for the general public - globalist heaven for them. Check out their families and THEIR behaviour. <br /><br /><a href=""http://humansarefree.com/"">humansarefree.com</a>"

Comment39	Who will win:<br />Totalitarianism, Anarchy, War....<br />vs.<br />Order<br />🤔
Comment40	Imagine, parliament being allowed to scrutinise a bill properly. Boris Johnson doesn’t seem to to like the idea of that
Comment41	btexit is confusing I am baffled
Comment42	Whats the point of getting a deal from EU and yet MPs using  all sort of excuses not to get it voted. Betrayers are the Labour MPs.
Comment43	What a disgusting little man.

Comment 46.1	And English also can&#39;t date with German.
Comment47	My god this report is so biased at the start.
Comment48	Bercow the Snake
Comment49	If the BBC wasn&#39;t so biased itself it could make a good programme on the bias of the speaker.  He is being investigated currently but he is doing his damage now and will retire before it is too late to matter.
Comment50	If we choose no deal from this Brexit then it&#39;s a no deal. we survived in this country on our own before until the houses of commons decides to mess things up immigration tax rises living costs rising we need to pull out and change how it use to be before its too late.
Comment51	Stand with UK Protesters！
Comment 51.1	Throw mama from the train lol

Comment 56.1	Adrian Millward     Have your pills 💊
Comment 56.2	Shut up dick head.
Comment57	Ooo shit.... Here we go again!
Comment58	Well...<br />The reason for the speaker to vote the way he did, is more then symbolic.<br />The government can not just have the same motion on the floor again and again, until the administration gets what they want.<br />They should NOT rush to any agreement<br />Besides ...<br />The vote for leaving was based on lies an deception anyway.
Comment 58.1	Erhardt Nice rant you must think you’re so clever.
Comment 58.2	Craig Smith ...<br />Oh you are so correct sir...<br />Seems like you looking forward for less wages...less protection for workers...😜<br />Anyway...<br />The money will go surely to the NHS ... because Boris and Nigel promised that...😂😂😂<br />Funny story...<br />Because of Brexit ... I got a job offer from the UK 🇬🇧 government.<br />Because of the number of people leaving.<br />Aaaah... rule Britania...Britania rule the waves... never never ever shall be slaves...<br />So funny people thinking that being OUTSIDE the biggest single market on the planet, will be a good thing.<br />Well...<br />Japan just joint with a nice agreement, the single market to get rid of any obstacles it might have had in the past with the EU 🇪🇺<br />Let me guess...finances was NOT your major in collage 😝<br />Oh by the way...<br />Mr. Rees-Mogg ...the man who watched upstairs-downstairs one to many times, just last year moved the headquarters of his business to Dublin, to stay WITHIN the single market... so in essence ... peaching water, drinking wine...<br />Good job Jacob..✌️<br />He and his Eaton collage friends will not feel the outcome of those decisions, of course not... why would they...😜
Comment 58.3	Erhardt Neither we’ll be more beneficial because we’ll be more competitive than our counterparts in the protectionist racket and the £350.000M per week was for when we leave the EU which the tories have agreed to spend more on the NHS.
Comment 58.4	Craig Smith ...<br />Good morning Craig ✌️<br />Good point, so we agree... scaremongering all around...(350.000.000 per week ...😝)<br />But let’s put aside the small differences and look at the simple financial aspect of this whole Brexit mess.<br />In order to achieve its goals on bringing prosperity and wealth, more then now... bringing more into the UK and/or being competitive with the EU...one of two things has to happen...<br />Either ...<br />Workers (blue collar or white collar) will have to earn LESS then the European counterparts, in the future...with prices rising...<br />Or...<br />Workers (blue collar or white collar) will have LESS overall benefits and protection then now, in order for company’s to attract any manufacturers to move to the UK....wich one would you like to have..?<br />Besides, it will be most likely a combination of both.
Comment 58.5	Erhardt I know remember when they said we would go into a recession and loose 500,00 jobs solely on the vote... wait wrong campaign.
Comment59	Boris caused the problem in the first place with the blatant &quot;£350m/week for NHS&quot; lie on his stupid bus
Comment60	Baker says: &quot;rotten house of commons&quot;; poor guy...thwarted again.
Comment61	I don’t understand what’s going on anymore...
Comment62	This not an ordinary day or time so like reopening parliament the vote was of the highest importance for the nation and for him to delay it some rules must be broken if the nation wills it. He is BIAS AND SHOULD BE SACKED
Comment63	the BBC political analyst seems to agree and therefore presuppose that the most important thing is to leave the UK leave by the 31st of October come hell or high water.  which means she basically agrees with the agenda of BJ.
Comment64	CHAMPION MAN!!!
Comment65	By now we should be hearing the dramatic drum ending of eastenders at the end of each youtube video on brexit.
Comment66	"Cost of brexit....insane!<br /><a href=""https://costofbrexit.netlify.com/"">https://costofbrexit.netlify.com/</a>"
Comment67	BBC known to get to the Bottom of things,down the Pan so apt.
Comment68	<b>Bercow has made the UK Parliament a laughing stock all around the world. He needs to make an grovelling apology to the British people for the immense damage he has done to the image of the UK</b><br /><b>as a bastion of Democracy. Bercow knows that the May deal was voted on 3 times. He also knows that Johnson&#39;s withdrawal agreement was pulled after the Letwin amendment, so was never even voted</b> <b>on. He is playing very silly games, and in the process he is making a mockery of UK Democracy. The UK voters can see it, the EU can see it, the rest of the World can see it. He has No Credibility at all</b>
Comment69	Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008<br /><br />The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations protects consumers from unfair or misleading trading practices and ban misleading omissions and aggressive sales tactics.<br /><br />- I guess that doesn&#39;t apply to government.
Comment70	I&#39;m sick of this. Just leave!
Comment 70.1	Perhaps you are right. However the reason of my words got nothing to do with fatigue. This failure of the British Parliament to find a consensus that sets the path for the country is hurting everyone and is beginning to be disrespectful. The European Union it self implies very tiring processes and negotiations. That&#39;s not the problem.
Comment 70.2	If you think leaving on the 31st is going to be the end of it, you are sorely mistaken. The transition period will be incredibly hectic. The post transition period will likely be even more so. Leaving just because of fatigue is misguided and based on shallow thinking.
Comment71	They all know loaf of Bread will be £5, pack of 6 eggs  £10,  meat will be 10 Times higher, pint of milk will be £7, tin of beans £4, basically all food with be 10 Times higher. renting out properties will sky rocket and more people on the streets the previous prime ministers know this and it was just easy to jump ship so the next prime minister deals with this farce that will cause chaos and poverty
Comment72	Soubry is a nazi tra lala la.
Comment73	Ye,  your getting the guillotine when we have our civil war.   Nazis are not welcome in England.
Comment74	People go look at the council of 300 and the statutory slave system they run against the people.   We all need to withdraw consent to be governed and put an ecclesiastical deed poll in to the Vatican.   Let&#39;s hang them all for treason m
Comment75	Soubry is a nazi tra lala la
Comment76	I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THIS KIND OF SHOUTING  IN A PARLIAMENT WAS CLEAN TO THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES. BREXIT DEBATE RELATIVE MY THOUGHT
Comment 76.1	WHICH KIND OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I HAVE NEVER SEEN DEBATES IN OUR PARLIAMENTS. I AM FULL OF ENVY TO BE HONEST OF BRITISH PEOPLE!!!
Comment77	in england taxpayers have been forced to pay big £5 million pensions to bankrupt bankers, (RBOS) while others have to use food handouts to survive. england is very corrupt.<br /><br />but they have been hoodwinked again into thinking the eu are the dictators....
Comment78	No deal is better than a bad deal. Brexit mean Brexit. It will be the easiest deal in history. OODDDDDDDAAAAAAAAAAAA
Comment79	Laughable how Boris is labeled a failure to deliver Brexit when at EVERY turn, EVERY effort is colluded to block, obstruct , defeat the government’s goal by the traitorous  majority in  Parliament  and their little,  lap dog euroshill “ sitting up” in the Speakers
Comment80	Labour! Warum wollt ihr euer Land verraten und verkaufen an die EU?

Comment84	Kuenssberg creeps me out with her spitefulness and blatant bias.
Comment 84.1	oshawaxpress bbc favourite editor
Comment85	bias broadcasting corporation at it again I see! No attempt to hide it anymore disgraceful!
Comment86	These rich people don&#39;t care about the majority of brits, the middle class. This is not an effort to help the poor. British people should look at it from the shoes of a European. This is just another game of the wealthiest. The life of brits wont change. This is propaganda. It so clear it makes me want to hit me in my face. Wake up Brits!
Comment87	Starting to enjoy the clowny desperation... like a third grade comic story... clowns in expensive suits wasting public money... haha
Comment88	Stop blocking, just let us get out. Entitled tossers.
Comment89	Bercow boy out now!
Comment90	Before a general election the way the postal vote  is done needs amending.<br /><br />Still leaving on the 31st anyway.
Comment 90.1	@DPK12 I was born in the 70s  you grow up.
Comment 90.2	Wayne your picture is sooooo 1970&#39;s grow up
Comment 90.3	Postal vote changes and Voter ID
Comment91	They have had more then a year to plan for the depart.. Just DO IT... END
Comment92	I’m confused, is this political based or intelligence based?
Comment 92.1	Who knows? Since 2016...<br />UK: We&#39;ll vote on the thing<br />EU: OK, now-<br />UK: We also want cake!<br />EU: What? Wait, you must vote on the thing<br />UK: OK, we vote on the thing!<br />EU: Which thi-<br />UK: We voted to not vote on the thing! Extension please!<br />EU: Sigh...<br />UK: And cake!
Comment93	The BBC are embarrassingly biased towards the Tories. Why would you pay for their service just to be lied to. John Bercow is the most decent guy in there and he is being slated by this immoral bunch of scumbags, ie the BBC and the Conservative party. One and the same
Comment 93.1	John Bercow morale? Hahahaha that&#39;s a good one he repeatedly abuses MPs and now under investigation by the parliamentary select committee.
Comment94	Hello, The Queen isn’t listening to the people again. The only way we can get rid of MM, Is to band together and make the Queen listen. Like we did when Dianna died and The Queen refuse to fly the flag. MM is a threat to the Commonwealth. We want her gone.
Comment 94.1	Kanil Grace the queen refused to fly the flag because Diana was sucking a muslims cock.
Comment95	Disordeeeehly 😂😂
Comment96	Talking about voting again,  for argument seek if people voted again for leave, will it be now automatically leaving the EU or another f.. k negotiations again for another deal? Useless MP&#39;S and traitors for democracy and people who voted to leave disappointed with this big fat liars am done with them.
Comment97	The speaker is awesome. His doing his job making sure that the same amendment is voted on every chance. Like may deal they tried 3 time all failed then they tried again and was told no he is stopping unruly MPs making a vote for the same deal over and over again without changing it
Comment98	British politics at its absolute best! Its my opinion
Comment99	&quot;my name is bercow and I like cheeeeeeeese, I am the speaker, the speaker&#39;s speaker, and my wife looks more manly than I do, just about the only time I feel like a man is when I am standing  here as a speaker assisted by this great platform that makes me feel sizably bigger than every one else in the room. also, i like wearing flashy ties, it makes me feel sparkly, and in summary, I would like to say no to brexit, or I will resign tomorrow&quot; LOL
Comment100	If Bojo really wanted Brexit all he has to do is come up with a credible plan, and give time for it to be scrutinised by parliament, its normal procedure. It baffles me completely, he behaves like a spoilt little brat.
Comment 100.1	Don&#39;t be silly - the vert last thing parliament wants is a viable plan, of any sort.... Every deal will be rejected. Many MPs openly came out and said they would vote down Boris&#39;s deal before knowing anything about it.  A deal is not what they want.
Comment101	I like the bits, rather like and advert in a soap opera, where one of the labour tribe pop up as a welcome diversion to resign, claiming anti-semitism, or some other MP stands up to burst into tears about their mental health. None of them give a toss about our mental health while they carry on with their childlike charade of incompetence.
Comment102	3.30 hail..?
Comment103	The &#39;no competition clause&#39; reg alignments must come out....we don&#39;t want the level playing field. The EU don&#39;t want to  compete with us, how absurd. Are they afraid we&#39;ll do well negotiating without them? Singapore, Switzerland etc do very well without the same reg tax, trade etc alignments.
Comment104	Baker. I agree with you about those rotten  parliamentarians, need again an elections to tell the tories  once more that they are on the wrong way. May organized an elections and lost, but obviously not enough...still this kind of steve bakers in it...please, another election so we got rid of this rotten persons
Comment105	General election is the only practical option, let the people decide who we want taking us forward without the EU.
Comment 105.1	@sir Beanalot Note the conditional &quot;would&quot;. Does that answer your question?
Comment 105.2	@Martin Baldwin-Edwards why have you been to future?
Comment 105.3	a general election will solve nothing. The most likely outcome would be a hung parliament, with the Tories trying to form a minority government. In other words, the same crap as now.
Comment106	I wonder why the speaker is so biased- What is there in for him? I have my doubts here- especially after all the Rumors that are making the rounds about him. Speaker should act in National interests, be neutral and not show themselves to be biased as here clearly is the case.
Comment 106.1	Janardhan Parweshwar the guy was following the law you idiot.
Comment107	The only setback is the BBC set back from reality which is the bills being legislated this week, or has Gove has stated in Parliament yesterday, the default position of no deal Brexit will happen. I know that you Fake News like to pretend that there wasn&#39;t a referendum three years ago with a majority vote to leave and live in a delusional state of mind, but Brexit is happening.
Comment108	So Boris refuses a 2nd referendum but tried to table to motion to repeat Saturday&#39;s vote ?
Comment 108.1	Nicholas Dennant ...there was no vote on Saturday, keep up old chap
Comment109	British parliament acts as some kind of  frontal cortex for the UK. She is standing at the edge of a cliff, ready to jump fearlessly but her last bit of reason and sanity goes like &quot;wait wait, hold on, bad idea, bad idea. step back, let&#39;s talk, let&#39;s have a vote&quot;. Yes, hesitating, insecure but sane nonetheless.
Comment110	All these years, and all these millions of tax payers money, and all these lies, all this coercive media manipulation, all a bid by billionaires to shaft the working majority, the true creators of wealth and builders of infrastructure. Propaganda used in its fullest to sell ordinary people their own demise.<br /><br />And people think that this is about democracy and the &quot;will of the people&quot;.  Wow. People talk about this as an episodic saga, yet miss the actual plot-line. <br /><br />Incredible.
Comment 110.1	The same thing happens in Brazil.<br /><br />Socialism and collectivism are two powerful alienating tools.
Comment111	Just to think, people were told (and some even still believe) that EVERYTHING was/is going to be &#39;BETTER&#39;. What a complete and utter charade; built upon a pack of outright lies and fantasy. Unicorns and tooth fairies spring to mind.
Comment 111.1	@SAHBfan Who?
Comment 111.2	​@Abominable Snowman Exactly. Infact, the ability to seize this &quot;control&quot; (as brexiters seem to believe is a possibility) would be impossible, thanks to our sovereignty (which is ours regardless of EU membership) and our parliamentary system (without which, ironically you wouldn&#39;t have been given a referendum in the first place. The very parliament  BJ attempted to silence/prorogue incase you still believe brexit is on your side). For both our sakes, I truly hope reality is starting to sink in. Nigel Farage is not your friend. Neither is any remain candidate but I can absolutely guarantee, without a shred of uncertainty, Brexit has nothing to offer either of us. But, your choice. Regards
Comment 111.3	@Dog Nuts  <br />I can agree that Britain will not cede control over our &quot;defence&quot; to Brussels...
Comment 111.4	@Barry Allen - Ed Milliband said the same thing. Maybe it was his lie you fell for?
Comment112	So it’s a failure again for Mr Johnson but the speaker is failing the people
Comment 112.1	Bercow could be described in many ways, none of them complimentary. He is a remainer who has done everything in his power (and he has way too much of that), to sabotage every attempt to facilitate a leaving strategy. He is certainly a self-opinionated twerp of the highest (or is that the lowest) order of twerpiness.
Comment113	One of the series writers just tweeted &quot;just as our fans thought this season ends it all,<br />A whole new season in the works, stay tuned&quot;.

Comment115	So much corruption and bias.
Comment 115.1	Its sickening British are getting weak... Just Leave the EU, it is a good thing.
Comment116	N&#39;awww, is it harder than you thought Boris? Is it actually serious and dangerous business Boris? Poor little BJ, it&#39;s hard isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s not just like the rest of your life, privilege and money.
Comment 116.1	Thats your argument? Its hard so lets not bother? The easy choice is usualy the wrong and least fulfilling choice.
Comment117	Our parliament is full of anti democratic traitors and Bercow is the worst traitor of them all.

Comment 118.2	Who needs experts. Democracy is not about boring facts anymore, it&#39;s about who can play the public best. The truth would obviously just get in the way. What we need is democracy 2.0 in which all voters are well educated so they can smell populistic BS from a mile away. We need decent press who tells the public all the relevant facts in the right order so when a referendum is held, they can make a decision based on the truth as we understand it. The government needs to invest in education for the next 80 years for this measure to fully implement and ever after to maintain it. Pay for it by increasing taxes mainly on those who benefit from a well educated workforce.
Comment119	Selfish MP
Comment120	We had The Vote! Its just that Britain isn&#39;t a Democracy any longer!
Comment 120.1	Todays Freelancer It’s the people who are sovereign 406 constituencies voted leave compared to 242 that voted remain yet most mps are banging on for remain they’re not doing what they’ve been elected to do and will be voted out in the next GE and replaced by a parliament that will.
Comment 120.2	@Craig Smith regardless of how you interpret it, it&#39;s how the UK parliamentary democracy works. Parliament is sovereign and the sovereign Parliament is doing what they&#39;ve been elected to do lol
Comment 120.3	Todays Freelancer Wouldn’t call parliament holding the country hostage and giving more control to a foreign power democracy in action.
Comment 120.4	This IS democracy in action, no?
Comment 120.5	Barry Allen 😂😂😂😂😆😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Comment121	What a farce! I don&#39;t blame Boris for not signing that letter! I wouldn&#39;t want to put my name to that document. Boris can go down in history as not being an adversary of The British People! Mr. Bercow! will clearly go down in history as a traitor and an egoist!

Comment123	it is not a deal it&#39;s a treaty?
Comment 123.1	At the moment it is a deal, it won&#39;t become a treaty until it is formally concluded, and ratified by the EU and the House of Lords.

Comment127	Brexit Now give Angela the British boot cheers.
Comment 127.1	Its Angela that has given you the boot you fool or rather manipulated a very stupid  uneducated English population  into  a situation where the  commit economic suicide . Well done the Germans
Comment128	I&#39;m a rocket nerd of long standing (60 Years) and I can&#39;t help but feel like we have launch fever in the House of Commons. LF has led to 14 deaths during the Space Shuttle Era, and I don&#39;t want to see this happen to the sick, poor and elderly. There will be many who will die during the uncertainty period. Austerity - Quantitative Easing, on the their backs, has left them knackered and hanging by a hair; the 1% will cheerfully cut that thread and dump them into the grave, if it would give them a tax break or a bump in their stock/bond/hedge fund portfolios. Better to buy shares in a company that makes torches, pitch forks and yellow vests. That seems to be the future of Europe.
Comment 128.1	If NASA had a rocket fuelled up and sat on the launch pad for three and a half years people would have asked questions.  It didn&#39;t take them much longer to send a man to the moon.  It&#39;s time to light this candle.
Comment129	John Bercow as a waiter: hi can I take your ooooordaaaaaah!!!!
Comment 129.1	There is nothing funny about that little poisonous dwarf
Comment 129.2	@mgc7199 that&#39;s a very good one.👍greetings from the Netherlands.
Comment 129.3	Customer: &#39;Waiter, there is a fly in my soup.&#39;<br />Bercow: &#39;The honerable customer is experienced and dextrous enough to remove the fly himself, if he so wish.&#39; &#39;The point, though well made, was not for the house to solve.&#39;<br />Customer: &#39;How rude!&#39;<br />Bercow: &#39;Ordah!&#39;<br />Customer: &#39;One tomato soup, hold the fly!&#39;
Comment130	kick NI and Scotland out! LEAVE MEANS LEAVE!
Comment 130.1	When I wrote about the 2014 referendum for my BA thesis I added a tiny PS in the conclusion, saying this issue will come up if there is ever a referendum on EU membership ... Guess I was right<br />I also predicted DevoMax won&#39;t be given to Scotland and will be a broke promise by Westminster ... Guess what happened? Exactly that<br />Maybe I should start playing the lottery?
Comment 130.2	How about England and Wales leave the UK and Scotland and NI stay as the successor state of the UK inside the EU? That would be the best solution.
Comment 130.3	Making false promisses means making false promisses. Paying a company called Cambridge Analytica to create fake ads on Facebook to make people scared of immigrants means...well, you got the idea...
Comment 130.4	Kick Northern Ireland and Scotland out !!! Get writing to that fat prick Johnson and tell him Scotland wants to leave the shitty UK..no need to kick anyone out..we&#39;d glady leave...bye
Comment 130.5	Yeah, please leave. Now. Shoo. And leave your great nation alone.
Comment131	BBC why don&#39;t you like democracy?
Comment 131.1	When England win the world cup they&#39;re going to vote against there ever being another one.we won, that&#39;s it! Over! No more!
Comment 131.2	Why don&#39;t you like rational decision-making?
Comment132	The next general election in the United Kingdom is scheduled for 5 May 2022, five years after the previous general election in 2017.<br />The election is expected to occur earlier however, sometime in late 2019. Wikipedia<br /><br /><br />PM Farage
Comment 132.1	Please don&#39;t take offence to this, but that would be far, far worse than Boris, and Boris is a bad PM
Comment133	They will  leave on the 31 october 2019, part of reinstating the divine energy behind the british people. not much will change if we leave the EU or not
Comment134	Nigel farrage for pm the Brexit party is the only people who will give UK its complete freedom from the dictatorship Eu
Comment 134.1	Si Dog Ducati what&#39;s your point, and why was the vote repeated and repeated plus Boris Johnson Brexit is worse then May&#39;s deal... Listen to the Brexit party
Comment 134.2	So if the EU is s dictatorship and I assume you think they dont want us to leave then why have we been going thru all this bollocks for the last few years.  There wouldnt have been a vote in the first place
Comment135	Y vote on something that is d same... pointless.

Comment 137.1	Funny you mention it, I totally forgot he is showing right now how much he cares for his country and it&#39;s allies (aka not at all)
Comment 137.2	daryl H they won&#39;t wake up they won&#39;t 😂
Comment138	I&#39;d love to see Parliament vote on something that they like and then bring it to the EU and watch it get voted  down and sent back to Parliament to do it over again and again
Comment 138.1	@Janusha . Nothing is what many people want. Many of us don&#39;t want a deal with any ties to the EU, just to leave in a clean break. We are embarrassed for the behaviour of some MP&#39;s that have no interest in democracy.
Comment 138.2	@John <br />The Brits have no cards in this game. They will take whats on offer or leave with nothing. Those are the options. Unless they decide to stay, ofcourse. Which would be the sensible thing to do. This has been a massive embarrassment for the UK, hasnt it.
Comment 138.3	@Janusha . He already has . The EU refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement or remove the backstop arrangement , but they have.
Comment 138.4	The Brits seem to think they have cards to play in this game. The EU has made their stand when they first talked to Theresa May. To the EU, nothing has changed since. And Boris isnt going to change that.
Comment 138.5	Bercow is brilliant
Comment139	ORDEEEEER. OOOORDER !!!! They have accomplished NOTHING the last 6 months. Britain will crash and burn out of the EU. They will take whatever is on offer or leave with no deal. This has been clear for a while now.
Comment 139.1	Janusha we do send £350 million every week though don’t we and have been for about 40 years, that’s about £728 billion now you might say yeah but we get some of that back, actually we get just under half of it back in the form of grants distributed to various projects and infrastructure, so when you say the Eu payed for things in this country it was actually our own money and we paid twice as much for the privilege, a strange setup I’m sure you would agree doesn’t really make sense to pay double for our own infrastructure and projects.<br />So when the house wife who voted to leave the Eu because we pay double for everything she is actually right.<br />Now I’m pretty sure your housewife little story didn’t vote leave to stop all immigration but to have immigration control, you see the difference is uncontrolled mass immigration ie free mass movement which puts a massive strain on infrastructure, public services like hospitals, housing and jobs and controlled immigration ie our country deciding who comes in and who doesn’t, based on a points scheme similar to Australia I believe.<br />To insinuate that 17.4 million people of the U.K. who voted to leave are all racist is disingenuous at the very least.
Comment 139.2	@Dale Smith <br />Because the flagwaving bewildered masses are uninformed on trade deals, international commerce and politics. They vote on commpletely arbitrary stuff. Shit like... Will gas for my car or cigarettes be 50p cheaper for me, then yes... Lets leave the EU. But its not cigarettes that made people vote. Its the same as always. Keeping immigrants out. And the notion that leaving EU will make that easier. Which is utter bullshit. <br /><br />Brexit... Is Britains Donald Trump.
Comment 139.3	Dale Smith I don’t, the people have already voted and that wasn’t honoured so what’s the point of another vote, it will just be ignored again and if it isn’t then we should have a third vote as the decisive vote but then if  the minority aren’t happy with that vote what about a fourth and final vote.<br />But then you have to have a fifth vote to actually have a winner, but then again.<br />And so it goes, on and on😂😂😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️<br />Tell me what circumstances have changed specifically?
Comment 139.4	why do you not want a peoples vote?
Comment140	Some say Bercow is a traitor, he wasn&#39;t one of the people who voted for crashing the UK economy.
Comment141	The ending of this drama is way more dramatic than Game of Thrones.
Comment 141.1	It&#39;s going to be equally disappointing.
Comment 141.2	Previous month I was able to withdraw my first five figure check ever!!! I&#39;ve been working for this provider online for 2 yrs now and I never been happier... They are paying me $95 per hour, and the most desirable thing about that is the fact that I am not really that tech-savvy, they just required standard idea of internet and plain typing skill...Superb thing about this gig is that now I have more free time for my loved ones. I am in a position to dedicate quality time with my friends and family and take care of my children and also going on family holiday together with them very often.

Comment143	Hilary Benn, Oliver Letwin, Anna Soubry, traitors all.
Comment 143.1	@Barry Allen you mean like what&#39;s expected to happen should the No Deal that Boris and JRM are salivating to occur? You do know that everytime there&#39;s a possibility of No Deal the £ drops and the likes of Crispin Odey and JRM profit. They are literally profiting of the misery of Brexit after pumping £millions into the Leave campaign.. Odey made £300 million on the night of the referendum, while the drop in the £ has caused the cost of living for the poorest to go up significantly.
Comment 143.2	Traitors? Are Benn, Letwin and Soubry prepared to throw the British Economy under a bus?
Comment 143.3	True patriots, maybe you don’t understand the British political system but Parliament is sovereign, they have been lent power from the citizens and have a duty to ensure that the voice of the people is heard and acted upon. There is no mandate from the Leave referendum to place borders within the UK, the fact you would want that makes me doubt your patriotism...

Comment 144.2	Your an idiot if you think Parliament is democratic. The first past the post system means that many votes are not counted. It needs proportional representation. The referendaum is democratic as all votes count.
Comment 144.3	@jordan Wingnuts: Vote for corrupt right wing extremist liars who are just out to make themselves richer shorting the pound into the dirt and slashing your paychecks for their profits.<br />Wingnuts: Damn migrants, coming here, taking our jobs, wrecking our economy.
Comment 144.4	@robobertob true though.

Comment150	This is what taking back control looks like. MPs who can’t agree on anything, but disagreeing.
Comment151	Any so-called people&#39;s vote will be met with a people&#39;s boycott. Why on earth would any leave voter participate to give legitimacy to a second vote, with clearly a rigged question, when the first referendum result was not implemented?<br /><br />Any second vote would produce a farcical result of say 90 percent or higher remain win with a paltry 35% or less turn-out(comprising almost entirely of remain voters) after a boycott in the millions of leave voters. Thus this heavily boycotted vote, with such a low turn-out, should have no democratic legitimacy as a mandate to reverse the 2016 result.<br /><br />Running a second referendum,  before implementing the result of the first referendum, is utterly undemocratic. It is never a wise thing for stability and peace in a democratic society, for the electorate to realize that their votes are treated with such utter contempt and completely ignored. Trust in democracy would be completely broken for millions of the electorate.With their vote disregarded in such a way, why would they ever wish to vote again? Is that a society we wish to live In?
Comment 151.1	Stephen breeze Leave voters will vote. ALL OF THEM.

Comment 153.4	@jordan We await the next GE and the slaughter of the lambs yeah
Comment154	You can vote on various versions of the deal if you want. But to suggest you can amend the negotiated with EU bill and the original deal no longer exists to vote on it along with an additional vote on newly modified bill is hogwash.
Comment 154.1	Whatever they vote on and agree to if it goes back to the EU they&#39;re going to vote against it regardless of how similar it might be to the early agreed to document, out of spite

Comment 156.4	@Wendy O silly person.
Comment157	I think John Bercow lost the right to make a fair judgement after showing bias at Boris Johnson first Prorogation. John Bercow wishes to block the government from moving forward and he knows Boris doesn&#39;t have long on the clock to get his Brexit agreement through... so for John it&#39;s about siding with the rebels to cause delay.

Comment 162.4	Its entertaining, but best....not so much.
Comment163	I thought that Johnson withdrew the brexit deal vote after the Letwin amendment passed. So how can Bercow block it from being voted on a second time when it wasn&#39;t even voted on a first time? This is the only thing so far I don&#39;t understand.
Comment 163.1	He&#39;s blocking debate and discussion by blocking the motion (proposal)
Comment 163.2	It&#39;s the letwin amendment he wanted to bring back and vote on again.
Comment164	BREXIT IS CAUSE OF THE ROYAL BRITISH ESTABLISHMENT ,HOW COME UK IS A DEMOCRACY?

Comment 164.5	@Col Bingo WHO HAS LIVED WITH UK DEMOCRACY ,APPARENTLY U GUYS ARE DRAAWN IN ILLUSION OF NATIONAL  PRIDE , SO THAT YOU ARE MESSING UP A COLONIST RACIST STATE WITH A DEMOCRACY
Comment165	Bercow is definitely impartial in his role as a speaker..he is an anti Brexit and destroy democracy. He is a traitor..
Comment 165.1	You’re the traitor for going against parliamentary customs and traditions
Comment166	Another referendum? Undemocratic!<br />Another deal vote? Democratic!<br /><br /><br />Brextremist logic.
Comment167	I don’t think Anna Soubry understands the implications of an EU withdraw act and the negotiations set on terms with the European Union. Once the article 50 was triggered. The U.K. was given a deadline by which they were meant to agree to a withdrawal act that would formally settle any disputes the individual governments had over the logistics of the U.K. leaving the EU. This standard is in good faith with the European Union. The EU is for all intents and purposes allowed to withdrawal support of the deal making process at the end of their deadline. They are not obligated to support another Brexit delay. It’s been three and a half years!  If there is no clear way to the approval of a Brexit deal, they have every right to walk away from the negotiating table. Boris Johnson is right in warning the U.K. Parliament of the EU’s intentions. There may not be anymore deadlines and if you act as though they are guaranteed, you are heading for a tough time.
Comment 167.1	Wagoo I would caution your presumption that the U.K. would consider withdrawing Article 50 as an act to extend the consideration period on a deal. The likely outcome would be no Brexit altogether. However, it is true the E.U. would not want a no deal. We can only wait to see what comes next.
Comment 167.2	It&#39;s in their interests to extend as no-deal would damage both sides, however if they get sick of the UK and refuse the UK can still just withdraw article 50 if it needs more time
Comment 167.3	"Truck Taxi I would presume that, if by the deadline on October the 31st the U.K. has shown no signs in ratifying Boris’s deal or any deal that can be brought forward and agreed to by the EU, the EU will refuse an extension and the U.K. will leave at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKomPaKjbB0&amp;t=11m00s"">11:00</a> on that date. This will occur if no deal is reached. Perhaps, if a proposal to the EU by Boris Johnson himself is made, the EU could oblige to a limited extension in order to have it ratified by the EU member states. The reality is no one knows what could happen in the next ten days. We didn’t know a second deal could be reached until this month. All possibilities are still on the table. There is talk of a general election, but that is on the basis the EU will permit an extension for such a period of time. Boris Johnson may opt for one if his deal can’t make it through parliament so to break the parliamentary numbers and receive a mandate from the people. All told we will see."
Comment 167.4	So what happens if the EU walks away from the negotiating table does that mean that UK&#39;s in or does it mean that they are automatically out without a deal?
Comment168	We need another referendum
Comment169	Leave means leave.
Comment 169.1	@Noises name calling. Why am I not surprised? The people voted to leave. The parliament doesn’t want to or if there is a break for it to fail. They should have accepted May’s deal and left well. The EU should not have given an extension. Free Ireland while you are at it.
Comment 169.2	Three Word Slogans!<br />Three Word Slogans!<br />(because right wingers are too stupid to remember any more words.)

Comment173	What&#39;s wrong with black men?
Comment174	not to worry, some business is already leave UK, so don&#39;t worry
Comment 174.1	@stevkyt thats exactly right people who have studied this EU project in great detail have come to the conclusion that maintaining economic stability let alone any growth in gdp across many different economies under one  static frame work the EU imposes is just catastrophic to each member, let alone the fact we only signed up for access to the free trade block in the first place not to surrender our governance to a foreign body unaccountable to the UK people and if anyone wants to know how that happened research Jean Monnet and then you can understand the foundation of this Union, and its not so pure motives lol sorry steve not all that was ment to be a reply to you i had a rant lol :)
Comment 174.2	@ERNESERNES i didnt say that i was merely stating a fact
Comment 174.3	@ERNESERNES The EU economy is spiralling downwards. Best to leave the sinking ship now. You&#39;ll only become a millionaire if you strive to become one, not wait for free money, you scrounger.
Comment 174.4	John Read Lol, sure. I bet everyone in this country will be a billionaire if the uk leaves the EU.
Comment 174.5	well thats nothing to worry about as there is a mass of investment waiting to enter the UK come deal or no deal
Comment175	bbc... no bias here then.
Comment176	Kings,Queens  and the House of Lords ....no democracy in that country ...😂😂😂😂 Engalnd is the E.U.s bit@h....
Comment 176.1	Just a monarchy, we waiting on the King of Kings Lord of Lord&#39;s.
Comment177	If the government were acting appropriately, he wouldn&#39;t have so many opportunities to appear biased by simply doing his normal job. He&#39;s having to remind the government of how to behave properly on a daily basis. He looks biased because they&#39;re trying to take the piss.
Comment178	uk...it&#39;s not only your relation to the EU...it&#39;s your relation to the world!
Comment 178.1	@Matthew Witherspoon fasten your seatbelt
Comment 178.2	Most of the world hates the EU and loves the UK. Do you think people like Germans or French? No other EU countries even matter. Texas and California are richer and bigger than most countries in the EU, you people are so arrogant its pathetic.
Comment179	You can tell the BBC doesn&#39;t want brexi just watch Newsnight
Comment180	Why arnt these public servants not acting on the will of the people? 17.4million people voted to leave the eu with no deal. Where is the democracy?
Comment 180.1	@Leon Fuller no i send you to your local dentist for good reason with best regards.
Comment 180.2	@Impeach the orange Clown and what you gunna do clown? Go and cry to your mummy soy boy
Comment 180.3	@Leon Fuller Top quality troll, well done my son. Capitalized ACCEPT and still spells it wrong, hilarious.
Comment181	Ann Soubry made great speech...
Comment182	Johnson is a child just like bloody trump 😂😂
Comment183	Conservatives are a fraud. Supported by a fraudulent DUP. Nigel farage and his listeners want “independence” yet Northern Ireland, Scotland can’t have a say it’s like England trying to bring back some sort of monarchy and they are in control of everything. Yet slandering the EU that they don’t get enough say. England has had too much control for my liking.<br /><br />Gets uncomfortable watching these puppets in their chamber, heckling and shouting at each other like an upper class rap battle. England doesn’t care about Ireland north or south, Scotland left in the dust. So many brainwashed supporters of the union. The union is dead, the world is a different place and governments need to look after themselves locally. Brexit will ruin life in many places apart from the Rich boroughs of England and wealthy families who fund these farcical party agendas for their narrow minded views. <br /><br />It’s going to be tits up for the UK and they only have themselves to blame
Comment 183.1	@Brandon Mattix some of the victors ended up owing millions to the US and losing virtually all of its empire. I wonder who that could be. You call me a moron while at the same time talking complete an utter shite.
Comment 183.2	@Ron P a debate on ww2 whats to debate the allies won and nazi germany was defeated.
Comment 183.3	@Ron P im the fool yet you support a mass murderer yeah ok so.
Comment 183.4	@Ron P says the man with hitler videos on his account lol.
Comment184	Actions speak louder then words. Boris just published his Brexit bill for mps to debate tomorrow and vote on Thursday,  he had all the time to even shut the parliament but wants now no time for mps to study his Brexit . His actions says it all of what he Boris really wants. Clean Brexit for his billionaires backers .

Comment187	The corruption that comes out of that building is disgusting....and i thought Cambodia was bad
Comment188	👍
Comment189	Ann Soubry resists “ rushing parliament toward a hasty decision” re Brexit deal. Three years it has taken to get to a state of impasse. The repair of Notre Dame may take less time , perhaps even the original building time. English politics must always be followed from “ a sedentary, even prone position”, makes my poor heart virtually race.
Comment 189.1	Three years? You know that they only got the document the night before, do you? It&#39;s like you&#39;ve been searching for a house for three years and suddenly they give you a contract of a house you just saw and ask you to sign it immediately
Comment190	This season of Brexit has too many twists it&#39;s insane. Even the twists have twists
Comment 190.1	@James Bennett The Brexiteers - Season 4
Comment 190.2	Nope - it is just one big maelstrom.
Comment 190.3	“Honourable and fair” is not how I would describe the current Speaker. Every time he utters the word “order”,  he makes my blood boil. It is not the word, it is his sanctimonious tone. Hardly an unbiased Speaker.
Comment 190.4	@Uldis Crystal ikr
Comment191	Mister speaker is he nigerian or english man. Odeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Comment192	Is our democracy under attack from globalists?
Comment 192.1	@Matthew Witherspoon Y&#39;all are amermexicunts
Comment 192.2	Yall have a monarchy, thats your first problem.
Comment193	He&#39;s ruining business he&#39;s just a rich kid
Comment194	Anything the left can do to postpone the will of the people
Comment 194.1	-- So, the ‘people’ are ~66-67 million. Minus those ineligible due to minor status (under 18) and other categories. That equals total eligible electorate. Minus non-turnout. Minus 48.1% of that (with a healthy portion of the 51.9% being unlawfully misled). And you claim the result of all this is the ‘will of the people’??? Laughable. Stop emoting, start thinking.
Comment195	I thought if you vote for Brexit. It’s a done deal. Why is the process taking so long? Is a vote not worth anything anymore?
Comment 195.1	@Martin Webb you sound so delusional, but the fact is you are absolutely right and I fiercely agree with everything you said.
Comment 195.2	+ SPEAK UP ... A vote has never been worth anything, its just to keep the masses believing they have a choice, freedom doesn&#39;t exist ... try and stop paying your taxes you&#39;ll soon see how free you really are ... we are all slaves each of us has a slave number, slavery was never really abolished they just changed it. Different parties same bullshit ... freedom is just an illusion, divide and conquer is how they keep control of the masses, Brexit is just the latest illusion to keep us all divided.
Comment 195.3	@liberalmatt it&#39;s like one guy I was just discussing with. He thinks in order for Brexit to be done, they need elections. I politely told him it still needs to pass the Parliament. He didn&#39;t accept it well. These people don&#39;t even understand the basics of the basics. They even ignore it&#39;s their own conservative party who is blocking a deal because they want out the hard way.
Comment 195.4	And exactly WHICH Brexit are you after? Life - and politics - is not binary
Comment 195.5	you&#39;re such a tosser even a salad would be jealous
Comment196	Make Boris great again and vote for his fantastic deal he have for Northern Ireland
Comment197	Pedo leader of the house is afraid to have democracy, they will be without andrrnochrome, not allowed these Saville child blood worshipers will loose.
Comment198	It&#39;s time for the British pubic to vote again on whether or not they wish to leave the EU now that the people are much more aware of the pros and cons.
Comment 198.1	Mark Green - ah, but they don’t want an electorate that knows what it’s voting for.
Comment 198.2	no it isnt
Comment199	Just revoke the bloody thing and move on!
Comment200	John Bercow absolutely adores the sound of his own voice, a voice that will not be missed by many when he leaves as Speaker of the House this month ( I hope) . He has demonstrated obvious bias particularly towards those inclined to be Remainers in the Brexit debacle.<br />No speaker should allow himself or be permitted to show such predilection.
Comment 200.1	He&#39;s viral, dumbass. He&#39;ll be missed - just not by you.
Comment201	Parliament refuses to accept &quot;No Deal&quot;.<br />Parliament refuses to accept the offered deal.<br />Parliament refuses to come up with a better deal.<br />                      ... does anyone else think that a General Election is long overdue?
Comment 201.1	@Blahdy Blah <br />Must be an Indian
Comment 201.2	@Drako-shi Look at the polls. The Tories are set to win a solid majority, along with the Brexit Party getting another 10% or so of the vote. Labour&#39;s actions and policies have damaged their reputation, and i genuinely believe that they will suffer in the next election. That&#39;s why the opposition benches clamoured for an election when May was Prime Minister (because the odds looked good for them), but have shied away since Boris took the reins because the polls have been pretty consistently in the Tories&#39; favour ever since - giving them a lead of up to 15% in some cases. Given our voting system, that could lead to a massive majority under the right circumstances.<br /><br />The Lib Dems are out of the race. Their anti-brexit stance won&#39;t be enough to get them into power, and their downward spiral towards socialism isn&#39;t helping them either. The polls seem to reflect this.<br /><br />As i say, i know that the referendum wasn&#39;t <b>legally</b> binding, and parliament still has to approve it (although it <b>has</b> approved it by triggering Article 50). However, openly opposing the result of the referendum is political suicide. No party with any sense would defy the results of a democratic vote, even if the option is technically available to them. Ergo, the Lib Dems have no sense.<br /><br />I think the Tories also want to preserve and create jobs. Boris has been openly supportive of putting more money towards the police, NHS, defence, fisheries, and so on - all things which would create jobs. <br />A potential trade deal with the US is just a bonus - and why wouldn&#39;t it be? Mutually-beneficial trade deals are good for both economies.<br /><br />Also, stop trying to insult me. We&#39;re not in high school any more.
Comment 201.3	@Drako-shi  Drako-shi  if corbyns job is as you describe he&#39;ll lose the election to promote the economy. Economic forecasts predict hed be worse than no deal Brexit. He needs to challenege the economic outlook and yet he bangs their drum. I know he is anti-EU, but hes not a leader hes following and as a result lost a large section of the vote. <br />You ask too many easily answered questions. The UK is a hotspot for FDI and has 15 or so of the best universities in the world, good security services and military. While having it&#39;s own currency it has control of its monetary policy, which is a big advantage. If no deal occured a trade deal would be mutually beneficial and sorted sharpish. Bojo has demonstrated this fact already.<br />The rest of your post really isn&#39;t worth responding to as it&#39;s not really reality based. You can call China and USA out for self interests but not the eu. Go explain that to the dubbed pigs nations it threw under a bus to protect its banking sector, which has been a disaster itself. Corbyn wont call it out either. The eu has lost severe ground in terms of economy to the USA Russia China and the other bric nations. Its performed poorly and its root cause is it&#39;s own Express want the euro and ever closer union. <br />Merkel in 2010 and again in 2014 said the same things Farage has about multiculturalism. They dont go back, they dont integrate, live in separate communities and dont learn the language. But shes not called a nazi or racist. <br />The problems of immigration are age old, there is a balance to be struck in this regard. You do not want to provoke ethnonationailst sentiments. UK via immigration &amp; rotherham et al has done this to some extent and we see similar in Germany. Again poor management and understanding which is the hallmark of the last era of politicians.
Comment 201.4	@CCTV 1984 Corbyn is doing exactly what he has to do. Although he respects the referendum and he doesn&#39;t oppose Brexit (in fact years ago he was opposing EU long before conservatives) he is representing the labour party and he can&#39;t defraud his base...it would be irresponsible for the labour party to not care about their main reason for existence in the first place...secure british people jobs. Those will be at risk no matter what you say it what conservatives say. Can you imagine the number of small and medium companies which their income will be greatly affected for not having EU to export their goods? Which markets will you be looking for? USA? Will USA accept all your exports? How much will it cost for transportation? And you seriously believe USA will be importing the share you were exporting to all EU countries without you importing some of USA goods to balance the trade? Which markets will be affected? Will USA import your beef? I don&#39;t think so. They gave plenty. Clearly you people didn&#39;t think this through and you are just reacting to a trend created by USA to destroy EU...bash EU. You see, if EU doesn&#39;t exist neither China will have access to our market but also USA can deal with each country in way much better conditions. When they have to deal with Luxembourg out Belgium, they have to deal with EU. It&#39;s no secret Trump is an EU enemy and that Boris, Farage, Salvini and Le Pen (all alleged far-right or aggressive nationalist populists) have the end of EU as their top priority. All met with Trump before he was elected and all were funded by him and his buddies. Look, I&#39;m tired of this. People are just too stupid and ignore things that jump into their eyes. USA dies not want the best for UK. They want the best for them.  In fact I want UK to leave without a deal. Why? Because that will force EU to not deal with UK and that means EU won&#39;t be importing from UK and what UK is allowed to export to EU they&#39;ll have to pay tariffs. It&#39;s a punishment and I think UK deserves it. EU will be weaker but UK will struggle really hard. Companies and factories will close. Those companies being helped by EU funds...closed. we are talking probably of millions of jobs. Not to mention that other companies will prefer to move to EU because it&#39;s cheaper to play tariffs for UK than to EU. UK and USA want to play hard...we can play game. Bring it on!
Comment 201.5	@Drako-shi they can negotiate the deal after they are gone. If they leave then they will be in a better position to negotiate as well. The US isnt in the EU and we have plenty of trade with europe
Comment202	Bercow is one of very few fine people left in that room

Comment 206.2	@Martin Webb Honest Boris?, ha ha ah, not even his own party trust him. He has a life long track record of lies and bullshit

Comment216	So pleased we have an honest Speaker who knows what the rules are and has the courage to enact them. Boris the Liar is going to fail.
Comment 216.1	@Wendy O oh no! Someone disagrees with you so they must be on drugs.
Comment 216.2	What drugs are you on?
Comment 216.3	Matthew Witherspoon shut up you fool
Comment 216.4	Matthew Witherspoon Shut your mouth fool
Comment 216.5	You&#39;re a fuckin worthless traitor
Comment217	Hes such a show boat.  Hope these abuse allegations effect his lords seat.
Comment 217.1	‘Affect’, not ‘effect’. Typical...
Comment 217.2	Its literally the normal thing to do
Comment218	hopefully the investigation against the speaker bares fruit as his blatant remain point of view is directly effecting and influencing his role as speaker and is unacceptable and as for frustrating the government in this clear attempt to cancel our withdrawal all together because that is clearly the end destination for opposition if the EU does not accept an extension it falls to the default position which as the law states is that we leave with no agreement on the 31st of October and all these main stream media dont seem to understand is that there are 3 sides in this, the government, the EU and the opposition, its all well n good the opposition claiming to have the interest of the people at the forefront of there decisions, which clearly isnt the case in my opinion but putting up blocks and bills and even going to the EU themselves and interfering in diplomatic process which frankly is disgusting behavior and does not champion the will of the people of the UK in fact it has the opposite effect in that it increases the likelihood of a no deal exit which apparently means the UK will explode in a Armageddon like fashion, which of course is non sense, if you ask the majority of the country what they voted for it wasnt about the money, the most remainers voted for the status quo and most of the leavers voted for control over uk laws uk territory and to control the flood of migrants entering this country willy nilly, if you notice theres no mention of economics or anything of that nature an as for trade we are Great Britain a global leader in standards you think the EU made us that? no of course not we made us that and infact our standards are even higher than EU countries so dont tell me that because we are leaving the political project of the EU that we cant manage on our own because its utter rubbish
Comment 218.1	@liberalmatt yes the pattern is that i am grateful for your corrections but they are not entirely necessary as people can understand the general context of what im saying. thank you
Comment 218.2	‘Bears fruit’, not ‘bares fruit’. I sense a pattern here...
Comment 218.3	John Read ‘affecting’ not ‘effecting’. How very typical... and not at all surprising.
Comment219	who the fuck does he think he is ?!
Comment220	We need to rip the cancer out by the roots
Comment221	Bercow is now the dictator of the house, not the speaker of it.
Comment 221.1	@Matt Chew 😒
Comment 221.2	Blue Jay congratulations on knowing how time works 👏🏻 next week we will learn the ABCs
Comment 221.3	@Matt Chew about 3 and a half years. And yes looking back on history is a very good thing do that too.
Comment 221.4	So you’re saying that if we remember back long enough even Adolf Hitler was a nice polite young man who would help old ladies cross the road? Should we remember him that way as he only had 5 years where he was bad right? Time changes things, if you can’t see that then maybe you shouldn’t be leaving stupid comments.
Comment 221.5	Please remember this man was the same man that also allowed parliament to have the debate to have brexit to begin with.<br /><br />Its a hard to say what your saying if hes one of the main people who allowed brexit to even begin please have a memory longer then the most recent news youve seen.
Comment222	Gunpower, treason and plot.

Comment 222.2	I wouldnt mind an effigy of Bercow on a bonfire.
Comment223	House of Commons Speaker is a cuckboy traitor.
Comment224	Make Bercow great again
Comment 224.1	@Drako-shi Yes he is a fine gentleman indeed. I would like to hear a debate with Mogg and him. The best wordsmiths in parlament
Comment 224.2	He&#39;s the only trustworthy inside that junkyard.
Comment225	No deal lol this month keeps getting better and better
Comment226	This is effing treasonous!!! He is denying the will of the people.
Comment 226.1	@liberalmatt should be a comma after wouldn&#39;t of, typical I still part of the same subject previous sentence, typical... 😜
Comment 226.2	Jordon wouldn’t HAVE, not wouldn’t OF. Typical...
Comment 226.3	JogBird - he’s just upholding the rules of parliament.
Comment 226.4	was he treasonous, when he allows for mps to debate and have a vote on a referendum, 3 years ago before brexit happened. Yes it was cameron that called it, but if it wasn&#39;t for him it wouldn&#39;t of happened either way
Comment 226.5	So is Boris, his deal would mean we don&#39;t really leave either
Comment227	Good news
