Comment6	the Never Trump, Never Brexit, Feminist tyranny station
Comment7	O wow, another moral panic designed to halt the progress of technology? I&#39;m suprised.<br /><br />If deepfakes are such a big problem, what about photo and audio editing? What about biased reporting? Or violent videogames?  Or expilicit music lyrics? Or lude books? Its the same thing over and over. Maybe cover something that is a real problem, not create panics over nothing. Thats why nobody trusts or likes mainstream media anymore.<br /><br />Still waiting on the news about Prince Andrew molesting toddlers with Epstein. I wonder why no one talks about that...
Comment8	They should match the movements of the vagina with the movements of the subject&#39;s mouth in subtle manner to make it more believable.
Comment9	No way, the BBC are criticising some fake news, I never laughed so much
Comment10	‚ÄúShe‚Äù has deep faked being female ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Comment13	How about bella just does it to save them the effort...
Comment14	So people wanna create fake video of fake people (Actress)?
Comment15	You shouldn&#39;t have trusted online images to begin with. Maybe this will sober us up a little to the propaganda and misinformation online. I strongly oppose limits to freedom of expression over deep-fakes. It&#39;s bad, but so is protected hate-speech.
Comment16	In support of RT! I would like to inform you all, that the BBC is entirely funded by the British Government!
Comment17	Dont regulate knowledge thats insane
Comment18	Is She doing porn now or not?
Comment19	The same dudes jerking off to deepfakes of Bella Thorne are the same dudes jerking it to her newly directed porno.  That broad is dumb.  Or at least she didn&#39;t sound very intelligent on Stern.
Comment20	Like the Syrian chemical attack the BBC got caught faking. Lies and propaganda.
Comment 20.1	@skill centre Don&#39;t breed will you.
Comment 20.2	Dude you need to stop watching RT - it is not the BBC saying that Russia used chemical agents in Syria. It is the inspection teams thicky.
Comment21	Fake and crap like the BBC...Where&#39;s my refund?
Comment 21.1	The is no refund policy. You can watch bbc if you want.
Comment22	spoiler DON&#39;T put naked photos of yourself on the net its not a great idea üôÑ
Comment 22.1	That&#39;s not what this was about? They took her face and put it on another person&#39;s body. Did you even watch the video?
Comment23	Wow elites who want technology yet don&#39;t want us to use it against them
Comment 23.1	Why would you want to use it against them you cretin?
Comment24	The woman isn&#39;t remotely attractive, though... Why waste your technology on it
Comment25	Please, please do a David Boreanaz for me to play with
Comment26	"Tusk tricked the entire European Union on Twitter. Johnson did not write to him, and was not going to consult.<br />A criminal case has been instituted against Tusk in Poland.<br />Tusk must resign, Tusk turned a lie into a system of managing deceived people."

Comment30	the programmers used a video of her crying over her father?  people are gross.
Comment 30.1	P McFadden Yeah. Such depraved souls.
Comment31	Knowing is half the battle.
Comment32	It is amazing that any kid with a gaming PC can now make a deep fake video, yet BBC cannot edit a few real videos into a 4-minute documentary without turning it int a total disaster (including the sound track!).
Comment33	I&#39;ve been waiting on a new Randolph Scott western.¬† <br />¬†¬† A real epic...3 hour western.¬†¬† Scott as a Texas Ranger....with Gary Cooper as his pardner. <br /><br />Just a good&#39;ole western.<br />and ALL of the heyday Hollywood crew form the 50&#39;s and back.From back when...Entertainment was entertainment.¬† Not sex and blood lust.<br /><br /><br />Just one more good&#39;ole Randolph Scott western with¬† Gary Cooper as the costar.<br /><br /><br />oh well....<br />I guess we&#39;re stuck with sex vids.<br /><br />bummer.
Comment34	What the fuck is with the constant flickering. This is very stupid.
Comment35	"Trust me <a href=""http://you.re/"">you.re</a> nothing! I already cut and paste this comment but I want you to read what I have prepared for you during my reign. Who are you? I got attacked by a muslim next door neighbour in my house and he left me with a fractured skull and other horrific facial injuries! He&#39;s an ug;,ly jealous nobody pa;,ki bas;,tard. Months later after I discovered who I am ,the sun shone my path in overcast skies in leeds and all the white people watched and sneered because the Messiah ain&#39;t white euro! The government had heard of the signs proving I&#39;m the prophesied Mahdi! They let my attacker out of prison early! After he served around a year of nothing. They let him out of prison early after it was proven I&#39;m the Messiah and sectioned me under the mental health act 3 times. In h;,ell you&#39;ll bu;,rn forever l&#39; olam amen. But when I come to power you&#39;ll all be tracked and put to de;,ath! Yes your government officials and police. I am within my Messianic rights and I don&#39;t have to or want you around during my reignüò£. The scripture proves I&#39;m King of the world and I will absolutely have it done even if I have to wait for Jesus to get here. I will have it done no 2 ways about it! As for all who covered up I&#39;m Messiah! All who illegaly discussed my private life behind my back will get batt;,ered senseless at the very least and they will absolutely definitely forever bu;,rn in hell.üò´ You&#39;ve indulged in a lot of illegal activity against me! Coveting my kingdom."

Comment38	well is it just me or was Bella pouting out her lips to exploits mens sexual desires?
Comment 38.1	Get some help
Comment39	Sad but true. You want the fame and glory. You want to be in the public eye. You better be prepared these days of the trolls. I&#39;m famous for leading a quiet life and minding my own business.
Comment40	And it&#39;s back to non-news for the BBC news channel.<br /><br />You guys realise you&#39;re nowhere when you search for current news stories. All the american news networks appear, plus the tabloid channels but not BBC News unless you add &#39;BBC News&#39; to the search terms. And even then, it&#39;s BBC News uploaded by someone else.
Comment41	fear-mongering trash lul
Comment42	But what if every one in the video was deep fake ... <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />- M.Night.Shyammalan
Comment43	5-6 people will use deep fake to threaten and blackmail<br />The other 994 will dick around with it making stupid faces and occasionally edit a porno so the actor has their face on it
Comment44	Used watch her on Shake it up
Comment45	Maybe the girl is just double playing
Comment46	I&#39;m not condoning what&#39;s happening to this girl&#39;s likeness it is genuinely terrible but silver lining, if a sextape of her ever does get leaked nobody will believe it&#39;s actually her in it.
Comment 46.1	If that happens what makes you think people won&#39;t believe it? People still think her deepfakes are real....

Comment48	People being fake on the Internet has been going on since the net has started.
Comment49	Most pictures talking or in a video were I talk to myself is fake. but the one&#39;s that aren&#39;t aren&#39;t on internet long with out person computer crashing.<br />server grid serve considering it&#39;s on military server.<br /><br />Funny part is the unions and gangs like this technology and the development of new software is wanted billions before first CD  rolls off the copier.<br /><br />but the foundation for success is much more expensive first cd looking at  between billion in 400 hundred to cillion of dollars. if done  right then gillion dollars in 10 years but with 30 market unless subscribed get steady but falls out .
Comment50	Your government has been setting people up using similar technology, probably for 20 years.
Comment51	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ILIJ0APS-c&amp;t=1m20s"">1:20</a>  Are we all just gonna ignore the hair?  üòÑ"
Comment52	It will NEVER be stopped because there are far more legitimate uses for this tech than illegitimate ones. All you can do is make distribution illegal, and that&#39;s going to stop very few people.
Comment53	I hope it gets absolutely real.  That way the government will absolutely have to go back to using the post office for everything,  like they should.  The internet is cartoon land and that is where it should stay.  It&#39;s brought nothing but trouble.
Comment54	The BBC know all about making &#39;fake things look real&#39;.
Comment55	You can&#39;t stop evolution of technology..what we can do however is to change our perception of taboo associated with such videos...
Comment56	She is mad because she took nudes and they got leaked.... maybe dont take nudes ya dumbass

Comment 67.2	Thank you comrade.
Comment68	THIS IS WHAT YOU FREAKS CALL NEWS?? SICK SCUMBAGS
Comment69	I think this is also a reason why celebrities don‚Äôt really like going public to run errands or whatever.
Comment 69.1	Lol no it&#39;s not, this a relatively new thing, has nothing to do with celebrities running errands?? üòÇ

Comment 72.2	You pay taxes though, right?<br />Because the government has a Minister for Women and Equalities as part of the Home Office.
Comment73	This is what happens when <b>unregulated tech</b> üíª meets <b>rape culture</b> üö´.
Comment74	Damn deep fakes. How is a failing actress or singer going to sell her &quot;leaked&quot; nudes to someone for a king&#39;s ransom? This is putting decent sluts out of work!!
Comment75	Oh yeah, now is when you wont be able to believe what &quot;leaders&quot; say. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Comment 75.1	Exactly, if deep fakes remain legal than the playing field of truth remains level between government and populace, but if deep fakes become illegal than only governments will have this power for propoganda and they WILL use it.
Comment 75.2	Right??? ü§£ü§£ü§£
Comment76	If you see a video of me bumming a teen on BBC&#39;s TOTP. Deep Fake!
Comment77	Many of our problems AAaar(burp) own creation

Comment79	who?  ...she isn&#39;t even attractive.
Comment 79.1	@Jenima Rai Are you?
Comment 79.2	R u Blind..?
Comment80	Lol BBC. The primary source of fake news. Why do you even need AI? For the last 300 years Brits have been busy manipulating history to push their narrative, specifically on their enormous theft from India and for having wiped of millions of Indians, without the need of AI.<br /><br />A fake news source warning you about Fake news to sound Credible! <br /><br />Incredible!
Comment81	This is how BBC brain wash da lambs
Comment82	Sexual morality is a very important part of a healthy society!
Comment 82.1	And sexual immorality is a sign of decadence, which happens in most great empires, just before their collapse. The 7 stages of Empire seems accurate with American history, so far, which would indicate we&#39;re almost done.
Comment83	Wow that asian guys hair is tragic!

Comment86	Like all leftist entities, the BBC makes every decision from their groin
Comment 86.1	Peter Pain <br />Who said you were a leftist?  And your reply went straight to your groin...while you will never understand don‚Äôt worry, anyone with a clear mind does
Comment 86.2	@Ken Siefert What makes you think i am a leftist? By any means: amuse me ;)
Comment 86.3	Peter Pain <br />Thanks for proving my point

Comment90	Just ban porn ffs.
Comment91	1.- Why this video have those artifacts after being edited by so called professionals?...<br />2.- Why I going to be interested in the sexual life of Bella Thorne?... She sing in the act too?...<br />3.- A fake video of an UFO was taken in the 50¬¥s... I still not believe in aliens... but I&#39;m sure they exist...
Comment92	Lmao but he does look like Kim Jung un
Comment93	tech about yrs old! yawn!
Comment94	Big deal why is this news? Talk about the holographic disguises people can use live. That&#39;s way more interesting.
Comment95	Will deepfakes help me with my social life? probably not lol
Comment96	No intelligent adult even knows who the fuck you are Bella Thorne.
Comment97	Who?
Comment98	no one cares and in ten years they will care even less
Comment 98.1	No.
Comment 98.2	Oh, you will care if someone sents a video of you being deepfisted by the hairiest ugliest guy imaginable while coming all over yourself to all your coworkers / family etc ;)
Comment 98.3	You are stupid to think this is not a problem. There is so much misinformation out there . This is just going to make it worst.
Comment99	Tagline should read: &quot;Men will turn anything into porn&quot;
Comment100	and I should care because?
Comment 100.1	7 stages of empire
Comment101	Just like the advent of photoshopped images, eventually there will come a time when people become automatically skeptical of what they see even in video form. Creating a condition in which skepticism is the default setting for everything is not always an ideal obviously, because it&#39;s bad enough that people are already difficult to convince even when presented with facts. But I imagine that in a world where you&#39;re not sure what is real, that will be the go to defense mechanism of the general population. <br /><br />I don&#39;t necessarily think that the technology have to be regulated, but like every tool, the uses of it should be open to legal consequences. For instance, if somebody post a video that is labeled as real, when it&#39;s not, that should be punishable by law, especially if there are parties that suffer negative consequences. Even &quot;art&quot; videos where real life individuals are deepfaked to engage in acts that are embarrassing or degrading to the individual should be open to legal review or discussion. I&#39;m all for freedom, but it&#39;s one side of the coin, the other being responsibility/accountability. Can&#39;t have one without the other.<br />P.S. Why Bella Thorne? Seriously, I don&#39;t get it. What&#39;s so interesting about her when there are so many knockout gorgeous actresses?
Comment 101.1	Your right Jamie we already have laws that cover the potential abuses represented by deep fakes. If someones personal reputation or business is harmed by fraud or lies a civil trial based on defamation is open to the aggrieved.
Comment 101.2	Since she&#39;s outspoken - she becomes more of a target.
Comment102	BBC regurgitating old news. 2 articles and a video in less than 3 days about the same person and the same subject!! are you getting paid by them?
Comment103	Western countries =pornistan
Comment104	Is this is a preemptive strike? Who might have existing nude photos or films that this can be blamed for? Watch &amp; wait.
Comment 104.1	Welcome to the Internet, the biggest place to find nude photos or films of who or whatever you want or event don&#39;t want... Why wait?
Comment105	This is China&#39;s fault.
Comment 105.1	LOL. Ian Goodfellow is not Chinese. He is currently Apple&#39;s chief data scientist and the person who invented the AI that powers deepfakes.
Comment106	The sad truth is that we will never be ahead of the next thing. That‚Äôs the constant development of technology
Comment 106.1	Back to the pile, everyone!
Comment 106.2	Great point üëç
Comment107	If you see a video of me in a dress bumming a chap. deep fake. ok?
Comment 107.1	Hows about a Devil Woman?
Comment 107.2	That&#39;s oddly specific and a good cover lol
Comment108	If social media is your life or influences your life so much then you need to seek medical help. How stupid do you have to be to put your private family photos on face-shit, inste-grap and so on?
Comment109	Theres literally no beneficial good reason to have this tech. Class action lawsuit and have it banned across the internet. Create algorithms that spot the edit and remove or block the videos
Comment 109.1	@Archibald Maule Ramsay LOSER! Either you watch these types of vies or make them, either way youre a fuckin LOSER! Question... Do you think it should be your right to make fake videos that can ruin peoples lives? Or do you like jerking off to women you will never in a million yrs even get close to hookin up with like some creeper perv?
Comment 109.2	Keith Nieves you should be banned.
Comment 109.3	"<a href=""https://youtu.be/gXKbu-fg-Rc"">https://youtu.be/gXKbu-fg-Rc</a><br />Plz subscribe me I subscribed you"
Comment110	China the world&#39;s largest manufacturer of copycat phony products that&#39;s including fake verginity kit for women...it&#39;s time we should ban this M.fkrs from our countries
Comment111	The BBC is basically full of shit.
Comment 111.1	Thank you comrade - Mr Putin will be very pleased with your ignorance.
Comment112	Every new thing they come up with will be used for bad three times over.
Comment 112.1	"üëå <br />Plz subscribe me I subscribed you <br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/gXKbu-fg-Rc"">https://youtu.be/gXKbu-fg-Rc</a>"
Comment113	Lawsuits against the creaters and all the sites that allow it and the peoples whose bodies are being used should Sue too and everybody in general who was used should recieve pay for w.e Revenue the site made.
Comment114	So protect a persons Image rights and you protect them from any internet posted image anyone uses whether fake or not. If its claimed to be someone whether the person who&#39;s image is being faked has legal protection from its use.<br />Music is protected, Sports games are protected, Product trade marks and copyrights are protected, time for image rights to protected with enough safeguards that protect the individual from unscrupulous agencies.
Comment115	celebrity problems
Comment 115.1	@Max Hewitt they don&#39;t need to deepfake me, i&#39;ll provide the nudes if they want em, my body looks like a classical greek sculpture and should be celebrated
Comment 115.2	Jimmy Killem for now - soon it will be you!

Comment 116.1	i once played an old flash game: Wasted Youth. <br />this reminded me of that and now its so clear why there was never a part II
Comment 116.2	Is there a reasin the bbc is totally ignoring the ep stein case?? What about Prince An drew?? Royal pea do? Why isn&#39;t the bbc covering this?? Are you still covering up for pea dos like you did in the days of Jimmy sa vile?<br />BBC = pea do protection
Comment 116.3	Because it is.
Comment 116.4	Had the same thought üòÇ
Comment117	Hmmm never had this kind of problem before, maybe stay away from cameras next time.
Comment 117.1	@Lam Tr·∫ßn Have you even tried searching her name? She literally have half naked pics on her. Besides, if you work in the bank or in a hospital, or even a nursery teacher then this sort of problems rarely exist. My point is, if your holding a camera and your taking pictures of yourself, then you are to blame. What&#39;s worse is that you even posted it online. Take I for example, my family and family members and friends are the only ones that ever saw me, And that is good enough for me.
Comment 117.2	@Who&#39;s got the time? did you even watch the video? She doesn&#39;t need to be naked, they could deepfake her face into someone else&#39;s body and say it&#39;s her, and that&#39;s not only her problem. That could be yours. That could be anyone&#39;s. Imagine they have your nudes even if you never take those, imagine if they deepfake you into doing some crimes and blame it on you... no one is safe and we should be aware of this.
Comment 117.3	@Max Hewitt Images like taking a half naked selfie? That&#39;s not image being captured, that is her doing that to herself. If you really want advice, then I would advise her or whoever needs it to get a real profession job that helps the community or something and dont sell your dignity for money.
Comment 117.4	Who&#39;s got the time? You can‚Äôt live in a developed/developing nation without you image being captured, so what‚Äôs your advice?
Comment118	Whoa! Slow down, the fact that this technology is being used underground and soon easy for general public to access is scary. Like I don&#39;t care about a this tech but what about my children sons or daughter that I may have. There will have to live through this technology.god this make me sick. All the temporary satisfaction of people are going to destroy so many peoples life and this world may become the dystopian kind of si fi place just creeps me out.
Comment119	This is old news.
Comment120	Just raise children properly, instilling self worth. Or else you end up like this attention seeking ho, taking naked photos of yourself and putting them on the internet. Fake images won‚Äôt bother someone who is mentally stable üëå
Comment121	Here we go, BBC spinning it because real videos are about to reveal the extent of Pedowood and the pedo culture in the UK too after Epstein.<br /><br />And now there are technologies to detect Deep Fakes, so chill.
