Comment32	Stupid Indians in the comment section replying the jewels were stolen when Britain had conquered more than 50% of the world. The crown in the video is from the 11th century and does not hold the kohinoor inside of it. This was also gifted a long time ago.

Comment43	I adore the Queen and respect everything this courageous woman has endured during her life....I was raised in England and remember watching her coronation as a little girl there..she is an example of a strong woman the likes we don’t see today...today it’s all about hate speech and social media or going on television shows to whine and complain about opposition...these woman in politics have no idea what it means to lead a country through devastating times and not complain in public...this is a woman to look up to with respect.....
Comment44	Der Königin von England gestohlene Juwelen....
Comment45	Quran speech2019 taje birtania  continued utter surprise beautiful so like Ukrainian
Comment46	The Crown is a symbolic representation of power in the United Kingdom. &quot;A lesson in that all British citizens are servants to the crown which is being represented to the house&quot;. Sadly it is only symbolic and has no actual function or legislature in the everyday running&#39;s of United Kingdom. The Crown can be giveth and taken away at any time, showing that even the Crown itself isn&#39;t above the law.
Comment 46.1	No monarch or person is above the law. Even those people that live in a communist country where the dictator rules, is not above the law. <br />Monarch&#39;s, President&#39;s and Chancellor&#39;s are no different to that of Police and the judiciary system, all of which represent the law for us citizens to follow. Over the course of our history we&#39;ve seen what happens to our leader&#39;s that break the law, some were forced to abdicate and some went to trial and executed. Even in the US they have a process called Impeachment that gives Congress power to remove a sitting President from office. They have to be proven to have broken the law in the first place for any such action to be taken.
Comment 46.2	@Jerico Tan No she isn&#39;t, she&#39;s merely a representation of it. The Queen can have her titles and crown stripped away if many oppose to her way of doing things. Look at King Charles I or King Edward VIII for an example, both had the crown removed from them.
Comment 46.3	Uhh.. The Crown is the representation of the Reigning Monarch (In this case The Queen) and The Queen is above the law.
Comment47	"IF A DEMOCRACY CANT CHANGE ITS MIND, IT CEASES TO BE A DEMOCRACY !!<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/9q9LpRLsxzo"">https://youtu.be/9q9LpRLsxzo</a>"

Comment 92.2	sharon wesley So in other words, on this film, NOT pronounced correctly.
Comment 92.3	@Kosmos Horology l am English l know how its pronounced and how it came to be pronounced that way<br />and its unusual for Huw Edwards the commentator to make a slip up

Comment97	Fuck the queen
Comment98	What a farce for an illegitimate government !!! Pathetic and out of touch with the rest of the world.
Comment99	The jewels arrive at Westminster in that ornate coach amid great ceremony, but what&#39;s the bet they were removed from the Tower by an armoured security van or something.  In 2019 they don&#39;t carry them all the way across London in a coach for that purpose.
Comment 99.1	M J you&#39;d expect the Crowns to have very ornate cases but    they  are carried in very plain wooden boxes,  l couldn&#39;t believe it, the Keeper of the Crown Jewels could have caught the bus and no one would have took any notice
Comment100	Didn&#39;t she use to wear that crown during her speech? And when she wore it, would it also be brought separately, just being put on her head for the speech or would it arrive with her?
Comment 100.1	Bre Ra Yes of course she has worn it each time opening parliament only three times she has not that was when she opened parliament before being crowned then when Teresa May was prime minister and this time now The Queen is 93 I think it&#39;s too heavy for her it weighs over two pounds so this is why the crown was placed on a cushion on a table next to the throne and The Queen. The Crown always arrives in a carriage of its own with its own escort. The Queen arrives separately.
Comment101	What a shit show . Get with times people .

Comment 103.1	e sailesh No Kohinnor diamond is set the The Queen consorts crown it can never be worn by a man . Read up on your history.
Comment 103.2	@Alun Davies actually, I looked it up just now 😉 because it was mentioned in the comments so often. By the by I also found out that apparently the Kohinoor is bad luck only for men, and women may wear it safely. All these legends and fights for a densely pressed piece of coal🤷‍♀️
Comment 103.3	Bre Ra I wish I knew all that stuff and I know that some people think I’ll of it but they have not come up with anything better
Comment 103.4	No, it&#39;s not. The Kohinoor is not in the imperial state Crown.
Comment104	Stupid pointless gimmick.
Comment105	Well we know she’s iced out.
Comment106	Hope Prince Charles will became New King in England this year!!!👑🇬🇧
Comment 106.1	What a timeline if Prince Charles inherit the throne during the Brexit time?😅
Comment107	Mmm, i am asking, i dont understand, the title says queen&#39;s speech, but no speech at all just crown being delivered, and where does the crown being delivered ? What does this crown delivering mean ?
Comment 107.1	widayanto setio there was a Queen&#39;s speech,  its written by the government detailing the things they want to do

Comment114	when did &quot;being a loyal servant&quot; to someone become something to be proud of? I don&#39;t want to be a supplicant to some &quot;superior bloodline&quot;.

Comment 142.4	@M Scott And you really think those people and the king of portugal took most of their jewlery? From other countries.<br />By the time the imperial crown has been made portugual has already harvested tons of gold and precious stones from the americas.<br />There are ships that were so full of gold and stones that endup sinking because of their greed.<br />They only used part of the edward&#39;s crown to make the imperial crown.<br /><br />Not to mention the famous koh-i-noor stone.
Comment143	&#39;&#39; The Poor and The Needy are selfish and greedy on her terms.&#39;&#39;
Comment 143.1	@Mr Wiggins I assume that, that was sarcasm?
Comment 143.2	H Kay what the fuck are you talking about ?
Comment144	This is pathetic, the monarchy is a disgrace to &quot;Great Britain&quot; and they have failed 110% in protecting the Church (the people of God). They&#39;re all just a tourist attraction and the whole &quot;Royal&quot; family needs to be permanently exiled from the UK for what they have done, they aren&#39;t even English they&#39;re German. Paedophiles, traitors, Satan worshipers, criminals, murderers. The list is huge. There needs to be a French-like revelation (without the beheadings).

Comment 153.5	Wtf? She can&#39;t because abdication is frowned upon by the Royal Family. She and the Prince of Wales has given all their life for service to the UK.

Comment157	Look at all the stolen wealth - gold, diamonds from India. shameless people flaunting the robbery!! disgusting. UK will soon be 3rd world.
Comment 157.1	@Arun Kumar no need to,<br />I&#39;m pretty sure all of your rockets and space missions are useless to 99% of the Indian population. <br />It&#39;s funny When India has one of the lowest living standards in the world and they try to cure it by sending rockets into space.
Comment 157.2	Arun Kumar but you cannot make payments to the poor people in your country are<br />You mental do you think that in a country where men are drinking poison to escape the debt they are in that’s something that you should brag about you dunce

Comment159	Good for nothing queen
Comment160	That crown could feed a small country.
Comment 160.1	The small country should feed itself, just like Britain does. It&#39;s a small island
Comment 160.2	RR no it&#39;s not even in this crown it&#39;s in the Queen mother crown! P,us it was not stolen it was a gift to Queen Victoria
Comment 160.3	@RR well you know how the saying goes, Finders keepers
Comment 160.4	The diamond in the crown was stolen from India. It&#39;s called Kohinoor
Comment 160.5	That crown a artifact, relic, a item to be worn, a symbol of history, there millions of others things that could feed a small country.
Comment161	The pedophile Royal family have arrived
Comment162	Are you sure we can afford to put on this pointless show every time?  I can think of many other priorities?
Comment 162.1	@M Scott Even tho the majority of things might already be paid for pretty sure  organising the whole thing still costs a pretty penny all the extra security etc. But the biggest cost is to the city &amp; people   road closures the genereal disturbance especially on a Monday. And then there&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s plain Stupid!
Comment 162.2	It doesn&#39;t cost much.  The Crown is already paid for.  The soldiers and police are on annual salaries. The carriages and horses are already paid for. The monarchy is funded by the Crown Estate not the taxpayer.  Seems to me that the only waste of money is the House of Commons.
Comment163	Kohinoor diamond in crown is stolen from India......😒 Thieves

Comment166	Return it back to PK
Comment 166.1	If you want it really you’d nick it back
Comment 166.2	Nothing in that crown came from Pakistan or India.  The stones came from the old Crown Jewels.  The blessed days before whining Indians and Pakistanis.
Comment167	Without their foreign aid, we Indians could have never been the original owners of the Kohinoor diamond, which they looted from us.
Comment 167.1	@IceColdDrip you sore losers fought both the world wars with our you price of shit high on crackpot
Comment 167.2	A C your shit country lost
Comment168	wow I&#39;m early

Comment 169.2	@Arun Kumar That&#39;s true.
Comment 169.3	@Xx_Sonder _xX traditions are essential in all societies and are a result of people living together... Pretty much a basic thing in anthropology.<br /><br />Traditions connect people. Some more, some less, but they are orders of behavior which are accepted and respected by the majority whilst not requiring anyone to go out of their way to do stuff. <br />Christmas, Easter, st. jons bonfire, or even less public ones are there to make people look out for these times and passively perceive the passage of time on a larger scale.<br /><br />My it&#39;s technicality, even birthday&#39;s are just a tradition. (Where I am from we even have name days)
Comment 169.4	@AWResistance meanwhile Islam is already destroying uk

Comment 172.3	Colonial bling 😄
Comment 172.4	Rubbish.  The top sapphire was owned by Edward the Confessor who died in 1066.  The pearls were owned by Elizabeth I who died in 1603. The Stewart sapphire by James II and the big cabochon garnet by Henry V.  All predate our contact with your lot.
Comment173	OFF WITH HER HEAD 👍🏻👍🏻🤡😇🤡😇🤡
Comment 173.1	EXPOSING HATE CRIME you are uglier than me
Comment174	Our Xi will kick ur british asses stay out of Hong Kong
Comment175	Both Her Majesty and BoJo are essential now as they had the trust of the people, which might be the main arbiter, although the others need to be mobilized, too. As for the solution, is at the tip of your fingers and it will allow your renaissance.
Comment176	God Save the Queen

Comment177	"Chor, thieves looted kohinoor diamond.<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bringbackkohinoor"">#bringbackkohinoor</a>"
Comment 177.1	@Black Sun Even if it is not worn, was it not looted from India among many other things? Britain has museums displaying Indian artefact stolen from India during the dark British  Raj. If you people are so nice then why don&#39;t you simply return it.

Comment188	Due to wrong FAITH, Destructive level of human&#39;s emotions, actions/deeds will destroy human&#39;s world. Let&#39;s try to prove, how ? Everything/happenings in our surroundings affects our body through our various body parts, basically our eyes to create EMOTIONS inside our body. EMOTIONS create our demands through our desires. This is the basic functioning principle of our body. ISLAM teaches us balancing (safety level within maximum and minimum) and the devil (IBLEES SAITAN/one eyed DAZZAL/greedy jin and human those missions are only to success in this world, they never believe the life after DEATH) trying continuously to make our EMOTION imbalanced. Our intentions must be based on our HEREAFTER/AKHIRA/DEATH first. Then we can be happy in this world also (Inshallah). The devil basically using all types of social platform/media to imbalance our EMOTIONS through artificial intelligence(AI) technology now.
Comment189	UK&#39;s economy - $3 trillion.<br />İndia&#39;s economy - $17 trillion<br />Even though UKs wealth was looted from India but still now India is a superpower and 6 times richer country than UK
Comment 189.1	Divide that by 1.4 billion people though
Comment 189.2	No, India&#39;s GDP is 2.597 trillion, slightly smaller than the UK. Since you have independence you now have the opportunity to show the world what your wealth used to be ! Why is it still 2.597 trillion ? Surely you can do better...
Comment 189.3	India’s like ten times the size and we still colonised it and made it ours Hahahaha
Comment 189.4	Indians still salty.
Comment190	This crown belongs to India.<br />All of Britain&#39;s wealth is looted from India.<br />Give us our $45 trillion back, looters. <br />İf Britain hadn&#39;t looted India then Britain would&#39;ve been the poorest country in the world and India would&#39;ve been the richest.
Comment 190.1	@M Scott wow where did you read that it was made in 1838 you can actually browse on google when and where the kohinoor was stolen from
Comment 190.2	Yeah but your country is shit! Our small country managed to colonise almost the whole world hahaha. Go cry somewhere else
Comment 190.3	This crown was made in 1838, mostly using stones from the old Crown Jewels.  Ignorant git.  Why not join the 21st century and ask corrupt Indian politicians why they steal western aid money from the people of India? More relevant than whining constantly about the past.
Comment191	This crown belongs to India.<br />All of Britain&#39;s wealth is looted from India.<br />Give us our $45 trillion back, looters. <br />İf Britain hadn&#39;t looted India then Britain would&#39;ve been the poorest country in the world and India would&#39;ve been the richest.
Comment 191.1	@Climbatize you can get that if you can give back the 45 trillion dollars looted from India and the lives of 40+ million Indians back and make a United Indian subcontinent which your forefathers devided on a racial and religious basis to cause tensions forever
Comment 191.2	You can have it as long as you take all the &#39;minorities&#39; living in the UK. 👍
Comment192	I&#39;d probably accidentally drop the crown....
Comment 192.1	It was dropped in the reign of Queen Victoria.  It was described as &#39;looking like a pudding that sat down.&#39;
Comment 192.2	that&#39;s what i was thinking
Comment193	I wish I had it..........
Comment 193.1	I&#39;d burn it
Comment194	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz4NO2rBdr0&amp;t=2m24s"">2:24</a> Kohinoor diamond"
Comment 194.1	M Scott The Cullinan Diamond is set in this crown (imperial state crown). That is the second largest cut diamond in the world the largest diamond in the world is the first Cullinan which is set in the Queens Sceptre used at the coronation. This was found in Africa and was presented to King Edward V11 on his birthday.
Comment 194.2	@Black Sun He /she is probably too stupid to realise that.  There are no big diamonds in the Crown.
Comment 194.3	Vinod Kumar M No it&#39;s not set in this crown get your facts correct
Comment195	This crown belongs to India.<br />All of Britain&#39;s wealth is looted from India.<br />Give us our $45 trillion back, looters. <br />İf Britain hadn&#39;t looted India then Britain would&#39;ve been the poorest country in the world and India would&#39;ve been the richest.
Comment 195.1	😂😂😂 This is not true. If it is true, then it is also true that yesterday when I took a shit, my toilet turned into gold, and my droppings turned into diamonds.
Comment 195.2	@Ankit Kumar why so butthurt ?? <br />Your country was dominated by tiny UK at a time. <br />You guys were nothing but boot lickers of Brits.<br />And you still are, you still ride your high horses when you get a little bit praise from the west.
Comment196	That crown gets better treatment than most NHS patients 😂 just an observation
Comment 196.1	Bullshit I get very good treatment when I get damaged
Comment 196.2	@Iqbal Bhayangkara I think that is the point, an inanimate object receiving more care and attention than NHS patients.
Comment 196.3	So? You want NHS patients to be carried and locked in a tower?  They are inanimate objects not living things
Comment197	Good to see the leader of the gang&#39;s bling arriving!
