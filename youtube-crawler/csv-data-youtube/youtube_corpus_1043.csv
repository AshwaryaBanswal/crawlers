Comment5	No one cares because you&#39;re all losers from socialist countries that have fallen into chaos &amp; you evil idiots want to spread that same idiocy to the rest of the world &amp; mooch off of everyone else instead of getting your own shit together.<br />Smart latinos who&#39;ve fled leftist dictatorships vote against you because your useful idiocy is what led to leftist totalitarians taking over your countries in the first place.<br />So sit down &amp; shut up until you can actually contribute to the health &amp; wealth of the world instead of wallowing in your own filth &amp; demanding everyone else to take care of you.  Lift yourselves up.  You aren&#39;t victims, you are just willfully stupid &amp; lazy as all leftists are.

Comment11	I want to hear others opinions, because I dissagree in several points in this video. Starting with the word Latino.<br />Latino basically means Romance Languages. Any of the laguanges that come from Latin. The video mentions using the word Latino as a relation to language, not culture and somewhat about geografical reference, I believe then the concept here is wrong. Latino would be people that speak Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French. (Am I missing any other?)<br />Also, who decided to impose the idea that we need the word &quot;Latinx&quot;?
Comment 11.1	Oneplus Five you missing romanian.
Comment12	"Sorry but what I know is that you don&#39;t know that much about  the meaning of the term &quot;Latino-Latin&quot;. It doesn&#39;t have anything to do with geography. Latin America/Latin American yes it refers to geography but not &quot;Latino-Latin or Latina&quot;. Latino/Latin refers to the Latin Language spoken by the Romans, also refers to the languages derived from the Latin known as Romance languages: Italian, French, Romanian, Portuguese and Spanish and refers also to the Latin culture of the Romans. You the people of the Americas have nothing to do with this Latin heritage. It&#39;s the heritage of the Italians and of the Latin Europeans.<br />Latin American means one thing: refers to geographical location where people speak Latin Romance Languages or where people originate.<br />Latino-Latina-Latin  is about people who speak Latin derived languages and who have inherited the Latin Culture (Cultura Latina) of the Romans and whose religion is Christian Catholic and come from countries whose laws are based on Roman Laws. This is what it means being Latino-Latina-Latin and not the way you put it.<br />Latin America. The Latin European colonizers, French, Portuguese and Spaniards, named that part of the Americas &quot;Latin America&quot; (Amerique Latine) and the reason was  to make a distinction between the two Americas the one in the North, English-speaking and Protestant and their  Latin-speaking and Christian Catholic America. <br />So, Latino means one thing and Latin American means another and NO Latino is NOT an abbreviation for Latin American. A person coming or originating from Latin America is a &quot;Latin American&quot;  and Latino is not a Race and not an Ethnicity and not a Skin Color and not a DNA and not a Blood and NO there is NO Latin Music, there is NO Latin Food and there is NO Latin Dance. It&#39;s all an invention.<br /> The term Latino/Latina/Latin can only be used when in a conversation one has to state his linguistic and cultural background and not as the Hispanic Americans do by using the term Latino for almost anything that refers to them when it should be &quot;Latin American&quot;. Hispanics of the Americas must use their race or their mix of races to identify themselves like we all do and NOT  use the term Latino to identify themselves. These are the Races: White, Black, Asian and Red-Skin Indian. Hispanics although they speak Latin-derived languages are not culturally Latins. I want to add something else. Saying &quot;I&#39;m Latino or I&#39;m Latina&quot; is grammatically incorrect. When speaking or writing in English it&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m Latin&quot; whether masculine or feminine. Then when speaking or writing in Italian, Romanian, Portuguese and Spanish yes it&#39;s &quot;Latino/Latina&quot;. Please educate yourselves as there was nothing Latin on this continent before the Latin European colonizers arrived here and imposed it  upon you with their Latin-derived languages and Christian Catholicism. It&#39;s the heritage of the  Italians and all the Latin Europeans not yours<br />The Hispanics are: The Portuguese and the Spaniards. They come from HISPANIA wihich is the name given by the Romans to what is now Spain and Portugal.<br />The U.S. Census Bureau must change the classification of &quot;Latino&quot; as an &quot;Ethnicity&quot; for Hispanics. Latino is not an Ethnicity and nobody can change history. &quot;Latin American&quot; may be but not Latino.<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAFB7BZ7zjo"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAFB7BZ7zjo</a><br /><a href=""http://latino-news.press/"">http://latino-news.press</a>"
