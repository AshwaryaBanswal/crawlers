Comment12	So much better hearing about earthquakes not rantings
Comment13	Dutch according to the five.traits of being.a professional you are a professional
Comment14	Thank you so much for constant watch over California. Everyone in America is very concerned about the Big One that we are all expecting. I think you will see that happening between Oct_Nov_Dec......So KEEP WATCHING ALL MOVEMENTS...The main thing is to get the word out and keep warning them that they need to be prepared! What I would like to be said is they all need to get the hell out of there and some have left because I live in Texas near Galveston and there has been an influx of Californians moving to Austin and some people are complaining about it! The people that leave California have to go somewhere and Texas has plenty of room here! THanks for all yo9u do! I so appreciate you! YOU ARE THE BEST!
Comment15	Thanks Dutch !
Comment16	Glad Secret Service showed up.....it means you are well known with the right people since Trump is in position.....or Barry Sotero was still there....I would volunteer to hide you and the duchess from them all!!!
