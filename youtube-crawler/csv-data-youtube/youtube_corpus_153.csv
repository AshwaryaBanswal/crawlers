Comment8	Dear Jpn.<br />Go see this video: &quot;Playing the victim, historical revisionism and japan&quot; n his discussion of the events in nankin massacre with its population driven to desperation n the pacific war..<br />U will then knw why this typhoon hagibis will happen sooner or later..<br />Yr country inflicted some of the darkest periods n these ppl who survive even have nightmares n u living in yr cty hope yr ppl n country have no nightmares, safety n retribution not coming yr way..<br />Just let know everyday we are praying for justice to be served even if it will come years later.<br />To say those were war crimes was not a right description should say those were crimes of some beasts is more correct..

Comment16	Typhoon  Hagibis <br />played  havoc  in <br />Japan  with   huge <br />damage  through  rain <br />and  winds  in <br />Tokyo  as  well <br />on  12  and <br />around  in  October <br />2019.  Nearly  a <br />million  residents   were   asked <br />to  vacate  and <br />move  to  safer <br />locations  while  over  <br />five  dozens  are <br />said  to  have <br />died.    The <br />typhoon  Hagibis  is <br />said  to  be <br />worst  in  60 <br />years ,  following  a <br />storm  that  rattled <br />Japan  a  month <br />past  in  September <br />,  2019.  In <br />this  context  , <br />it  is  apt <br />to  refer  readers <br />to  this  Vedic <br />astrology  writer’s  predictive <br />alert  in  article <br />-  “  Fresh <br />look  and  innovation <br />at  strategies  becoming <br />focus  for  Japan <br />in  coming  year <br />2019  ,  a <br />Vedic  astrology  view”  <br />-  brought  to <br />public  domain  widely <br />last  year  2018 <br />in  October-November.  In <br />relation  to  September –October  2019  ,  the <br />text  of  the <br />alert  in  the <br />said  article  , <br />reads  like  this <br />:-<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />“  More <br />care  may  be <br />paid  during  these <br />months  while  dealing <br />with  or  storing <br />or  handling  fire <br />,  chemicals  , <br />explosive ,  nuclear-energy  , <br />hydro-power  and  the <br />like.  Some  health <br />hazards  or  health <br />concerns…………..  could  manifest <br />during  the  year <br />,  more  so  during  the <br />aforesaid  months.  One <br />or  more  of <br />such  regions  as <br />Kitakyushu ,  Yonago  , <br />Kyotco  ,  Yokohama   or <br />other  vulnerable  regions <br />in  Japan  may <br />keep  a  note <br />for  taking  more <br />care  and  appropriate <br />strategy.  ………..Hurricane  or <br />storm  could  also  <br />cause  worrisome  concerns <br /> in  one <br />or  more  regions <br />of  Japan  mentioned <br />in  this  article <br />before”.  It  seems <br />that  predictive  alerts <br />of  this  writer <br />may  have  been <br />found  to  be <br />meaningful.

Comment19	BEWARE of the Teachers of the Law.<br />They like to walk around with flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the market places and have the most important seats in the synagogue and the places of honor at banquets. They devour widows&#39;houses and for a show make lengthy prayers.<br />THESE MEN WILL BE PUNISHED MOST SEVERELY.<br /><br />COME OUT OF HER!!!<br />So you will not share with her sins and you will not receive any of her plagues, because her sins are piled up to Heaven and God has remembered her crimes.<br /><br />Warning Against Hypocrisy<br />on Matthew 23 NIV<br />God&#39;s Righteous Judgement<br />on Romans 2 NIV<br />The Good Shepherd and His Sheep<br />on John 10 NIV<br />(We can use google search)<br /><br />So when you pray DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES;<br />but GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door and pray to your Father who is UNSEEN, and then your Father who sees what is DONE IN SECRET will reward you.<br />GOD IS SPIRIT, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth;<br />THEY ARE THE KIND OF WORSHIPERS THE FATHER SEEKS.<br />&quot;Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway&quot;, we can use google search.<br />These are the teachings,<br />The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.<br /><br />May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with all.

Comment44	Sympathies to the Japanese nation. This maybe climate change but it certainly isn&#39;t man made climate change, that&#39;s the biggest fraud and hoax in our lifetime
Comment 44.1	@stop Mass Hysteria obvious. He is paid off from the oil companies. Trumpies deny climate change and women&#39;s rights on abortions. Carry guns that kill kids but deny gun control. Think Jesus is a blue eyed blonde and Obama a Muslim. They really are dumb. Most of trumps beliefs are based purely on political backing. He&#39;s a con artist and his supporters don&#39;t give a fig.
