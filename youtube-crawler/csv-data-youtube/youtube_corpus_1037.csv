Comment13	Ah, an American style election with American style living standards. Placards demanding without a hint of irony to invest in NHS and Schools? Tax Cuts? <br />The RICHEST 1,000 in Britain saw their WEALTH GO UP 183% DURING AUSTERITY from £256b to £724b. <br />Over a million people (many working) using food banks; 1 in 4 children living in poverty; homelessness at a 30-year high; real wages down; the worst housing crisis of any advanced industrialised economy; the NHS in crisis; the most ramshackle, anarchic and expensive rail system in Europe; the highest prison population in western Europe; crime up; suicides up (John Wight, CN).<br />People fall for this?
Comment14	You have definitely served your own people excluding English children!! My answer is fuck off
Comment15	Forget about anti-Semitism!! Best off going to the election therefore, you can deliver what you want, but hopefully the English children will not be voting, remember that you don&#39;t recognize them!!! Your own government recommendation, English children are not allowed to say that they are English on any official forms!!! Enjoy your election that is anti English!!
Comment16	All been noted that the UK government is amazingly in control of the country, I can not believe my ears and eyes, how Democratic Britain is!! Good speach!! Forget about the EU voter, and deliver the next Democratic vote for a leader
Comment17	Britain is looking really healthy, from outside of Britain
Comment18	AN ELECTION IS ABOUT THE ONLY VOTE THAT IS EXCEPTABLE FOR PARLIAMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT&#39;S BECAUSE IT IS PREDICTABLE
