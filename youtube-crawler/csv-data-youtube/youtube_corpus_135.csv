Comment1	&quot;President Trump is the best thing to have happened in America. He is a great strategician.Bold, upright, shrewd, courageous, and truthful. The Democrats just want him out.They do not realise this action would permanently tarnish the office of the presidency. X cept for the democrats everyone loves and admires President Donald J Trump. He is a great leader, I quote from Richard Nixon&#39;s book &quot; Leaders and Leadership&quot;. Quote.. Management is like prose leadership is like poetry. A great manager does the things right,but a great leader does the right thing. Unquote. Wake up America... <br /> The Oldman                            <br />Former  Pakistan Air Force.    <br /><br /> Former Headmaster Aitchison College LAHORE
Comment2	Please don&#39;t stand with this greedy guy. He will sacrifice any number of innocent soldiers&#39; lives for his selfish Jewish gang behind him. They don&#39;t care about people&#39;s lives. All they need is oil and money. They are abusing American people&#39;s lives in the name of defense. If he wants oil and money let Trump himself go and fight in battlefield. Whoever the political leader may be Democrats or Republicans. Go and fight in other countries&#39; battlefields and get whatever you need. Leave us people alone. It&#39;s time for us to stand together. Let&#39;s stand together as ONE..Let&#39;s stand together as PEOPLE and save our kids&#39; future &amp; their lives from these greedy political monsters.
Comment3	Turkish military operation is not against to Kurdish people it&#39;s against to kurdish terror groups called PKK/YPG, this operation protects all ethnic groups in Syria.There is about 4 million refuges in Turkey from Syria lots of them are Kurds and they are safe.When Saddam attack Kurds in Irak  more than 100 thousands find safe haven in Turkey.
Comment4	Turkey is the enemy of everyone. Where ever there is a Turk, there is Islamist violence, corruption, filth and hatred.

If you knew how much He loves you, and how much you are worth to Him, you would thank Him for His mercies, Psalm 136.

Comment33	If Trump made world peace and elimated world poverty it still wouldnt be enough for these mad lefties!
Comment34	"Syria: BBC leftwing hate propaganda intensifies - BBC <a href=""http://news.lol/"">News.lol</a>"
Comment35	"Pkk/Pyd/Ypg is definitely not freedom fighters. They&#39;re just terrorists. They&#39;ve been killing innocent people for decades. Babies, children, seniors and women. They slaughtered the teachers. They damaged the investments made for the development of the region. TThey damaged schools, factories, dams, mosques and churches (looted, arsoned, exploded). They attacked the villages. Turkey is struggling with terrorism for decades, this is nothing new. But terrorists, which have become official since the establishment of Isis, have now become a major threat on the border. Turkey obliging to do so.<br /><br />And accept that Pkk/Pyd/Ypg are not Kurdish fighters. Anatolia has been the scene of the brotherhood of nations for hundreds of years. These terrorist groups only aim to spread inter-communal chaos."
Comment36	I see, so.. the Taliban is all of the Afghans, the IRA is all of Ireland, ISIS is all of Islam .. therefore the PKK YPG terrorists must be all of the Kurds. Thanks for clearing that up BBC. Also has Assad stopped chemically  bombing his people .. we haven&#39;t seen images of dying children in a while. 🖖🏻
Comment37	Ok let me explane some thing turkish forces going there because us supported teroria group that is recognized by nato and USA. Russians are here because syria need help to not let USA to ruin their country but there is no reason to be there for USA.
Comment38	There are people criticizing every move of every president but the BBC is obsessed with pointing out every instance when it comes to Trump and ignoring it completely with the Obozo. Biased Brainwashing Corporation.
Comment39	Trump is a rat in WH . Who is on Putin&#39;s parole. If Congress does not Fire Trump out of WH. The GANGSTERS will win all the time.
Comment40	finally islam will be  fucked by communist party, where are muslim fan following of erdogan, <br />even saudis feel the heat, whole middle east is at the verge of collapse, sit back &amp; enjoy nicely<br />saudis say they will increase price of oil if they are attacked, the definately china will also join the race &amp; what matters is oil oil oil, only oil....fuck islamic morons nicely
Comment41	If you leave your ally, who would trust you!
Comment42	Trump stop spending tax payers money on supporting terrorists and take care of millions of homeless in USA .they need your help !
Comment43	BBC are misleading it’s audience

Comment45	And Trump says his Neo-Fascist friends are good guys. He got punked.
Comment46	Love to Syria🇸🇾 from India🇮🇳
Comment47	What will happen when Assad’s troops (backed by Russia) confront Turkish troops? This could escalate and quickly if Russian forces tangle with Turkish forces. Turkey is in NATO after all. However President Trump does have a point regarding US troops. IMO it is Erdogan who sought to seek advantage from POTUS decision to leave.
Comment48	turks playing the refugee card as a excuse if they care so much about refugees why did they just create 130,000 oh sorry they are mainly kurdish so its ok
Comment49	Today&#39;s BBC is the equivalent of the National Enquirer in the US or tabloid reporting.
Comment50	Turkey has no morale to criticize India. Turkey&#39;s move on Syria is more worrisome than India&#39;s move on Kashmir. <br /><br />Donald Trump and America are abandoning their allies who helped them in the War with the IS. Betrayal.
Comment51	Normal day in the middle east then.
Comment52	Great British people: Isn&#39;t it time to forget the past and stop killing the Kurds? If you have a goal that no Kurds remain on earth because of the criminal Saladin what he did in Jerusalem.....<br />please exclude the children because they have no fault.<br />Only exclude the children..🙏help only children if you can
Comment53	Just to  be clear, this was trump&#39;s decision <b>NOT</b> America&#39;s.
Comment 53.1	@Mean Old Lady the LEFTY SOCIALISTS have one agenda to DESTROY AMERICA 🇺🇸 as we know it !! LIE to thier voter&#39;s telling them vote Democratic and you won&#39;t have to WORK for the AMERICAN Dream!!

Comment57	American always betray his allie.<br />You can trust Kim jon ung as compared trumph .
Comment 57.1	@Mean Old Lady <br />War is essential if one wants to be superpower. If USA don&#39;t want to get involved then Russia or China Will
Comment 57.2	That&#39;s the problem with 4/8 year presidential changes...<br />Obama sank us into this mess while Trump wants to get us out while the mask of the leftists come off - showing their true nature as warmogners who are just in the region for their own financial interests.<br />They don&#39;t care about genocide or &quot;climate change&quot;, they only care about how much money they can milk from the useful idiots that supports them &amp; greedily gobble up their propaganda turds.
Comment58	only my left ear received the news
Comment 58.1	And that&#39;s EXACTLY how they want it.  Only the left matters to them.  ;)
Comment59	So this reporter will take 3.5 million refugees into his home?
Comment 59.1	Turkey is a trash. Free turkiye. Ťęŕ00řï§ţ Ęrdogun is running turkie.
Comment60	Trump is right, every us president over the past few decades has been involved in a new major foreign war of aggression. It&#39;s better the Americans pull out.
Comment61	That woman shooting hahahahaha
Comment62	NATO MUST PUT UP OR SHUT UP.<br />It always amazes me that the people who have the most to say about the withdrawal are the ones doing the least and more tellingly have no other solution themselves, other than to do more of the same which has not worked for more than 50 years.<br /><br />To paraphrase JF Kennedy the critics should &quot;Ask not what America/Trump should be doing for the world, but what they can do for the world by supporting America/Trump&quot;.<br /><br />It&#39;s grossly unfair of the world to put the burden of &quot;world cop&quot; onto America alone.<br /><br />And this nonsense of Trump &quot;leaving a void for ISIS to fill&quot; is utter crap. ISIS and Islam are not a geographic &quot;state&quot;.<br /><br />It is an ideology and a state of mind. You cannot destroy an ideology as if it is a geographic location.<br /><br />The critics must put up or shut up. It&#39;s American troops dying, not the families of the cowardly critics sitting in the comfort of their homes.<br /><br />Russia is Syria&#39;s ally and were supporting Assad long before America was there. It was also Russia who broke the back of ISIS in Syria, not America.<br /><br />America were late comers remember, because Obama was too weak to respond to his own &quot;line in the sand&quot;.<br /><br />Well guess what ... Trump responded to the &quot;line in the sand&quot; and did so emphatically. <br /><br />Let Russia mop up the mess.<br /><br />And by the way, the facts show that the MAJORITY of people support the withdrawal and not the fake news narrative stating the opposite.
Comment63	<b>The Trump anxieties in the comments, f-ing soy boys.</b> 😂
Comment64	Stop the wars.  Bring the troops home.
Comment65	BBC = bulshit brainwashing channel
Comment66	Team  A  (Turkey,  usa  , is••)<br />Team B  (  Russia ,Iran, Kurds )
Comment67	Trump 2020🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸. Turkey is an ally America has a mural defense agreement with. The Kurds have zero ties to the USA other than the last few years. Btw they didn’t just help us, we gave them all their weapons and vehicles. We stand by our ally Turkey
Comment68	Terrible audio quality
Comment69	Trump’s a complete COWARD withdrawing US Troops
Comment70	Capitilism and Globalism.. The world&#39;s biggest crime against humanity.
Comment 70.1	I think you’ll find that communism has that title.
Comment71	Trump saying &quot;Nothing to do with Us&quot;, yeah right. Since the invasion and fall of Iraq by the US, the Middle East has turned into a war zone. One big Zionist plan to rule the world with the USA doing the dirty work as usual. The end is very near, it&#39;s just a matter of time and more atrocities to take place.
Comment72	No reason for US troops to be there in the first place, other than protecting Israel&#39;s and globalists interests.
Comment 72.1	Andy N I agree, but don’t you at least think Trump should’ve given them some advanced notice? He just did it without that.
Comment73	Pelosi, Schumer, and Schiff have been doing everything they can to to lie, embellish, and exaggerate any move by the Executive branch since Trumps election. I’m pretty confident that if Trump and Congress did not waste 80% of there time trying to impeach or defend impeachment then they could probably work on the real issues. Ya know, like Trump has been trying to. Like the so called “manufactured” crisis at our southern border over immigration, the trade war, cost of healthcare and prescription drugs and the like. Seriously, just let the voters decide the next president in 2020. Imprison Pelosi, Schiff, and Schumer for sedition and treason, and then take CNN’s distorted Californian idealistic democratic sided zealot religion off the air. Yep, think that about sums it up
Comment74	Not causing war makes people criticize him? Fuck the bias bbc
Comment75	Have these people never heard about aiming?
Comment 75.1	The guys with the m16&#39;s did.
Comment 75.2	Crisis Actors don&#39;t need to aim.
Comment76	The Syrians never gives up in their land
Comment 76.1	united cameroon what land , the whole country is fkd up their is nothing left to save
Comment77	when a bunch of people start revolution against the country and start war for their own country is definitely a terrorists act
Comment78	Syria was always part of Turkey.
Comment 78.1	burcoman990  turkey doesn&#39;t want turkey if thats your point
Comment79	Right earphone audio not working
Comment80	The woman shots like child, she does not care where she hit
Comment81	Thank you Lord Emperor Trump, Agent of the Ruskies, Destroyer of American Soft Power, for his unmatched wisdom on pulling US troops out and letting Russia fill the vacuum. He will make Russia/China/Iran great again while attacking the NATO ally Turkey. I also must thank the uneducated voters for helping our great inside agent as well. If it weren&#39;t for your uneducated brains, this wouldn&#39;t have been possible. Thanks again :).
Comment82	Indian, Myanmar, European and Western countries that produce and fund terrorist groups (YPG, PKK, Hindu RSS, ISIS, Daesh, Taliban), then spread diseases like narrow ideology, prejudice, oppression.  The real culprit is the good people, who have become silent spectators against evil - we Muslims all stand side by side with our Turkish army.
Comment83	If Turkey think they need a safe zone,  they can create one on their side of the border. They don&#39;t need to invade another country to do it.
Comment 83.1	Tom C what do you mean ? I  assume the 4 million refugees who life in turkey ?
Comment 83.2	Turkey could just move the border if they wanted to. They don&#39;t want the shithole, they want to put the bums back where they belong. 🐐🖕
Comment84	America leave the middle east...American please stay in the middle east. Make up ur fuck&#39;n minds.
Comment85	Can we just not?
Comment86	Doland trump you have no shame  you are a bland,8 millions peoples are in under the lock down since 3 month in Kashmir you are a big enemies of Islam and Muslims.

Comment88	<b>Boredom Intensifies</b>
Comment89	In all honesty, I am glad that the U.S pulled out. Yes, what is happening to the civilians and innocents in Northern Syria is disgraceful. However, this is the first time in a very long time, where the U.S has in a way admitted how pointless its hegemony is. For the first time, the U.S has stopped interfering in a place where its has no business whatsoever, allowing other countries to become active in the region. Allowing Syria itself to take an active role in its own life. Effectively, the U.S is finally willing to take a step back and allow other countries in the world to become involved in the affairs of the world, rather than being the sole agent.
Comment 89.1	Of course, unless you didn&#39;t have words to comment on the deployment of American soldiers to &quot;defend&quot; Saudi Arabia against Iran. The same country where most of the terrorist from 911 came from.  Oh boy......
Comment90	America and what it once stood for, no longer exists.<br />Trump has not the intelligence to form any sort of coherent policy on anything.  <br />The guy is about as shallow as it gets like a toddler knocking everything over and expecting everyone else to clean up after him.
Comment91	What do you call a Kurd living in Turkey?
Comment 91.1	A Turd 💩
Comment92	Trump donkey
Comment93	Well his dentures were hurting, and his back is still in pain from bending over for the Israelis, and Saudi unrabbier . plus the new medication is not working. what do you expect,
Comment94	"Who let <a href=""http://erdog.an/"">erDog.an</a> out?<br />Trump dumb dumb.."
Comment95	"Marxist terrorist flag at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAIAjICTFAs&amp;t=3m20s"">3:20</a> on the coffin. Proof that the PKK are imbedded in the YPG"
Comment96	The only one that should have pulled out is Fred Trump, Donalds dad.
Comment97	Trump is right! Why do USA soldiers have to keep EU citizens in prison in Syria? It &#39;s a EU problem created by stupid left wing politicians! I&#39;m Dutch and Pro Trump! I&#39;m done with left wing brainwash propaganda.
Comment98	Tribal hand wringing intensifies.  Oy vey!
Comment 98.1	Oh kek man you must be overdosed on red pills rn smfh cucked out internet incel
Comment99	Trump leader of Nato USA Canada UK Australia Japan and allies
Comment100	Trump like to pull out except for Stormy&#39;s
Comment101	We are led by nancy boys with soft hands who grew up in extreme privilege, have never experienced hardship, and never served their country a day in their pampered lives. And a certain segment of the population somehow thought such people would make excellent leaders? Stupid gets what stupid deserves.
Comment 101.1	You are so dumb. Have you seen all the billionaires working for trump or you are so stupid and blind? Did trump serve a day in his life? No! He dodged the draft. Jesus! Go and grow a brain!
Comment102	We helped train them. Was the goal
Comment103	Now what happens? Russia is now guarding the border in places that Erdogan hasn&#39;t made it to yet, which is about 90% of the border. Are Erdogan&#39;s jets going to be shot down by Russian jets? Erdogan already said that no world power will stop him or change his mind. Then what happens if Russia invades Turkey? Turkey is a member of NATO. Are we gonna come to dictator Erdogan&#39;s defense? When Trump foolishly pulled our US troops out from the border, Erdogan didn&#39;t expect Russia to replace them, he thought he&#39;d be dealing with a bunch of kurds that have no jets, missiles or tanks. So now Erdogan has gotten himself in a pickle. Does he pull out and make himself look weak and defeated, or does he continue and possibly start a war with Russia? Right now Syria and Russia are just dealing with the invading Turkish force, but what happens if they start bombing inside of Turkey? What happens when Ankara or Instanbul comes under a Russian/Syrian missile attack? You know it&#39;s gonna eventually happen if dicktater Erdogan doesn&#39;t back off.
Comment 103.1	hillbilly beer dranker Russia bombs turkey and there you have it bro World war. U won’t have internet to comment nonsense.
Comment104	LOOK AT THOSE KURDISH WOMEN FIGHTING BRAVELY.   IT FIGURES THAT PRESIDENT BONESPURS WOULD DESERT THEM LIKE A COWARD...THEY HAVE MORE BALLS THAN HE HAS.
Comment 104.1	It would be good to see the virtue signalling privileged  feminists fighting like those Kurdish women.<br /><br />But they want quotas for the cosy office jobs.
Comment 104.2	They are fighting for their country like they supposed to do. There’s nothing for us in that Muslim hell hole.
Comment105	Clearly an invasion. Why does UNIONS continue to allow Russia advances?  Remember Trump well in advanced warned you of the planned pullout. What is Brexit now but a sliver to this beam? You door step, not ours. :( Stupid disagreement on nuclear pullout, costly, no? Don&#39;t be surprised if neither show were you think they are said to be.
Comment106	President Trump what did you do to the Kurds? Their innocent blood is on your hands
Comment 106.1	I&#39;m pretty sure it was the TURKS, not Trump
Comment107	I now truly believe Putin has dirt on the buffoon we’ve in the Oval Office.
Comment 107.1	you probably also believe in Unicorns or CNN news
Comment 107.2	@Aaron Stone Really? Bringing the troops home is what he campaigned on.<br />The only President who actually keeps his promises.
Comment 107.3	Stop blaming it on putin..just accept that POTUS himself is a lunatic clown..<br /><br />Btw russia has sent forces to help local kurds escape the active war zone.
Comment 107.4	People can be stupid😃
Comment 107.5	Now you blive it lol... Everything he does helps the Russians.
Comment108	God Bless President Trump for trying to get us the hell out of these meaningless , endless wars that no one really knows why or even who we are actually fighting.  Fuck the Globalist garbage !    Trump2020!!
Comment109	My left ear really enjoyed this video !!
Comment 109.1	I thought i was the only one lol
Comment110	Gog and Magog
Comment111	BBC IS FAKE NEWS.
Comment112	Americans were not in Syria to be the Kurds’ bodyguards. The Kurds have been fighting the Turks for centuries, and the modern Kurdish forces, who are mostly followers of heavy left-wing Stalinist ideology, were allies due to their convergence of interests. American troops were positioned in the Middle East because an Islamist sect had metastasized and formed a statelet, which turned expansionist, and a balancing coalition was needed. ISIS is still there, but not as a state and definitely not as an expansionist nation. While the Kurds were allies during the war against the Islamic State, they were also benefiting from generous American aid, weapons, and air cover, and they would like those to continue.  But the United States never gave any such “word.<br />Syria is a distraction. America’s biggest challenge is not in the Middle East, but from China, which deserves the most attention.
Comment 112.1	Sir, Putin was a member of the KGB, a Stalinist ideology follower. Right comrade?
Comment113	Oof left headphone PLEASE FIX THE AUDIO 🤪
Comment114	I don&#39;t really like Trump but in this case he is right   this is not America mandate
Comment 114.1	And you say this: after all the people these cretins have maimed and killed for ISIS. what exactly was the mandate? apart from helping and supporting the terrorists. ?
Comment115	When America was killing innocent civilian in Afghanistan, Iraq, yemen you silent bbc. Shame bbc
Comment116	This is not Republicans against Democrats. <br />A war on communist and children trafficking. <br />1. Australia  <br />2. Britain <br /> 3. Italy<br /> 4 Mexico <br />  5. Ukraine <br />Had the biggest baby, children trafficking  this countries colluded in the 2016 Election. All this country were helping Hillary to win the election. Campaign money.  <br />This is about child trafficking.  Not wars.<br /><br />Look how many <br /> children have been rescued from the evil communist Democrats.<br />If you knew what this demons do to children they would not be be able to walk in the street. Rape, sex, torture  this are babies, toddlers. Children under 12. <br /><br />For those who support the communist Democrats party.  Are as sick as this demons .. you condone  this behaviour.  You must other wise you would see them to what they really are.<br />Kill babies after they are born. <br />9 month pregnant woman can have an abortion. This were made into law. <br />Who ever support this and communist are in for a rude awakening.
Comment117	Says the British who set this shit up.
Comment118	Trump just gave Russia the entire Syria, wonder why is he so generous. I feel sorry for all the true men and women of America and their sacrifices to establish our present in this region.

Comment124	All leaders planning for peace but turning into violence....✋✋✋
Comment 124.1	All leaders planned and created a civil war for their own best interests. &quot;Capitilism and Globalism&quot;
Comment125	I support President Trump.  He made the right tough decision to pull our advisers out of Syria!  We had defeated the last of ISIS in march which completed our stated mission in Syria and had ZERO reason to remain there as uninvited guest for the next 100 years as apparently many Americans would have it, with claims we simply abandoned the Kurds. Trump got the call from Turkey (a NATO ally) they are going to attack the Kurds who they have been in civil war with for decades. Trump absolutely did the right thing and moved our advisers out of harms way and not play a game of bluff with American lives that could easily pull us into a civil war with Turkey and the Kurds. Our mission against ISIS was successful and the Kurds knew we were NOT there to fight THEIR civil WAR with Turkey. There was no abandonment whatsoever! Trump put economic sanctions on Turkey and international pressure against Turkey to help the Kurdish people as we can, without drawing us into their CIVIL WAR. Good strategy by our President and helps fulfill his campaign promise to get us out of endless wars. Trump 2020!
Comment 125.1	Where do I start? Maybe with the 5,000 troops deployed by Putin&#39;s boyfriend trump to help Saudi Arabia, the country where most of the terrorists from 911 came from? Oh boy!

Comment132	👍
Comment133	YPG DEAŞ PKK are same terorrist organization cteated by Evil Zionist and USA puppet politicians for Great evil İsreal to have more land.
Comment134	It will be a mess in the short and mid term, but in the long term it will in the world peace&#39;s best interest that America gets the fuck out of the Middle East for good and never return to screw things up.
Comment135	trump doesn&#39;t love anybody but himself
Comment 135.1	So you leftists should be hanging on his every word &amp; action, worshipping at the same altar that he does.<br />He is a lefty &amp; was loved by the left until he decided to run as a Republican (because the DNC is rigged).<br />Your entire party is a rigged shitshow &amp; you&#39;re still banging on about orange man bad.<br />Just do the country a favor &amp; jump into a wood chipper.  You can at least be useful to society (&amp; the environment!) as compost to feed the illegals you idiots allowed to swamp the country.<br />You&#39;ve already sacrificed your own children on the altar of political correctness, why don&#39;t you continue the cycle &amp; sacrifice yourselves to your new overlords as well?
Comment136	Pulling out US TROOPS from Syria is a big mistake
Comment 136.1	I think so too, but we never had any business in there except to cockblock Russia&#39;s &amp; the EU&#39;s interests in there.
Comment137	Fake BBC News.<br />Trump definitely made the correct call 👍
Comment138	Donald Trump has his tail between his legs and is running away. Just usual for him.
Comment 138.1	@ipissed  then allow me to answer your question instead, and at least give you a rational explanation instead of the generic &quot;orangemean bad&quot; answer for everything.<br />1- Trump haters would prefer war with Turkey regardless of the fact that Turkey is a NATO ally. Because &quot;Orangeman bad&quot;.<br />2- Trump haters recognize Kurdish militants (not to be mistaken with the official Peshmerga of the Kurdistan armed forces in northern Iraq), as allies regardless of the fact that they tried to blackmail Trump into assisting them in their own separate conflict with Turkey, or they&#39;ll release all ISIS prisoners - which they did. Again, all because &quot;Orangeman bad&quot;.<br />3- Trump haters see Turkey as the enemy regardless of the fact that Turkey took in 3-1/2 to 5 million refugees from devastated regions south of its border while managing to avoid a major influx of more refugees fleeing into western Europe.<br />Yup you guessed, all because &quot;Orangeman bad&quot;.
Comment 138.2	@ako tairi  I have asked at least 100 people this question and have gotten no response from anyone. Please, please, please Bill Hight tell us your take on this somehow. I am begging you. Please for the love of god tell us what you would have done?
Comment 138.3	@ipissed nah, he won&#39;t answer you. His the manifestation of his own bs comment. The sucker turned tail and ran after lobbing a keyboard warrior grenade.
Comment 138.4	Would you rather have a quasi war with Turkey in Syria? Why wont anyone with your same old Trump bashing comment answer this question? Just answer it! I want to hear just one of you morons say that you want war with Turkey. 🇺🇸☝️
Comment139	Syria is such a mess, because of it is a Proxy War. <br />Million of refuge in Turkey, but no one talk about the refuge problem in Turkey.  <br />If First World countries accept all refuge to their country , there will be no conflict. <br />Turkey will not invade to Syria because war is expensive.
Comment 139.1	Joni XD that doesnt mean that turkey has to take alll the refugees
Comment 139.2	Turkey is a first world country you Indian Stone Age man
Comment140	Sadly
Comment141	I love all Saudi people. <br /><br />I love all American people. <br /><br />I love all British people. <br /><br />I love Donald trump jhon my ankle. <br /><br />I love king Salman bin Abdul Aziz AL Saud my ankle. <br /><br />I love Saudi new crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz AL Saud my brother. <br /><br />I don&#39;t like Pakistan people. <br /><br />01 02 03 04 06 10 14 17 19 23 12 Thief.
Comment142	Syria need to obliterate turkey
Comment 142.1	ipissed he talks like syria is a strong country with people behind it, syria itself is almost obliterated
Comment 142.2	@ipissed well, Syria is backed by Russia if you are not paying attention.
Comment 142.3	LOL Turkey has 245 F-16 Fighting Falcons just for starters. You are an idiot. 😂✈️
Comment143	Trump saves American lives and is condemned by his own people. No gratitude. The children of the soldiers now out of harms way will know who is the man that they can be thankful for.
Comment 143.1	They are going to die for Saudi Arabia. You didn&#39;t know 5,000 troops are being deployed by trump to fight for the country where most of the terrorists from 911 came from? Oh boy!
Comment144	BBC fuck you and everything you stand for. BBC been lying about Syria since the conflict started in 2011. 😂 BBC is British government propaganda and misinformation.
Comment145	Trump gave northern syria to the Turks and Russians!
Comment 145.1	@Playster He pockets more than his salary in one game of golf at his own golf resort you dummy! He has spent in less than 3 years what Obama and Bush played in 16 years. Where do you think a portion of that money ends up? In his pockets!  Oh boy! The stupidity.
Comment 145.2	@Playster First, that crap about trickle down has already proved wrong a hundred times in recent history. Corporations that got tax benefits just invested in stock buy backs that again enriched the wealthy!  Second, Trump has never done anything to &quot;create great paying jobs&quot;.  Worker salaries in relationship to the wealth gaining of the  1% have been flat and even decreased for the past twenty years and not kept up with the cost of living.  Hence, most families are now forced to have two members support the family and often a single person must have more than a single job with less benefits!  Wake up cuz!
Comment 145.3	@Playster Maybe someone as slow as you may enjoy being a surf to a billionaire king who has used their elected office to unethically enrich themselves as they throw scraps to you from their table.  At the same time, these short sighted, baffoons are destroying the earth for their instant gratification.  Don&#39;t expect a seat on their billion dollar escape pods, dude!
Comment 145.4	@Energetic Guy Trump is the first President in history to not accept the presidential salary (which is a lot). Instead of taking tax payers money as salary,  he is creating jobs and PAYING tax on his hotel profits. Who cares about emolument. The reason why fake news media and Demorats are not talking about emolument is because  they know it is BS and NOBODY cares!
Comment 145.5	@Playster Violating the emoluments clause then. Oh boy! The stupidity of some Americans is laughable. Now they adore Putin.
Comment146	When did terrorists get hold of M16s? 🤔
Comment 146.1	@Gin Jones and turkey
Comment 146.2	Kurds aren&#39;t terrorists. They fight terrorists like the Turkish backed Islamic State.
Comment147	Demoralize, Destabilize, Create Crises than Normalize.
Comment 147.1	What the hell do you think islam is doing in non-muslim countries?<br />Islam has been at war with the entire world for 1400 years.<br />The rest of the world works this way too as the EU is in the ME shitstorm with the rest of us.<br />No one looks good in any of this, especially the jihadis.
Comment 147.2	A plain case of Yankee know how: &quot;Problem, reaction, and solution&quot;,  --- Create the &quot;problem&quot; by going into a country, uninvited:  steal what you can, kill as many as you can, force regime change on them,, which usually then leads to -- &quot;Reaction&quot;: the people become brazen and fight back, -- once this happens the yanks &quot;Solution&quot;: Run like hell.  worked in Vietnam, - bay of pigs - Suez - now in Afghanistan, and now in Syria, also Libya, and the list goes on
Comment148	Trump is cool... dragging America through the mud.
Comment149	Fucked up in his head.<br />The world is laughing at Trump and Boris gamble.<br />Some one give them some brain to think please.
Comment 149.1	@East Anglian I don&#39;t even need to look at conspiracy theories about how Trump is insane. I just have to make people read the letter sent to Turkey by him :D
Comment 149.2	@hobo dog What? Saudis are being heavily armed by Trump and you can&#39;t throw conspiracy theories as if they are facts. Trump is a freaking walking conspiracy theory. <br />And i don&#39;t need to fight for the Kurds. Romanians have done their fair share of work in YOUR WARS in Irak and Afghanistan as your allies. This is what real allies do, you should feel ashamed. Your own men on the ground are saying that they betrayed the Kurds and here you are defending a mafioso in the White House.<br />Have you even read the letter sent to Turkey? Only someone mentally ill would write that.
Comment 149.3	d Gtm is Americans are laughing at you. Defend yourself daddy America is sending you a fuckin bill from now on 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Comment 149.4	@East Anglian Why are Americans in congress blaming him??<br />So are you the one who knows more than congress?
Comment150	impeachment is too good for this fool
Comment151	Time for America to take care of America. 7 homeless died today in California alone.
Comment 151.1	Maybe the money spent by this liar president on golfing would help?
Comment152	Trump did not give a green light. President TRUMP removed the 50 military personnel that were in harm’s way. they will be dead by now or seriously injure. Trump needs a bigger army to contain the Turkish assault and is probably preparing right now.
Comment153	Excellent, both sides praying to the same god x-amount of times a day, both sides shouting Allah Akhbar. Can anybody connect the dots here?
Comment154	Trump created massacre of Kurdish friends in exchange for 2 Trump Towers in Istanbul.
Comment 154.1	Did public school exist where u grew up ? Lol
Comment 154.2	Stephanya your an idiot
Comment 154.3	I may spend the rest of my life commenting on this idiots post
Comment 154.4	No one could possibly be this Stupid
Comment155	The dictators in Syria are getting desperate finding ways to blame TRUMP in any way to protect themselves, unfortunately for them TRUMP said from the very beginning of his presidency American military will withdraw.
Comment 155.1	The west created the civil war in Syria. Micheal Fallon the ministry of defence was video&#39;d at a function with Assad in Syria, just before the war broke out. When he was questioned about it, he denied it. When they showed him the video, he changed his tone, made up BS. The government covered it up by sacking him for a different reason.
Comment156	That&#39;s there fight they want freedom fight for it
Comment157	I&#39;m so sick of other countries crying &quot;come fight our war for us&quot;.  FFS the USA tried fighting in Vietnam and lost pulled out and Vietnam is fine they figured it out so can Syria and the Kurds.
Comment 157.1	@Idle Mon I think your reading too much into all this.  You honestly think trumpet thinks strategically?  Of course there could be an advantage. But really it&#39;s about you ppl and your tax dollars going to an endless war that has been going on for centuries. It&#39;s about the countless American lives being lost over the years.  But of course in the thinking of a democrat you have to have control of everything. All the Americans have been doing for the longest time is stick there noses where it doesn&#39;t belong. In my eyes the American government is the biggest threat by going places they don&#39;t belong blowing up other countries and being a bully. Finally there is a sitting President that gets it and is saying enough is enough. There is a reason 9/11 happened and it bit because the American war machine is peaceful there a threat to the entire world.  Would it be bad if China and Russia put a stop to the USA terror threat? Not really I&#39;m sure that Canada and other countries would be fine.  I have a huge problem with all the guns south of the border and the whole idea that the US could easily invade Canada and forcefully take over. In my eyes Russa and China with whom we have good relations  aren&#39;t the threat.  It&#39;s the ones who have the idea that they have to control everything and park there asses and disrupt other countries.
Comment 157.2	@Idle Mon  Syria is a shit hole and has no strategic importance. The U.S. has Turkey and needs to keep it. The only thing the U.S. needs to have in Syria is tomahawk missiles. 🇺🇸☝️
Comment 157.3	Think again hippy, if you gain a strategic point on a map, it acts as leverage for everything. Do you want to live in a world where Russia or China has military present in places we are currently at?
Comment158	Kurds GIVE THEM HELL!
Comment159	I feel that Trump is right in pulling out our troops.  Why? Because the Islamic state has been fighting every country in the since  even before biblical time. Look how Europe has been treated by the Muslims. People are scared and rightfully so. Our Troops are needed here at home in the USA.
Comment 159.1	But sending them to Saudi Arabia, a country so rich they could buy entire armies with their money. Oh....they just bought 5,000 of our troops. It may be nice to have businesses in Saudi Arabia, isn&#39;t it? Let&#39;s ask Jared or Kushner about it.
Comment160	The Kurds, Americans and the coalition together helped defeat ISIS in the north and east of Syria.   It’s not the responsibility of the U.S. to act as a buffer between Turkey and the Kurds in a conflict that goes back decades.<br /><br />If Russia wants to insert itself in the north they are more than welcome.<br /><br />America first means “y’all work this shi^ out yourselves”.  🌞✌🏼
Comment 160.1	Let Russia insert themselves like they did in Afghanistan. Maybe this time they&#39;ll leave more military trash behind for the desert black market. :)
Comment161	God damn it keep the Wests nose of it let em kill each other , and while we&#39;re at it tell Israel to shove it&#39;s head up its own arse ..
Comment162	How can Russia be a peacemaker? What about the Crimea region?!
Comment 162.1	@John Smith nice try bot. Only fascism in Russia and not in free Ukraine.
Comment 162.2	@Tom Hill, price increases, life under sanctions, turning the peninsula into a military base, lack of webcams, oppression of Crimean Tatars .. Oh yes. The fake news don&#39;t tell this?
Comment 162.3	No one died in Crimea during the take over, can&#39;t say the same for the rest of Ukraine, where fascist government tried to ethnically cleanse the Russian minority for disobedience, but got the prolonged civil war instead.
Comment 162.4	What about it?? It&#39;s a part of Russia with nearly 90% ethnic Russians living there. Did Faux News not tell you them small details.m?
Comment163	Speak up can&#39;t hear you
Comment164	Fight your own f ing  battle  you panty waste  coward redcoat.
Comment165	We knew Trump was nuts. Now we know he&#39;s dangerous.
Comment 165.1	your the coward though f ing redcoat baby.
Comment166	The EU is BEGGING trump to act on their behalf.... WEAK!
Comment 166.1	@Mono Palle &quot;prove me wrong&quot; -- wtf, are you child? i can just say one word and you will be proven wrong: Obamacare<br />Now stop being ignorant of reality. <br />FYI you didn&#39;t just have common enemies with the Kurds, you fought together as allies. It&#39;s retarded to think otherwise, an excuse for those that will never have allies.
Comment 166.2	@Chiriac Puiu Trump has not broken a signed deal.... Prove me wrong. -Having common enemies does not constitute an agreement. I think you know this.
Comment 166.3	BS&gt; Trump just committed treason against his allies allies that were absolutely necessary to defeat US enemies. nothing more and nothing less.
Comment167	Where are the EU armies...?  OH, that&#39;s right.... YOU HAVE NO MEN!
Comment 167.1	@Mono Palle I bet they are still looking for those WMD&#39;s, right? USA bypassed the UN with a false flag operation. If you had any real balls you would clean your own messes and not to leave behind all these power vacuums.
Comment 167.2	@Backhand Oksanen Our leaders were standing IN LINE to throw men at Afghanistan and Iraq. Nobody refused. Can&#39;t blame others for YOUR mistakes.
Comment 167.3	@Andy NThat&#39;s why it&#39;s all so funny, ALL they can do is cry out for TRUMP to do something... ALL the EU nations are doing NOTHING, while demanding the US do SOMETHING....
Comment 167.4	Best the UK and Europe stay out of it. The west have caused enough terrorism and immigration crisis, without pouring more fuel on it.
Comment 167.5	How is this our war? We have been mopping up disasters of Americans for decades. Just look at Afghanistan, Iraq...
Comment168	Praying for Israel 🙏🙏🙏 and all that middle East I crying 💔😢💔 so sorry
Comment169	Trump is lies I so sorry for trump is left you are hero&#39;s thank you to the Kurds I&#39;m very very sorry I wish I could do something to keep our troops there with you but obviously our presidents an idiot chicken bad judgments and bad may God be with you
Comment170	I get used to watch these videos now. I feel like they just making a movies. Imagine if these things were not made up fake movies. Then this news reporter would not be in war zone like this!! Im fuckin tired of watching these fake movies!!! If this was real Who fck would risk his/ her life to record whole this fake shits?! Ask urself!
Comment171	These pathetic subspecies have been fighting for 5000 years it won&#39;t be finished till every one of them is dead
Comment 171.1	@Mean Old Lady that&#39;s not true no other animal kills for land or power or sport they only kill for necessity.
Comment 171.2	Not just us, but every other life form as well - competing for the same resources as the rest of their species &amp; other critters too.<br />The rich want all the resources for themselves at everyone else&#39;s expense &amp; anyone that foolishly believes in their &quot;altruistic&quot; lies is foolish.  Beware appeals to emotion &amp; incitement to mob violence.  Once you engage in that, you are a pawn of your masters for their agendas.  Anger robs people of sense &amp; reason.
Comment 171.3	@Tom Hill out of my entire comment that&#39;s what you pick out
Comment 171.4	@Tom Hill Read history. These people are fighting even before Abraham, father of judaism. (At least 5000 years is correct)
Comment 171.5	5000 years??? <br />Try 100 years and you might be closer to the mark.
Comment172	The invasion of Iraq will go down in history as one of the biggest blunders of the 21st century. War creates poverty, poverty creates migration, migration creates resentment, resentment creates right wing populism.
Comment 172.1	And fight wing populism creats fascism
Comment 172.2	So no problems in syria then !
Comment 172.3	@brennan clarahan You don&#39;t have a clue.  SMH
Comment 172.4	@nikos kokomplokos <br />The Americans were pushed out of Vietnam by a bunch of Flip Flop wearing people .<br />The USA messed up Afghanistan and started supplying arms to the Afghans to fight the Russians ,this was not enough. Then started making Muslim extremists (Al Qaeda ) to be more effective against the Russians .<br />America did not consider the consequences of creating such monsters .<br />Countries  ended up in wars because of direct or indirect American<br />intervention and were led into a Mess and can not be sorted out.
Comment 172.5	Vietnam was the first great farce. It set the stage for the &quot;cooking up some bs and then invading&quot; strategy, in a very modern way. They got away with it then. They got away with Iraq. They will continue to get away with it.
Comment173	America or NATO can attack another country on the suspicions but turkey is not allowed to guard its border even after knowing the situation in Syria. Double standards!
Comment 173.1	hillbilly beer dranker talking about sense while threatening and sanctioning turkey?  😂 by doing this they are pushing Turkey towards Russia and China not the other way around
Comment 173.2	I M - America is trying to talk some sense into Erdogan and stop this war. We don&#39;t want Russia invading Turkey. Russia is an ally with Assad.
Comment174	Send NATO troops in there
Comment 174.1	That&#39;s what NATO member Turkey is doing...
Comment 174.2	NOPE
Comment175	I don&#39;t know why, but I get the sense almost everything Trump has done in the last 2 1/2 years has been a great help to Putin! Am I mistaken?
Comment 175.1	@John Smith  Sanctions? Obama put the sanctions. Trump wanted them down. And still fighting in Ukraine with his crappy Biden&#39;s conspiracy to make both Russia and Ukraine friends, sanctions are off. Putin wins, more hotels somewhere.
Comment 175.2	@Wiels Luk Well if your referring to their long period of losing in Afghanistan, you might be right. But, if the Mid-east decides that America can&#39;t be trusted to stick the course in their defense, Russia is always looking for more oil just like we are! So They may become the Mid-easts new best friend.
Comment 175.3	@Mono Palle It is Trumps &quot;job&quot; to act in the interest of his country, as the Leader of America, not to act as an agent for Putin. And I think you have a telling attitude.
Comment 175.4	@John Smith Everytning you say in the first part of your comment are true. It&#39;s just that I and other Americans think Trump did them for Russia. You find it ironic that Trumps acts &quot;end up helping Russia&quot;. I find in those very same acts complicity on the part of Trump helping his good friend Putin It is also obvious to a number of Americans that everything Trump has done and is still doing is meant to destroy America&#39;s International position and to weaken our International trade deals. So far Trumps batting average in Baseball parlance is, 000.00.
Comment 175.5	No you are exactly right
Comment176	"Agree with Mayor Pete Buttigieg. He is our hope to unite Americans in 2020. 🇺🇸<br />Mayor Pete is the intellectual, spiritual, war veteran who has respect for others.<br />He is a great leader &amp; will be an amazing President to Make America Respectful Internationally Again <br />Mayor Pete can unite all Americans (Republican, Democrats , Anti Trump) who respect each other.🇺🇸 Impeachment coming for trump <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ImpeachTrump"">#ImpeachTrump</a>"
Comment 176.1	Won&#39;t change the fact I&#39;m voting for PETE NOT PUTIN!!!
Comment 176.2	It&#39;s not down to the voters. The establishment already know who&#39;s going to be the next president.
Comment 176.3	He&#39;s refreshingly calm and articulate answering directly!!  Keep on keeping on Mr. Pete !!!
Comment177	The little mushroom dk pussygrabber DRUMPF is a global security threat
Comment 177.1	@OC225 ONLY racists traitors criminal morons and sexual predators support this idiot putin puppet DRUMPF 😀 maga fools
Comment 177.2	👆
Comment 177.3	No, indoctrinated useful idiots like yourself are because you blindly gobble up every leftist propaganda turd you find &amp; don&#39;t bother to think critically for yourself.<br />You just want the appearance of security &amp; wealth without having to lift a finger.  You are a useless consumer &amp; a mindless drone of a voter which your &quot;dear leaders&quot; are counting on to keep them voted into power while like vampires, they drain away our wealth through increasingly draconian laws &amp; taxes until everyone is enslaved.
Comment178	*Current News about Trump&#39;s latest Decision: The U.S. Troops will remain in Northern Syria! Or Trump has CANCELED the Previous DECISION!
Comment179	Y 2029

Comment182	Go hang him. Hes insanely Wrong.👈👀
Comment183	bring our troops HOME
Comment 183.1	So you think Trump shouldn&#39;t have sent troops to Saudi Arabia?
Comment184	Well the Kurds are communists. It’s for the best.
Comment185	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAIAjICTFAs&amp;t=2m56s"">2:56</a> what about Libya  Grenada Vietnam  and many others they didn&#39;t  concern  you demons  either"
Comment 185.1	@ME Simo well technically speaking 0llllll ain&#39;t wrong either.
Comment 185.2	@0IIIIII Yup!!! Exactly like the Iraqi people welcomed George Bush and Tony Blair in order to get rid of the mass destruction weapons :)
Comment 185.3	ME Simo it doesn’t change the fact that the US and other nations like ROK and Australia were welcomed by the South Vietnamese.
Comment 185.4	They cannot stand the heat, when people shoot back. even the clown custer was flogged with bows and arrows.
Comment 185.5	@0IIIIII See!! Again you&#39;re just repeating what you hear from imperialist minds like Tucker and others :)<br />We became involved in Vietnam because we feared the spread of communism to Vietnam and to the rest of Asia. We decided to send money, supplies and military advisers to the corrupt South Vietnamese Government.<br />US was unable to defeat the Vietcong and was met with growing opposition to the war back home as you may have heard in news channels other than Fox lol
Comment186	shouldn&#39;t really care who respects what.  bit sissy.  maybe he could save the little whinging for some one else this time.
Comment187	we should send in the paras and let the boys sort it out in a month.
Comment 187.1	We should stay out of it and stop creating immigration crisis and terrorism.
Comment 187.2	need lots of body bags.
Comment188	Ceasefire through sanctions pressure. What could be more self evident.
Comment189	there must be a portable bullet proof glass behind such daring reporters to keep them safe
Comment190	&quot;We are at war with Eurasia, we have always been at war with Eurasia&quot;.
Comment191	Dear BBC, let all the UK soldiers grab rifles and fight your war in Syria.  Then you can report to their mothers how their children died for some other country.  BBC making Great Britain  great again.
Comment 191.1	Exactly.
Comment192	Is this only playing out of the left channel for anyone else?
Comment193	I wonder if they aimed correctly instead of hip firing AKs down a ally way then all of these wars in the Middle East would be over in a couple of years 😂
Comment 193.1	Crisis Actors don&#39;t need to aim.
Comment 193.2	They think its counter strike
Comment 193.3	they got a hip-fire sway reduction badge equipped
Comment194	please why dont you go yourself .. why choose kurda over american lives?
Comment195	the arms deal with Saudi Arabia,  what&#39;s Trumps plan?
Comment 195.1	The support pushback against increasingly aggressive Iran.  Iran&#39;s the only power that threatens the rest of the ME right now.<br />Yes, SA is behind wahabbist propaganda, financing terrorists (and so are morons who donate to islamic &quot;charities&quot; despite overwhelming evidence that they are fronts for supporting jihad) &amp; they finance most mosques being built in the west.<br />Both are the enemy because their cult, islam is the enemy of the world.<br />In islam, there are only 2 factions: Dar al islam &amp; dar al harb - the world of islam &amp; the world of war.<br />Everything is about conquest, by any means necessary, with islam &amp; the west will lose because of moronic leftists who have the historical attention span of a flea.
Comment 195.2	Nukes. like they did with Israel.
Comment 195.3	bigly
Comment196	Betrayal!! Stupid Trump!!
Comment 196.1	Your country should declare war on Turkey.  No more Turkish holidays for you, Ace!
Comment197	Ankara’nin sembolu anitkabir’dir amin ogullari niye cami’nin onunden roportaj veriyon
Comment198	These people can not get along and never will!!!!!! President Trump decided we will not spend American lives. Now everyone acts like it the U.S. fault. I suggest anyone that doesn&#39;t like it should buy a gun and go.
Comment 198.1	@Chris P. Bacon Are you dense? 5,000 troops are deployed to S Arabia. You were saying we will not spend American lives. But it&#39;s OK if we do for S Arabia, where most of the 911 terrorists came from. Were you a mercenary like the 5,000 troops going to S Arabia? Duh!
Comment 198.2	@Energetic Guy Already served. If your so energetic you go
Comment 198.3	Maybe you ought to join the 5,000 troops going to fight for Saudi Arabia? Oh, you didn&#39;t know that or it doesn&#39;t fit your agenda?
Comment 198.4	don&#39;t try to put a positive spin on this. there is nothing positive about it. turkey would have never invaded if they didn&#39;t know that the US would pull out. a deal was clearly struck to betray the kurds for god knows what reason. say goodbye to your only real allies against ISIS in the region.
Comment199	Plus the US has sent around 5 thousand troops to Saudi Arabia to help fight Yemen . The troops are not coming home like the citizens of the US wanted but the US government is just moving them around in the Middle East and that&#39;s why US has over 25 soldiers committing suicide every day.   The US president needs to do the will of the people and bring ALL our troops home!
Comment 199.1	@GodBless America Are you blind or you didn&#39;t read the comment above? We are sending 5,000 troops to fight a war that is not our war in Saudi Arabia. Jesus! Grow a brain!
Comment 199.2	@GodBless America because of Americas greed ..they will always be in other ppls business...
Comment 199.3	Why is BBC Downing POTUS for pulling our troops BACK HOME?<br />The mid east has fought for thousands of years. Americans have paid billions in a war not ours. Enough of U.S. fighting others wars for them.
Comment 199.4	It’s amazing how America is allies with the two countries in the region with the worst human rights records. Yet we’re told we’re trying to bring peace.
Comment200	Why does a Trump Tank have rear-view mirrors?: so they can see the battle.
Comment 200.1	Brennan, oh I thought you understood English. The Indian genocide is somewhere around 35 Million, a conservative account. I have read that the real numbers are close to 65 Million... which is like the entire population of UK combined. And these Famines unlike the Potato famine caused by Blight was British created who incessantly raised taxes on Indians and stole the grain when there were no rains. Lord Lytton set up help camps 100s of miles away telling the world that the benovalent British empire has created help for Indians. In reality they were set up 100s of miles away so that most starving ppl would die enroute. More would die in the camps due to hard labor. Do you know the difference?
Comment 200.2	Jan Sprat oh I thought you meant the potato famine, which killed more white people than Indians got killed when British left. No countries helped the Irish like they help the Syrians
Comment 200.3	A T Trump could have given the Kurds a heads up so they could have at least evacuated the civilians. Trump played right into Erdogan and Putin’s hands. Erdogan is now slaughtering the Kurds who faught ISIS for us and Putin’s State media is pounding the message “you can’t trust the US as an ally but Russia will be there for you”.
Comment 200.4	Jon 66 you’re an idiot. Turkey is our ally since 1945, they also have a better conventional military than even Russia. It is a genius move to have our Muslim ally control the Muslims.
Comment201	Syria was stable with only a couple of hundred US troops and their government needed to imply a military force and a police force while we helped keep the peace. We the United States have to call it quits at some time somebody is always going to need help we can&#39;t be there continuously we have a country to run and people to feed. Plus! we have an invasion at our Southern borders also a hundred thousand people a month rushing our borders!! Syria is not our problem anymore besides it was never our problem we offered our help and the world took advantage of the US dollar.
Comment 201.1	You are just too dumb to believe trump and his &quot;border emergency&quot; crap.  Haven&#39;t you seen the deployment of 5,000 soldiers to go to the country where most of the terrorists from 911 came from? Has Mexico send that money for the wall? Oh boy!
Comment 201.2	Jim Dooley   So why does the US have more than  800 overseas bases and have just announced a new one in Greece? Why not “call it quits” in at least half of the overseas bases?
Comment 201.3	Ahh yes the US has done a grand job destabilising countries by sponsoring terrorists. Syria was a secular country and is now rubble thanks to America and the Zionist interests that control its foreign policy.
Comment202	How many gears are there on a Trump tank?: one forward and four reverse!
Comment 202.1	You should go to Syria and find out.  Don&#39;t get blown up or lose your head.
Comment203	Why another wars in 2019 😢 <br />People’s dying , children’s is suffering and starvation 😢 So sad 😞 humans still haven’t learned anything about WW1 WW2 😢 how many people more have to die !! How many families have to destroyed !!! How many innocent children’s have suffered from stupidity of selfish adults 🤬
Comment204	The people who put Trump in office, seems like Trump is returning the favour...
Comment 204.1	@Kryptic Scope <br />1- The Arab spring uprising of 2011 usherd forth Syrian rebels who attack Assad. The Kurds seized the opportunity to push for a Kurdish ethno-state by informally seceding from Assad as the fighting broke out.<br />2- in 2012 Obama sends the CIA <b>to train and equip Syrian rebels</b> who then form a motley alliance with Jihadi terrorists Qaeda and Jahbat al Nusra, in a combined offensive against Assad.<br />-In Feb 2014 this precarious alliance not surprisingly disintegrates due to infighting forming the reemergence of ISIS who suddenly attack the Kurds. By the summer of that year ISIS creates a mini caliphate encompassing advancing territory in northeastern Syria.<br />- The US is forced into damage control, effectively changing the primary objective of all anti Syrian forces, by making ISIS their number 1 target.<br />This immediately threw the US into damage control by cleaning house and not wanting past skeletons in the closet (ISIS), to come back and skewer the official narrative of being there in the first place, especially after the power vaccum they left behind in Iraq that created ISIS in the first place. That had as much to do with it alongside helping the Kurds, who up until then were quite ok with waiting for the dust to settle before finally declaring a separate state as bounty in the spoils of war.
Comment 204.2	@buddy camp and China&#39;s military budget was just 150 billion dollars in 2015, they&#39;re clearly trying to take over America as a global super power and being a country with 1 billion+ people, they&#39;ll probably seek to expand it&#39;s borders to make more room for an already over crowded country...
Comment 204.3	The Department of Defense says China&#39;s military budget is around ~200 billion+
Comment 204.4	@buddy camp ummm??? Yes they are refereeing the entire world... The United States army has over 500 bases around the globe... and what for? To deter countries like china from taking over another country... Espicially now that china has a military budget of 250 billion dollars inching it closer to the United States...
Comment205	What if the Turks inadvertently hit a Russian convoy?
Comment 205.1	@0IIIIII my point is the turks respect the russians more that the americans. Russia is selling turkey the S400, building a gas pipeline to turkey as well as other economic projects. Russia is building closer relations with turkey than US is even though they are part if NATO.
Comment 205.2	kentucky fried ok so what’s your point?
Comment 205.3	"@0IIIIII <a href=""https://southfront.org/u-s-soldier-died-in-syria-kurdish-sources-claim-he-was-killed-by-turkish-military/"">https://southfront.org/u-s-soldier-died-in-syria-kurdish-sources-claim-he-was-killed-by-turkish-military/</a> <a href=""https://youtu.be/IBsO565fqAo"">https://youtu.be/IBsO565fqAo</a>"
Comment 205.4	kentucky fried evidence?
Comment 205.5	@0IIIIII the turks hit a US convoy killing a US soldier. They wont hit a russian convoy though. Keep dreaming.
Comment206	Poor bbc lying to the people. You and your government make a war in Syria not turkey or Assad. Bbc take a good shoot to manipulate the people. Communist propaganda socialism organization.
Comment207	Trump can never win, they accuse him of being a war mongerer, so he&#39;s like &quot;Ok i&#39;ll pull the troops out of there and not get involved in someone elses war&quot;, and now they criticise him for doing the opposite of what they first accuse him. This is why if he legit does something terrible one day, most won&#39;t believe it because liberals cry wolf so much. I hope you&#39;re happy.
Comment 207.1	@Joe T <b>trolling</b> again, typical right wing snowflakes who won&#39;t acknowledge hypocrisy, and instead change the subject
Comment 207.2	@Dougem Medhen where have i changed the subject. And snowflake? it&#39;s literally been left wing liberals who police everyone&#39;s opinions, invented safe spaces and added &#39;phobia&#39; to loads of words simply because they can&#39;t stand to hear someone else&#39;s views. I&#39;m not any wing, there was a time when my perspective was considered neutral, it&#39;s just that the left have become so uncompromising and extreme that anyone not like them is considered right wing.
Comment 207.3	@T S as soon as you tell ~me~ how you know what was said in that phone call.
Comment 207.4	@Nonya Bizness Please enlighten us in your all great and unmatched wisdom what you would have done as president if you received a call from Erdogan stating that his NATO member Turkey was definitely going to invade Syria within the next 3 days? 🤨
Comment208	All these &quot;leaders&quot; have no regard for human life.
Comment 208.1	@Joseph Stalin The world is praying for us to be the global power, think about it. Russia or China cannot be trusted, as i&#39;m assuming your english due to you speaking english and your grammer. Now is not the time.
Comment 208.2	Please don&#39;t stand with this greedy guy. He will sacrifice any number of innocent soldiers&#39; lives for his selfish Jewish gang behind him. They don&#39;t care about people&#39;s lives. All they need is oil and money. They are abusing American people&#39;s lives in the name of defense. If he wants oil and money let Trump himself go and fight in battlefield. Whoever the political leader may be Democrats or Republicans. Go and fight in other countries&#39; battlefields and get whatever you need. Leave us people alone. It&#39;s time for us to stand together. Let&#39;s stand together as ONE..Let&#39;s stand together as PEOPLE and save our kids&#39; future &amp; their lives from these greedy political monsters.
Comment 208.3	@Joseph Stalin Not a withdrawl just a reshuffle.
Comment 208.4	@Joseph Stalin lmao no uzsa want to take over syria for israel hence why rabbi trump gave israel the golan heights its not rabbi trumps to give.
Comment 208.5	@phobicismist zionist states of america is not the greatest country in the world anymore
Comment209	Amongst Democrats 😂
Comment210	The US is being invaded by millions of people every year and the troops are on the other side of the world, fighting in wars that are of no benefit to America. You couldn&#39;t make it up lol.
Comment 210.1	@JAMES WHITELEY No, it&#39;s kinda not. Don&#39;t forget your tin foil hat.
Comment 210.2	arjaygee it’s kinda common knowledge that the US created Al Qaeda in the 70’s lol. Now join your flock like a good sheep. Baahhhaa
Comment 210.3	@JAMES WHITELEY It is probably not worth debating a conspiracy theory that has been neither proven nor disproven.
Comment 210.4	arjaygee nothing available in Western MSM. The Times of Israel will be a better source. They’ve even been treating jihadis in their military hospitals. As for Al Qaeda, it’s common knowledge the US created them during the Cold War. If you didn’t know that, you’re probably not worth debating.
Comment 210.5	@JAMES WHITELEY And your authoritative sources for this bombshell are ....?
Comment211	Business, business... no hard feelings please
Comment212	I am a Syrian and want to say that the BBC is a lying machine. They lied about Syria since 2011 to suit the agenda of regime change. Most Syrians kurds and Arabs are relieved that the Syrian Army &quot;Assad&#39;s army&quot; is taking control of the North and North East. The BBC and all Western MSM have zero credibility.
Comment 212.1	Ana Suri - I&#39;m glad that you people are coming back together. I was against Trump pulling our US troops and abandoning the Kurds, and wanted us to stay and help them form their own country, but I guess if you Kurds are happy with rejoining Assad&#39;s government, it&#39;s all good.
Comment 212.2	@JAMES WHITELEY: thanks.
Comment 212.3	May you get your country back.
Comment213	Democrat party presidential debate last night really trash Trump for his Kurdish homeland policy. Crickets, not a word.
Comment214	The US troops will leave Syria when Netanyahu and his cabal say so.
Comment 214.1	"We had 50 u.s. soldiers that were relocated to Iraq. Ask the average American if we give a f<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ck"">#ck</a> about any of it.🤔"
Comment 214.2	JAMES WHITELEY <br />You just have trouble not being an idiot. What the surprise is how happy you are to show it. <br /><br />If you want to help the Kurds or Turks then buy a plane ticket
Comment 214.3	@e james ZIONAZIS THE ENEMY WITHIN ....<br />USS LIBERTY<br />9/11 the 5 dancing israelis<br />King david hotel bombing<br />The lavon affair<br />Spying on allies and stealing tech<br />Israel works with the bolshevik zionist ......vladimir putin
Comment 214.4	@Ari Onassis-Sugen uss liberty<br />9/11 the 5 dancing israelis you zionazi and enemy within
Comment 214.5	Don&#39;t be pathetic.
Comment215	Someone told me that 400 Turks has been killed so far and Erdogan tries to act cool and not let the media know it not sure why
Comment 215.1	@Dutch Strain AREN&#39;T THE TURKS TERRORIST KILLING AND BANNING KURDS?
Comment 215.2	The Home Office releases documents regarding PROSCRIBED ORGANISATIONS. Page 17 of the document (which you can access online) clearly states that in the United Kingdom the PKK is a terrorist organisation... I would be very careful who your admitted to associate with on a public platform
Comment 215.3	Kamil Alp  stop trying to speak smart all you media educated bums have no clue what is happening you guys are like the sheep to me because I have pkk friends and relatives bad they’re more happy than ever and told me everything I needed to know now get ur bummy thick head out of here and go fight for turkey if ur willing to die the Kurds has been fighting way longer than any army they’re the oldest fighters no wonder they couldn’t get wiped out with the worse weapons Turks kill innocent family’s and children right now in Syria and are Kurds no Kurds cane for revenge and is doing a better job so don’t get involved you sheep
Comment 215.4	Sad Orgasm that’s what the media wants you to believe I have pkk friends and they are more comfortable than ever they tell me how it’s going and it’s going great so don’t try try to people over the media like Erdogan
Comment216	45 a moron 4 sure
Comment217	Trump Bad president
Comment 217.1	OrangeManBad<br />War with NATO ally Turkey good<br />🤦‍♂️
Comment 217.2	No bad hombre.  Mucho grande Presidente!  El Jefe de Estados Unidos de America.
Comment218	God bless the president.  Fake news are on full pelt pre 2020 elections
Comment 218.1	@T S We were there to protect that area from ISIS, Iran, and Hezbollah. The idiot in the white house didn&#39;t even consult with the &quot;generals&quot; because he knows more than them. Erdogan told him to go f himself. What a guy! Creates the problem, then he solves it.
Comment 218.2	@jojo bean If only he had your great and unmatched wisdom to go to war with key NATO ally Turkey. In order to defend the YPG communist separatist terrorists... 🙄
Comment 218.3	@pablo9364 lol i dont need to watch BBC CNN ABC or whatever newsnetwork that has you triggered 24/7. Trumps own tweets is enough proof.
Comment 218.4	@pablo9364 lmao bro trump is incompetent regardless of your political ideology. Anyone whos isn&#39;t addicted to the smell of his farts can see that
Comment 218.5	Ali Zaidi is that so.  You arrived at that conclusion without being aware of all the facts! Wow you should work for bbc news
Comment219	Is this news or BBC comment?
Comment220	It&#39;s not a retreat you twit. WOW 50 American  Troops held back the hoards?
Comment 220.1	...held back the hordes*...
Comment 220.2	They did lol.  Why else did Turkey wait for the US to leave?
Comment221	The Russians must have some good kompromat on ol&#39; Donald...
Comment 221.1	The Russian collusion non-issue is a distraction by the left to divert attention from their hypocrisies in Ukraine &amp; other ME interests.<br />They&#39;re parading around in public pretending to care about genocide &amp; the environment while they fill their own countries with jihadis &amp; rapists &amp; block immigration by the victims of islamic genocide in the region!<br />And they&#39;ve got some sweet oil &amp; gas contracts going on for themselves in Ukraine.<br />Anyone who blindly believes leftist propaganda is a moron at this point.
Comment 221.2	@Jerry Vida I was being sarcastic. Muller was in La La land with the Dim&#39;s
Comment 221.3	@Khadr Trudeau you are still stuck on the fake. hoax made up. Proven a huge hoax case closed. You are still stuck in 2016.
Comment 221.4	You know they do and based on the intelligence gathering skills of the Turks established during the Khashoggi murder/assassination,  they probably do as well.
Comment222	So leave the ally that fought Isis and sent 1000 troops to Saudi Arabia which like Isis lite, ....A very stable genius indeed.
Comment 222.1	Much more stable than those demanding war with Turkey 🙄
Comment223	Very sad.
Comment224	Not our war.<br />We should have left years ago
Comment 224.1	rtorres81rc you are a brainless worm go get a clue or maybe a spine you weak dog smfh
Comment 224.2	@A Florida Son - We got attacked by al-Qaeda and we worked with al-Qaeda and their offshoots to overthrow Assad. So what? Are we supposed to stay being allied with al-Qaeda and Nusra Front?
Comment 224.3	Remember 9-11-2001? Not our war <b><i>in this moment,</i></b> but we can&#39;t walk around in blindfolds until America is once again attacked on our own soil. And if I knew there was a good chance that one of my friends were going to be attacked in their home, I wouldn&#39;t say, &quot;Better them than <b><i>me.&quot;</i></b> I would be on the offence. However, walking away and letting this happen, is what America, as a whole, is doing to our friends. And when <b><i>we</i></b> get attacked and call out to our friends, but they look away, it will be because of this type of selfishness. We need allies, but we cannot have allies if no one trusts us. Trump can toss his own friends under the bus, but it&#39;s not right, and doing it to America&#39;s friends and allies, is right down <b><i>un</i></b> American.
Comment 224.4	@Gambeeeno you said it. Bush was the CIA Chief in the late 70s stirring the pot. Then Iran contra.  Bush becomes president and NWO begins to finalize the next 30 years of presidents and deconstruction of the United States.  Trump is the first none puppet since Reagan.
Comment 224.5	Nah you should have never went to war in the middle east.
Comment225	Erdogan is frustratedly wanting for domination by massacring people.
Comment 225.1	Criticize him when your country welcomes 4 million refugees. No one wants refugees including Turkey.
Comment226	Charlie-Trump-Manson is the LITERAL Definition of a FASCIST KAKISTOCRACY.
Comment227	Make no mistake,<br />Charlie-Trump-Manson is more dangerous than a Catholic priest at a Cub scout meeting on epstein&#39;s island funded by ICE hosted by ISIS.<br /><br />All the sharpies in the world isn&#39;t going to help with this shit-hurricane.<br />Lmsao 😉<br />Good luck Charlie-Trump-Manson Supporters, you&#39;re going to need it.
Comment228	The BBC was in favour of war with Iraq too. The &#39;liberals&#39; who run this corrupt organisation seem to like wars.
Comment229	I think it&#39;s time for Germany, England, France, etc, to police the area.
Comment 229.1	@T S Maybe you ought to read yourself and laugh? He, Putin&#39;s boyfriend trump is putting &quot;sanctions&quot; against Turkey for something he himself created.  It must be so delicious living in your world.
Comment 229.2	@John Smith How can you not involve Germany..? Who do you think has the EU by the bollocks... It is all about Germany...
Comment 229.3	Britain and France were there with hundreds of special forces. They&#39;ve pulled out also. But of course everyone suffering from TDS is blaming Trump. As they think that he should have gone to war with NATO ally Turkey 🙄
Comment 229.4	let&#39;s not involve Germany, OK?
Comment 229.5	@kupar s Allies don&#39;t attack Turkey. The Kurd&#39;s were killing Turks thinking the Americans would protect them.
Comment230	Who cares .we will all be under water soon anyway.time to buy a big boat
Comment 230.1	Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh l like it
Comment 230.2	Weren&#39;t temperatures hotter a hundred years ago?
Comment231	The U.S. should amend the Constitution ( as if it&#39;s worth anything ) and bring Barak Obama back for an unprecedented 3rd term, didn&#39;t he win a Nobel Prize for peace ☮️ ?
Comment 231.1	Yes he did and well deserved. Obama&#39; is very smart and Trump is very dumb ad of course he said he would not wiin the Nobel because it was rigged. He didn&#39;t see that putting c
Comment 231.2	@A Florida Son An other fun fact is FDR vice president (Wallace) was a communist. Truman was only selected because FDR was dieing. Dimorats had to wait for Obama to get a communist in the White House. Some think Carter was a fellow traveler, but he was just plain dumb.
Comment 231.3	@hillbilly beer dranker Yes, Obama was an empty suit and pure evil. All he had to say was the Mubarak was a friend to America. But no, he&#39;s promoting terrorist. Still remember his Cari speech, this monster really hate the USA and humanity.
Comment 231.4	Khadr - Obama also backed the terrorists organization, Muslim brotherhood and helped them get into power in Egypt. The Egyptian military had to do a coup on the government and take back the country.
Comment 231.5	Yes he did, slaughtered 400K Iraqis, lost a won war, backed ISIS in Syria, destroyed Libya. Set race relation back 70 years. The Messiah, The One.
Comment232	There was only 27 US  troops removed  from northern Syria lol There was no massive pull out lol
Comment 232.1	@pablo9364 You ought to be ashamed. 5,000 troops are being deployed to help the country where most of the terrorists from 911 came from? Oh boy!
Comment 232.2	@jason okwaho  Your are real genius. What about the thousand of Air force and Navy backing them up. They are their as a trip wire and to call in hell.
Comment 232.3	jason okwaho bbc journalists are doing their best to affect the 2020 elections. Illegal bias and proof of corruption . BBC are the shame of Britain. Pedo coverups and fake news and support from a weak government. Britain is in a poor place right now but the government stay deluded.
Comment 232.4	jason okwaho they took 1000 out and put them into Iraq
Comment 232.5	the number has nothing to do with the value they have.  A handful of US soldiers can make a big difference.  Any foe knows that to attack them will  bring a full-scale US military response.  Token American forces in all kinds of hot spots serve as deterrence. i.e. between Israel &amp; Egypt.  In Korea. And more.   But perhaps the most horrible thing about Trumps recklessness is that he acted without consulting his own military.  And with no plan.  He&#39;s more dangerous to us (i.e. the USA) and our friends than to our enemies.
Comment233	No more wars for Israel.

Comment235	I wonder what kind of personal deal trump got away with? He never does anything without personal gain.  Maybe it&#39;s coming from Russia, Turkey or Syria.....or all three.  Ah, it&#39;s good to be the most criminal president in American history.
Comment 235.1	@JAMES WHITELEY you&#39;ve heard about the end days or the last days for years and now we are here. He is the antichrist and he is angering all of the other nations against the US. There isn&#39;t much time left. Give your life to Christ.
Comment 235.2	@Savedby Grace Muslim&#39;s can walk to Europe and they do. America has two oceans to protect us. As long as we keep the dimorats out of office were safe.
