Comment5	URGENT. CORBYN NEEDS NEW NAPPIES, HE SHAT THEM ALL AT THE THOUGHT OF AN ELECTION
Comment6	I voted for Labour in the past but will never vote for them again as long as Corbyn is its leader. He has no conviction and been sitting on <br />the Fence over Brexit far too long and now he want to go to bed with the EU! He wants to bounce his way to No. 10 - in his dream!
Comment7	The EU protects workers rights, tell that to the employees of ASDA and Amazon. Tell that to the French protestors. It seems to me that EU protection of workers is a myth, a bit of EU propaganda.
Comment8	Another useless Globslist. A number Niel Kinnock supporter, totally useless!
Comment9	This week I&#39;ve heard two MPs mention the extra day&#39;s work MPs have had to do this week. One, a tory said something along the lines of they should be paid extra, the other one, Jeremy Corbyn, thanked all those support staff that have come in to help them with their deliberations.

Comment18	I want to thank Corbyn for sticking up for business otherwise we would go bankrupt and our staff would lose jobs. You get our vote at general election jeremy.
Comment19	If Steptoe Snr becomes PM I say anyone young,  bright and ambitious, with the means and without ties preventing it, should emigrate while the going is good. If we are dumb enough to elect that clown, we are done and deserve our fate. Your future family will thank you.
Comment20	It is so annoying when Jeremy Corbyn speaks The Conservatives shout and roar like school children they do not want people to hear the truth
Comment21	Corbyn is a complete imbecile
Comment22	Corbyn wants no deal but won&#39;t say so.
Comment23	no deal is the logical next step
Comment24	God save UK from Corbyn
Comment25	Thank you very much üëç Jeremy Corbyn Labour is the reality of unity in diversity in Britain
Comment26	I don&#39;t accept the interpretation of Mr Corbyn!  For one thing he is - and has remained and will continue to be - a fanciful theorist and no fit leader for the Labour Party!  That theorism has typified the whole of it and has caused a severe lack of depth in it. Which means that I will be unable to trust it - accordingly!  He - and they - aren&#39;t on the surface yet. But in dangerous shallows. And not being able to manoeuvre adequately.  He is a quasi-irrelevancy as consequences of that.
Comment27	Boris has negotiated an exit agreement leading to negotiating a trade deal. That trade deal will never happen if Boris has his way. This is government fraud in action.
Comment28	i want a refund of my taxes you&#39;s are shite

Comment33	BBC gives more coverage to the opposition than the PM. Bloody Socialists.
Comment34	Jeremy corbyn you will regret this when the country vote
Comment35	Why is Priti Patel shaking her head and mouthing &quot;Rubbish&quot; when Corbyn reminds everyone of what Johnson did say about putting a border in the Irish Sea? He is on record as strongly  disapproving of such a move. There&#39;s a f&#39;ing video of him saying it! Why DOES she defend a proven liar??
Comment36	&quot;A cracking deal for Northern Ireland because they will have access to the Single Market&quot;. Well well well. Another cat out of the bag. It blows a big hole in the idea that the EU is not beneficial for the UK. WTF...???
Comment 36.1	The EU is not beneficial to anyone apart from those fortunate enough to be on its gravy train.
Comment37	Corbynov has proved himself to be completely useless and shouldn&#39;t be allowed anywhere near <br />No10.

Comment42	Joker treasonous prick
Comment43	Bunch of rats.
Comment44	Do not happy and relax labour, lib Dom. and EU people and block the end of this story Brexit will on no deal
Comment45	When Boris speaks he says it with a smirk like a school boy being sarcastic to the teacher.<br /><br />He is obviously chatting pure Bollox.
Comment46	Anything to get his self interest two bob‚Äôs in
Comment47	Boris you are grate pm you go my son you go !!!

Comment49	Look at the state of the labour benches. A collection mad idiotic marxist scum!
Comment50	Can&#39;t even stand this man&#39;s voice
Comment51	Ass hole
Comment52	So six Labour MP&#39;s voted Brexit , yet 5 million of the 17.4 million who voted leave were Labour voters, no wasted vote there then.
Comment53	His wrinkled face and voice give me anxiety.
Comment 53.1	Harold...I&#39;m an old man too old to go out on the horse and cart and too old to run the country
Comment54	Fight over a deal after we leave have you forgotten the 17.5million this is not about you lot fighting each other
Comment55	Britain should just leave the EU. Deal or no deal.
Comment56	Corbyn sounds like Adolf Hitler, no matter on which subject, he cant talk in a normal way
Comment 56.1	@Peter Livingstone he means negative dire .always with a caveat  .
Comment 56.2	He sounds nothing like Hitler. Bizarre statement.
Comment57	Ugh why the fuck is Corbyn not PM! Tired of conservative hacks like Johnson, give me a PM with a functioning brain!
Comment58	I voted labour for years, but I will never vote labour again whilst Jeremy corbyn is in it,  and the British people will remember what this guy is, at the next general election
Comment 58.1	I would rather the sun then the lying Daily Star
Comment 58.2	@Peter Livingstone no a rag and bone man
Comment 58.3	What is he ? A communist? <br /><br />Lol - stop reading the sun.
Comment59	When Theresa May was speaking she encouraged all to vote for the brexit  deal! All yelled yeah!!!!!!When Corbyn came up and encouraged all to vote against it they all yelled yeah!!!!! Do these people have their own minds? Or is this some British comedy I am watching!!
Comment60	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand yet again , the Queen in all her glory stays in the sidelines and says NOTHING, what a WASTE of currency the Royals are, they can&#39;t even stand up for the voter, all need to burn in hell!!
Comment 60.1	@Old Guy That&#39;s not true and is actually a gross oversimplification of both our political system and the situation we are in. We have a parliamentary, representative democracy. We vote for our representatives, who argue on our behalf in parliament and are supposed to do what they consider best for the country. We don&#39;t have direct democracy. Everything has to be debated in parliament, which is sovereign. What you are saying is that you want an unelected figurehead to step in and override our democracy because you don&#39;t like the result that our parliamentary system has provided. Well, that&#39;s not how it works, my friend. <br /><br />And anyway, as the terms of the referendum were not clear i.e., the terms of leaving were not set out beforehand, and in fact many people are now lying about the type of Brexit they campaigned for, there has to be debate in parliament regarding the type of exit we will have, how we can limit the damage (because let&#39;s face it, Leavers gave up talking about actual, concrete merits ages ago once it became clear there aren&#39;t any), and if it&#39;s even possible to deliver it without massive damage being done.<br /><br /><br />The Royals should fuck right off, though. That much we agree on. They have no place in a modern democracy.
Comment 60.2	@timcritt Under &#39;normal&#39; circumstances i would 100% agree with you, but these traitors need to be pulled in line, the VOTER is the master and these clowns are mean&#39;t to fulfill the will of the VOTER.
Comment 60.3	Their role is purely ceremonial. Do you really want an unelected monarch stepping in? Come off it.
Comment61	Johnson has money on making sure the UK leaves. BBC you can‚Äôt just ignore this, where have all your fantastic investigating reporters gone.
Comment 61.1	What fantastic investigative reporters ?? The BBC is biased corrupt to it&#39;s rotten core. I just watched a video of them reporting about the people marching on saturday oh 1 million marching in support of the remoaners ! NOT ! one single shot of those in favour of Brexit ! The BBC mandate it to report with neutrality and that was anything but neutrality in the best tradition of  Goebbels.
Comment62	Corbyn had already made his mind up that Labour was going to vote against the deal, before it had even been announced. All they are doing is playing, it has nothing to do with Brexit¬† but is all about getting Boris what ever the cost. We don&#39;t need people like this running our country, we want people who will do what is best for it, people who have intelligence, integrity, honour and who believe in Britain.
Comment 62.1	Yes they got the script of the deal the day before but not all of it so they have all seen the deal bad deal as far as I can see
Comment63	Each nation has their betrayers! For cheap labor, Those betrayers are even  willing to import terroists !!!
Comment64	Commie
Comment65	Working on a Saturday poor things, did they get time and a half
Comment66	nice comedy
Comment67	Corbyn go grow potatoes and you can share it with the Irish.
Comment68	Jeremy Corbyn the jellyfish Labor shit.
Comment69	I think cornyn came in jjb sports one time before it went into administration lmao! Yeah they sacked me! For being too truthful about daz the manager&#39;s fat pervy sister! What a stalker! She quit her job across the street so she could stand perving on me all day! I lost my job for sticking up for myself!  &quot;SEXUAL HARASSMENT MUCH&quot;  It was absolutely gross! Like she had her ugly pig tongue down my throat all dayüò£  I&#39;m pretty sure some guy who looked like corbyn was pulling strings with people and making my life a stalking hell, they probably even asked the garbage truck men to go through my trash weekly to see if they found anything interesting! I dunno who this corbyn guy is but I think maybe him or some lookalike was related to some girl called fake sophie from borders bookshop? Fake and a liar. I had no intention to give her an ounce of attention but she tricked me into it with her &quot;i&#39;m begging you look&quot; in her eyes and hands grasped together! What a geek and a fake!<br />Fake to get by in life.
Comment70	Amazing how they all seem so satisfied that they actually worked on a weekend (For the first time since the early 80s). Bunch of lazy good for nothings.
Comment71	Resign.
Comment72	How a Jeremy Corbyn can quote unattributable economic analyses is beyond me, he regularly puts Diane Abbot up to explain where the money is coming from for extra Police etc, he has zero economic credibility!
Comment73	We got ‚ÄúDO NOTHING‚Äù Communists in office too... hopefully our coup ends before yours. üá¨üáßüá∫üá∏üá¨üáßüá∫üá∏üá¨üáßüá∫üá∏

Comment79	It should have read DONT GIVE Labour Party a blank cheque
Comment80	Jeremy Corbyn is a vile creature, I can‚Äôt wait for him to quit his position so I can vote for Labour again.
Comment81	Brexiteers are patiently waiting. That&#39;s why it always seems like there are large crowds supporting remain. They will push people to a flash point before long. They are lucky parliament is in London and not elsewhere.
Comment82	WHAT A COMEDY SHOW, AND A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. GO BACK TO THE PEOPLE AND THEN CARRY OUT THEIR WISHES PROMPTLY, IN MY OPINION, BRITAIN IS LOST AND AS FOR Corbyn, I REST MY CASE.
Comment83	banning the live export of animals? o&#39;oh, the meat market is going to crash big time. great opportunity for vegetarian companies to slander our lack of regulations in their marketing spiel.
Comment84	Labour is playing political games gambling with the country!<br />If they want Brexit to go through, they have to vote for the deal!<br />If Labour does not want Brexit to pass, call for general election what they won‚Äôt do as well!<br />So, what do you want?<br /><br />Also, voting on Saturday? When the market is closed? How irresponsible is that?!
Comment 84.1	The conservatives did that with the Brexit vote in the first place, your point must be all politicians are only in it for themselves?

Comment91	Old Corbyn will not be getting a cheque but will soon be getting his P45 as all half decent Labour people know. The proof will be in the polls at the next election.
Comment92	Aww Poor old Corbyn having to keep lying when he is actually against the EU &amp; always has been, Just check his record, <br />Problem here is Corbyn is being told by the unions what he can &amp; can&#39;t do. Nothing new there then is there.? <br />That is the only reason they keep Corbyn where he is, It stops themselves from being visible.<br />Corbyn has lived his whole life anti establishment, <br />This is his golden oppotunity to leave the EU, <br />First class coward, Always has been always will be!<br />Liebour are finished &amp; to be fair can&#39;t blame it all on &quot;Corbyn&quot; Only. <br />The left in this country are so out of touch with the people of this country, Just like the Biased BBC, <br />When you hear idiots refer to Boris as far right?

Comment95	His  own brother, a expect in climate campaigns against this bullshit , that man made climate change is a nonesense
Comment96	The voters gave Tony Blair a blank cheque and he wasted every penny of our pension fund and now this creep talks of open cheques. Labour and the TUC love immigration and a open door policy , people in well paid secure jobs don&#39;t vote labour or join unions, people on zero hour short term contracts working slave labour condition do, Labour loves your poverty
Comment97	We should take them to court to have a General Election. They are running our country but did not win.
Comment 97.1	@bob rail wouldn&#39;t be so sure

Comment112	"The only way to true peace and everlasting happiness for each one of us (each as individuals, but united in spirit) is to ‚ÄúLove your neighbour as yourself‚Äù and to reject all religions.

You will recognize them by the fruits they bear.‚Äù ‚Äì (at Matthew 7: 15-16) ‚Äì   <br /><br />‚ÄúDo not call any man on earth ‚Äòfather‚Äô; for you have one Father and he is in heaven.

Comment 112.1	One minute the narrative was &#39;You cannot take us out of the EU without a deal, that will be disastrous to the british economy&#39;; now after a deal is secured the new narrative is &#39;this deal is disastrous for the UK&#39;. Come on folks, let common sense prevail. It&#39;s this simple....You must honour the thousands who vote leave, nevermind a narrow margin on the leave-remain votes. If the referendum vote had gone the other way, that result would have been upheld. What kind of democracy is this? Surely  we do not want a disorderly brexit, it is bad for business and the economy. The prime minister I believe has done the unthinkable  by getting rid of the backstop which was a key issue all along.  I am just fed up with the whole brexit thing.
Comment113	"I voted out.  But now since i learned so much over the past 3 years, I want to vote again.  And I want to remain in Europe. <br />Please, give me and the Country another chance to decide again, now that we are all better educated on the matter."

Comment 117.1	That is Hezbollah you are trying to spell. While Bojo was giving ¬£100 Million of our taxes to ISIS/alnusra White Helmets Jihadist fake news criminals, brave and courageous Hezbollah fighters have spent 7 years fighting against ISIS and alnusra in defense of the secular Syrian state.
Comment118	You are not fit to be a party leader Corbyn <br />Leave means Leave
Comment119	Does Great Britain have any concept of how ridiculous it is making itself appear? A vote to leave was held. A move to leave is being countered by Corbyn. What ever happened to majority rule? Time to just crash out and let the chips fall where they may. Give the electorate exactly what it voted for.
Comment 119.1	@Wuotans Krieger dude 17million people voted for leave and 16 million peopel voted stay, in the UK their are 66 million population.<br />A large number of people didn¬¥t even bother to vote cause they like the status Quo.  <br />Those who like the status Quo wouldn¬¥t like the life changing events. <br />So their isn¬¥t even a majority in the UK consensus for the referendum.<br />Let that sink in.
Comment 119.2	@knowledge share Where are you getting your &#39;figures&#39; from? Only 16,141,241 voted against leaving, not 46,000,000!
Comment 119.3	Out of 63 Million Brits 46 Million did NOT vote for BREXIT !
Comment 119.4	It did not vote for chaos!
Comment120	Just do a new election for fucks sake! It is obvious the British government is not able to furfill a good deal Brexit, therefore the Referendum doesn&#39;t count anymore.
Comment121	The British government informs.<br />Parliament has betrayed the interests of Great Britain. Facebook rioting advertising is funded by Soros from abroad.<br />Elizabeth II is disappointed with British politicians and prosecutors.<br />October 31, hard Brexit. All other conversations in the status of an independent state.<br /><br />62% of Britons support Brexit without a deal with the European Union.<br />Go out and defend Britain! Give kulak traitors the face!<br />The London prosecutor&#39;s office is obliged to start checking why the referendum law in the UK is not implemented.

Comment123	<i>A vote for this deal would be a vote to cut manufacturing jobs.</i><br /><br />The vote to leave the EU did that.<br /><br />All the bad things besides the impact on climate change is caused by leaving the EU.
Comment124	Corbinoff is the epitome of a worthless useless incompetent stupid old fool......never had one single positive thought in his empty Communist socialist halfwit head.
Comment125	EU is the most prosperous single market. Why leave? sorry, it is bad economics.
Comment126	I wish they&#39;d just get on with it, what&#39;s the point in a democracy if MPs simply dont do what the people want. Further still, they now insinuate that were all stupid! Get on with the will of the people!
Comment 126.1	@UNRooted RC I agree this should&#39;ve been done a long time ago, I personally can&#39;t think why it wasn&#39;t obvious before the implementation of the first referendum, but clearly it wasn&#39;t thought about. <br /><br /><br />Really it should&#39;ve been a dual referendum in the first implementation where one would be a consultation on remain or leave and then a general election for parties to allow negotiations with a party that represents the will of that leave vote then a confirmation on the deal with the option of remain had the deal been worse than what we have, had that been the known path before the first referendum I doubt it would&#39;ve taken as long or caused as much trouble and division amongst the people.<br /><br /><br />I voted remain, I respect the result of the first referendum, I don&#39;t respect the idea of the referendum giving weight to any deal given how vague it was and how people had a variety of ideas about what that actually meant(maybe had the 2017 general election given a majority government I would have respected it but then it would&#39;ve passed a deal anyway), which is why the only fix I can see is a legally binding referendum based on the deal we have available to us now.
Comment 126.2	@MrDJLaw if that&#39;s the process then lets get it done. why this wasn&#39;t done earlier though only serves to make me and many others very suspicious of our system. It does feel like our system is set up so that a few can steer the people to their will rather than the other way around. but, i guess, if you look at British history, that&#39;s the way are system has always worked.
Comment 126.3	@UNRooted RC It was never going to be as simple as just leaving, I see this as the expected outcome of our legislature with a slim majority and now minority government, my hope is we get a confirmatory referendum that is binding, so the result is already legally implemented upon the result, which was not possible in the first referendum due to us having to trigger Article 50 to negotiate a withdrawal agreement in the first place. But now we have that agreement we can put that to the people and either they vote to remain, or leave then if leave wins again a both options of no-deal or Johnshons deal, so everyone gets a say on the final outcome.
Comment 126.4	@MrDJLaw well if i remember correctly it was simply to leave the EU but our parliament have never backed that, not once have they allowed themselves to rise above their own personal gain/ambition  to get the job done. now, if the people vote on this again, hopefully they will execute in a timely mannar
Comment 126.5	In your enlightened view of the UK, what is your interpretation of &quot;the will of the people&quot;?

Comment136	I think we‚Äôre running into what was known in football as ‚ÄòFergie time‚Äô.
Comment137	Would be nice if labour stood by an actual policy rather than just childishly throwing out their toys from the pram at whatever the government proposes
Comment 137.1	Labour don&#39;t  know want ?
Comment 137.2	@Peter Livingstone No the opppsition should be realistic about their standards of a deal. They don&#39;t want no deal yet they continue to set impossible standards for what is acceptable considering we are negotiating against most of the continent. Theresa Mays deal wasn&#39;t great, but it was the best we were realistically ever going to get. At this point if the opposition don&#39;t accept the terms of the deal, then they should call a general election and run a campaign off of cancelling Brexit, except Courbyn values his career over being solid and useful opposition
Comment 137.3	@Ethan Martin - have you read Boris&#39; deal? Should the opposition just back <b>whatever</b> deal?
Comment 137.4	@prague pete nope mearly a man wishing for the day when we get some actually decent opposition rather than the usual speal and charades of Jeremy Courbyn as he feigns the idea that he has so many wonderful ideas yet still has not called for a general election? Why? Because Courbyn is willing to watch this country crash and burn to further his own career

Comment 139.1	@Richard W What on earth are you talking about? My wages did not increase from 2008-2016 due to the austerity imposed upon the public sector whilst everyone else enjoyed pay rises which consequently affected my pension. If you care to check the latest data from the ONS pay rises are beating inflation. The fact that you appear to want to reintroduce Victorian conditions of employment speaks volumes for your Toryphile politics and your apparent hatred of genuine socialism.
Comment 139.2	@Wuotans Krieger Perhaps it is time to adjust to modern times. Wages have stagnated and the cost of living keeps increasing; you were obviously working during the golden age.
Comment 139.3	@Richard W I am retired but even when I worked full time I was not stupid enough to work 6 or 7 days a week. This is 2019 not 1819!
Comment 139.4	@Wuotans KriegerParliament may only be open at the weekend but I dare say it is manned 24 -7.<br />Regarding your question, I often work 6 or 7 days a week, don&#39;t you?
Comment 139.5	Are you really that dim? Parliament is only open for business 5 days a week. This has nothing to do with Mr Corbyn or anyone else. It is a matter of convention. He was imply extending a courtesy towards the staff of Parliament.  Do you work 6 or even 7 days a week?
Comment140	Not deal Boris Johnson you just interest in be elected by 2020!
Comment141	Great.  I want a no deal
Comment142	Schools out for Autumn Saturday right for arguing Lead us on Boris and be the poorer for it all
Comment143	Corbyn doesn&#39;t realise quite how infantile he is. <br /><br />Very low quality and stunted human being. He is simply not aware of his low status. He has never known what it&#39;s like to be very bright so hates those that are. A very nasty little Man.
Comment 143.1	You read it right. Corbyn is an infantile piece of low grade scum. He has no idea of the absurdity of his politics. He is too dim witted.
Comment 143.2	What a silyl little boy you are!

Comment 145.1	His name is not Boris. it&#39;s Alexander. He was born in America and his grandparents were from Turkey. He only renounced his American citizenship three years ago when they (the US) asked him to pay tax. Still trust this liar..?
Comment146	No deal is the only deal.<br /> Leave now, make deals later, with the EU, if they wish to continue trading with the UK on a level field
Comment 146.1	What the hell are you tslking about the UK already trades on a level playing field it&#39;s called the single market. What you have said is the UK must leave to then go back to what they already have.
Comment147	Lies nothing but lies and scaremongering from Corbyn go tend your allotment you vacuous traitor you don‚Äôt care about people and jobs you want everyone dependant on the state that‚Äôs why you welcome immigrants with nothing to offer  but a dependency on the state  handouts

Comment150	Jeremy Corbyn and the Blairites this is Tony Blair talking
Comment151	Corbyn is a borderline communist plain and simple. Together with the SNP who want freedom from the UK while being subservient to the EU makes for a basket case parliament that is incapable of democracy. Time for an election
Comment 151.1	Patrick Webster - cobyn is anti Semitic, pro politically correct bloke that defends the rights of shamina begum a jihadi bride who went out to Syria to support the murderous, wicked islamist terrorist group isis. He is a ditherer, extremely left wing, always sits on the fence, spineless. To be concise he is a communist dress in a suite. Beware people of Britain, believe in your country trust your gut feeling we will prosper &amp; achieve greater things without being held back by many leeches from across the Channel. Our national identity is cardinal &amp; &amp; our sovereign democracy should never be compromised.

Comment 157.1	Peter Livingstone I feel your comment is irrelevant here
Comment 157.2	@Jordan Patterson <br /><br />Call it bullshit all you like. Have you read the conditions of the latest deal ? He was simply telling us what was in the latest deal.
Comment 157.3	Wuotans Krieger Mr Corbyn, like you know him! Am guessing you are all for him and what he stands for? And listen to all the bullshit that comes from his and every other MPs mouth
Comment 157.4	@Jordan Patterson You may not be but Mr Corbyn was and you would or should have known that if you had listened to what he actually said!
Comment158	Why can&#39;t Corbyn advise the prime minister?.Do he have to say no to every deal?.Can he come up with a better deal?.Why does he not respect the past referendum to leave the European Union.?
Comment 158.1	@Wuotans Kriegercan you explain to me how it works.?
Comment 158.2	You clearly do not understand how parliamentary politics work!
Comment159	Many criticise and will continue to criticize BREXIT as a political crisis but to me it&#39;s a good thing, it taught the whole world some very good lessons, it&#39;s a reminder to the modern world how democracy really works. As a person who embrace democratic values, I respect UK people for its BREXIT referendum, I respect for the two prime ministers who has the guts to resign when they knew there own way is not working, I respect the Supreme Court&#39;s verdict on the suspension of parliament case. Even after more that 300 years since the Glorious Revolution, UK has a lot more to offer to other nations. You guys are making history here, godspeed UK stay strong

Comment 160.2	‚Äã@Jim Goodwin and I also Speak From a  logistics and supply chain management  background. BUT Corbyn  IS not point  Government So has now Power meaning he could not do anything the Government are ones ruining the show
Comment 160.3	@T D <br />Would it make any difference?<br />I very much doubt it - we speak from a manufacturing, export &amp; import company experience - what do you do?<br />Corbyn has done nothing but sit on the fence, incapable of making the simplest decision, meanwhile, companies like mine have ridden a roller coaster of uncertainty....... <br />Give me one example when Corbyn has ever, agreed or voted with the government...?
Comment 160.4	Jim Goodwin  Please do explain to me how the leader of the opposition who is in government is to blame for all the indecisiveness that‚Äôs been going on the government controls the order page but the government are the ones who control what‚Äôs going on in Westminster on a day to  today basis retainment been a delay do you think that that the lady is called maybe because the government are the ones who can‚Äôt negotiate considering that this deal by Nigel Farage has been pointed out to be even worse than Theresa May‚Äòs deal
Comment 160.5	@Wuotans Krieger No, absolutely not but every time we have a delay, our exports / sales dip - its getting beyond a yoke and Corbyn is mostly to blame......
Comment161	What does Steptoe know about working people? He&#39;s never had a job in his life. Mummy and daddy gave him an allowance when he left his private school. He is a complete waste of space. Talks a load of crap as well.

Comment 164.1	VOTE AGAIN like the scottishe plan to do. till they get the result they wanted.<br />Isn¬¥t that what the Britishe delegation in the EU told the Irish people when their referenrum didn¬¥t go the correct way. <br /><br /><br />Oh my I do have a long memory.

Pull it together U.K., we are watching.
Comment 178.1	@Dashcam Videos I&#39;m so sorry to hear that. I want America to heal too. The referendum to leave or stay in the EU was a major piece of British history. Something as important as that causes a split. It was bound to happen. However, there&#39;s a load of media hype out there blowing it all out of proportion. Once the Brexit issue is dealt with we&#39;ll see a quieting down between people. Scotland wants independence from the Westminster government, not the other countries of these islands. They have constantly ignored us and the people in the North of England too. Everything revolves around London and the South East of England. Even the English people know that. You know, the ordinary Joe Public. This has been coming for years. So many are so angry right now. üò¢
Comment 178.2	Carol Strachan I just wish you all weren‚Äôt so divisive like here in the US.  We are like the new kids and you all are ancient.  I understand us being jerks but I never expected you all to be so split.  I hope you all can come together soon.  For the good of the world.  We are like a lost hope right now.
Comment 178.3	Dashcam: I live in a town in Scotland where there are NO butchers and no farms that sell anything. This is a supermarket country where only the well off can afford to actually seek out a butcher or a farm. We do have high standard supermarkets though and they sell British goods. I won&#39;t buy anything else. All this guff about the EU  is being so bad, in Scotland we&#39;ve seen higher standards come in from them and our own government. I&#39;m 63 and can vouch for that. You don&#39;t have to buy American if you don&#39;t want to. The Scottish government will see to that.
Comment 178.4	Don‚Äôt let them touch your NHS.  We have people here in the US that go bankrupt because of medical debt.  They are left with nothing.  A lot of them die because of the scam of health insurance in our country.  Guard your healthcare system.  You do not want to end up like the US.
Comment 178.5	The guys a cock
Comment179	So, for the PM&#39;s speech the BBC just headlines it as such, for the Leader of Britain&#39;s Nazi Left, it puts what it thinks is the stand out Remoan take out in the headline title.  The BBC, biased for Remoan, and with some notable exceptions, the Lord Haw Haw of Britain&#39;s Nazi Left.
Comment180	British ?????
Comment181	Thank goodness the MPs were smart enough not to destroy the economy just to satisfy the demands of an ignorant mob.
Comment 181.1	they nearly did but were strong and will leave and thrive ,,
Comment182	Well said Jeremy Corbyn .. Boris Johnson&#39;s tone of being polite and caring about th British people should fool noome ... this is the man who ied during his brexit campaign, anyone who thinks he is not telling lies now has not done their research
Comment 182.1	SUKI MANN are you amerexican or a media sponge ,
Comment183	It&#39;s a treaty  it&#39;s not a deal  it&#39;s a beginning.  Do these undemocratic   useless  mps have no faith  in a Britain  outside  the EU. Do you have no faith in your abilities  you need the eu  to tell you what  to  do
Comment 183.1	Well facts speak louder then opinions doesn¬¥t it. 3 years all cause a none legal binding referendum. stupidity at it¬¥s highest level. <br />But the LAW it says so in the LAW.
Comment184	Corbyn..<br />U need to stop smoking  crack and start to come into  the  real world..listen to the  people  understand  that all UK  residents  have had enough..<br />Corbyn I  don&#39;t  no what your thinking but grow up..<br /><br />I would  love to see  a punch up between  corbyn  and Boris..<br /><br />Who would  win?<br /><br />My money  is on  Boris..

Comment187	I don&#39;t get it, they want the perfect deal they are never going to get. They simply don&#39;t want any deal they want to remain and I hope boris gets us out no matter what.
Comment 187.1	sun reading moron
Comment 187.2	Plexversal ‚ÄúI want to lose my rights no matter what‚Äù is what ur saying. Remaining is GOOD
Comment188	At least half of these MP&#39;s are acting like convicted prisoners on death row, frantically getting their lawyers to partition for a few more days extension in the ever more vain hope that the, hany them flog them, governor, will permanently commute their sentence. &quot;Yet the day is fast approaching when not even these turkeys, can prevent Christmas.&quot; The people want out, and in reality have always wanted out, as they never wanted in, in the first place, and were not asked. The effects of project fear, are gradually wearing off, and even The EU itself is rapidly abandoning the Remain cause. At some time, and likely sooner rather than later, project fear, will be exposed for what it was, which was insensible scaremongering of the worst and most dishonestly destructive kind, and many of these buggers, will be finally be show up to be nothing more then highly self-interested, therefore corrupted, politically motivated, profoundly treacherous ideologues, with not the slightest consideration for the completely unnecessary, worry and psychological suffering they have caused, many of the ,most vulnerable people within the nation. There entire credibility will be shot, as many of them should also be, and in former times, would have been, or much, much worse.

Comment190	if parliament is set to vote if Mr.Johnson s name is Boris , he would lose with huge margin
Comment 190.1	Well, what about Alexander de Pfeffel?
Comment191	He does not know the meaning of being honest let alone know how to spell the word.¬† He is a liar, he hates our Armed Forces, he is without doubt the most dishonourable MP I have ever seen.¬† I cannot stand this man let alone listen to his crap.¬† My opinion only but I am sure it will not be the last thing said by others.
Comment192	The first weekend in 37 YEARS. Shame on Corbyn Don&#39;t appreciate the millions who work Saturdays and Sundays 52 weeks of every year .
Comment 192.1	thick sun reading moron
Comment 192.2	What on earth has the working hours of parliament to do with the Leader of the Opposition?
Comment193	Corbyn is a disgusting liar! He promised in 2017 GE to respect the referendum result and NOT to have a second referendum. Some 5 million labour voters who voted to leave the EU and supported Corbyn in 2017 have been betrayed.
Comment 193.1	@Karl Marx The Bolshevik Rabbi honest well said,
Comment 193.2	@Simon Machin Yes, indeed! I&#39;m on the far-left, but I have no respect for Labour Party.
Comment 193.3	He&#39;s a piece of shit
Comment194	Boris and Trump, these two are totally insane and mad dog
Comment 194.1	its not trump thats the problem its stupid unintelligent americans that are the problem fake news bias press we at least know shite when we see it ,trump would have sorted this 3 years ago ,,your the problem not trump,,

Comment196	I struggle watching Jeremy Corbyn, proper scumbag.
Comment197	About 52% of referendum voters screwed the UK by voting to leave the EU.
Comment 197.1	@rant404 its all if,s and buts with you ,
Comment 197.2	@Simon Machin I&#39;m a Yank. For years now I&#39;ve been watching Britain try to pull its finger out when it never should have had a finger up its rectum to begin with.
Comment 197.3	@Simon Machin rim owners will do any thing but for the ,,eu and not britain so odd ,
Comment 197.4	You people still hammering that project fear huh.
Comment198	Britain needs to understand that it cannot have the cake and eat it too.

Comment 198.3	@John boy true,
Comment 198.4	Miche√°l √ì Coisdealbha wicked comment üëå
Comment199	When you realize no matter what deal he came with they would block it.just crash out
Comment 199.1	You are a gentleman and a scholar. Good day to you
Comment 199.2	@sausagechops Yeah I&#39;m not wasting anymore time on this you can put another mark on your internet debate tally sheet if you like, don&#39;t hold your breath on us ever leaving though.
Comment 199.3	@sausagechops You see nonsense replies only deserve the equivalent in return, maybe you should explain WHY it would be divisive or how it erodes democracy before just stating it as though it were a matter of fact but your only reasoning is &quot;You lost. End of. There‚Äôs more numbers in the working classes who support leave than the Home Counties crew who want to remain.&quot; reality changes, facts change, people adapt and change their mind polling indicates much the opposite of what you merely claim from some wishful thinking &quot;More would turn out next time.&quot; they wouldn&#39;t apathetic voters don&#39;t care, the only people voting against leave now are those who were easily swayed in the first referendum, not everybody is a die hard like you pal.
Comment 199.4	@sausagechops Not sure how it could divide us anymore than we already are, no such thing as too much democracy. I get it you don&#39;t want your original vote wasted, but guess what I&#39;m sure even better options will be available on the next referendum like no-deal. It will lose but, at least you get to waste your vote again.
Comment 199.5	@sausagechops It&#39;s really not that hard to make a binding referendum, Johnson just needs to allow a referendum on his deal in order for it to pass, then the people can reject it.
Comment200	Corbyn thinks he has won. But labour has won nothing
Comment 200.1	they will pay dearly for this ,their anti britain / british stance is shameful .

Comment 203.3	Manic 23 IRA killed soldiers doing there job, should. Have killed electricians that would have had more impact, Ira = Irish üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ there Catholic bought by the church the pope, who rule them.......REAL Irish ‚òòÔ∏è = Druid Celt pagan that‚Äôs Irish, but they were wiped out by Catholic Church, then when henry fell out with the church Protestant, more chance of being Irish ,,,, he felt sorry for the Ira who cowardly attacks, and caused chaos, of course Maggie met the Ira , she was stuck with them,, but the Ira wouldn‚Äôt name members but had speakers, blow the British up üòÇüòÇüòÇ they were wiped out by the Catholic Church,  most people don‚Äôt follow religion now,, they follow social media
Comment 203.4	The Torys have actual ex IRA members in its party in places of power...Thatcher  talked  with the IRA in secret for years ..go read something thats not the Daily Mail......right wing culture is destroying your brain..
Comment 203.5	@Brian Wilkinson Good luck with that vote. If he gets the key 2 no 10 this country is more than screwed. Be interesting 2 see how many numpties will admit they voted for him then. Thought not they will run like smelly trairors.
Comment204	Boris should be drug tested on the spot.
Comment 204.1	@stephen isom ol&#39; Victor will be a traitor and votes labour. He must hate them Jews and democracy.
Comment 204.2	er ok give in why ,
Comment205	What about simplifying the situation by asking the people of England,Wales and Scotland if they want Northern Ireland to remain in the UK.N Ireland seem to have trouble choosing whether they are part of the UK or part of the EU. shouldn&#39;t London with a population of 10 million be given as much attention as NI given that London also voted to remain.
Comment 205.1	@bob rail I think you mean Londonistan and given that only about 2% of the population of Londonistan come from anywhere ending in stan you&#39;ve probably been reading the Sun too much.that doesn&#39;t answer the NI question though where about .001 % of the population come from anywhere ending in stan.
Comment 205.2	Well of course LONDONSTANI voted to remain don&#39;t think it&#39;s called LONDONSTANI for nothing do you üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©
Comment206	There is no good Brexit no matter how much you debate about it.
Comment 206.1	@Tilahun Girma have a look at how many times we have tried to veto and then look at how many we have got ,its 0...on paper in reality pffft .its taken 3,5 years to try and leave thats the hold they have on us ,
Comment 206.2	@pat dunne Yes when people first voted they did not know much  but now people are much better informed about Brexit.
Comment 206.3	@stephen isom What you say is not correct, as far as I know because the UK has a veto power in the EU. Anything it does not agree with it can reject it. The EU can not impose its will. But  the problem with Brexit now is that the Brexiters do not want to be even in the Common Market, even if what you say was true.
Comment 206.4	@Tilahun Girma when we were in the common market yes ,,then they ruined it by making it political and now 27 countries are governed by unknown people who if you do not agree you have no way of sacking them like our mp,s will be getting sacked shortly ,for there inept ,positions and for ignoring the voters we can and will sack them,, ,how do i sack the ,,eu,,,
Comment 206.5	@Tilahun Girma He does not know what an economy is like most brexiteers . Next referendum needs a mandatory IQ test  before been allowed  to vote
Comment207	Fk you corbyn
Comment208	Praying for the UK it&#39;s a sad thing to see your nation fighting against itself, a very terrible thing. God save us all.
Comment 208.1	@Joe South I agree. Maybe a lot of those EU nationals that would&#39;ve been coming here for a free ride might end up in Ireland instead and see how mr Dunne likes that.
Comment 208.2	Not our nation really  well half of it is the other half well thats a mixture of foreign workers ,migrant and terrorist &amp; scroungers here for the free ride, was not the people of this country that started the last three wars it was our governments, so i glad our boarders are closing and we are so doing the right thing too go like the ozzies and tighten up our ship ,I‚Äôm watching shit fall apart in my home town there are  too many religions too and one being forced, pushed on people ,Islam!!, your all crazy giving your life &amp; time too these dirty practices , religion is man made bullshit to control idiotic people , for sure the uk is turning into shit pit
Comment 208.3	Oh if you say praying to the DEVIL will help then. eh the Devil says am tired of the western pron society. they are too stupid that whatever I write in a contract like EULA get signed and used right away. world is getting too boring with only stupid servants.
Comment 208.4	Why should GOD save you, when you have a FREE WILL. <br />You voted with your free will the total stupidity without even basic research.<br />This after you all asked we want INFORMATION FOR ALL.. <br />Now god has to save you cause you were too lazy to do some work?<br /><br /><br />Gee God has beter things to do like oh look in China a evil regime lifted 800 million people out of poverty.. hmm that is too EVIL that a regime lifts people out of poverty to give them the world power..<br />Wait but but, yeah it is also available in your information for all requested. :P
Comment 208.5	pat dunne another anti-british buffoon. If you think for one second the UK could ever ¬´¬†implode¬†¬ª you really haven‚Äôt got much of a grasp on History...
Comment209	Dont give a blank check!you bloody lot have taken everything election now filth

Comment213	Chlorine washed chicken?
Comment 213.1	@Wuotans Krieger no its not its a media pop at trump and the british government ,and nuclear power stations are just fine ,wake up ..
Comment 213.2	@stephen isom The real issue here is allowing food products which are below standard into the United Kingdom which are likely to prove harmful to public health.
Comment 213.3	@Wuotans Krieger well if you live on only chicken you have more to worry about than what the kill salmonella with maybe you would rather die from that ,,pffft,
Comment 213.4	@knowledge share This must not be allowed to happen. Let us also not forget that they have their greedy eyes upon the NHS too!

Comment218	Don&#39;t give PM a blank cheque, he might think it&#39;s in the EU!
Comment219	üëéBoris is a crook<br />Jeremy Corbin is a Heroüëç
Comment 219.1	Cristina Lexy,  Jeremy Corbyn is a Marxist who sided with Russia over his own<br />country when they attempted to poison Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury<br />with Novichok,  they also poison two British nationals in Amesbury with the same<br />nerve agent,  causing the death of Dawn Sturgess.<br /><br /><br />What makes him a hero??  he lied to me and the other 17.4 million Brexiteers in the<br />2017 general election by promising to deliver Brexit,  now he has betrayed us and<br />wants to remain in a crumbling union.  he may be your hero,  but he&#39;s not our hero.
Comment 219.2	because answers below we wont hold our breaths ,you are a spy for the beano must be true ,,see child .
Comment220	LABOURS POSITION IS QUITE CLEAR  it is to do nothing in particular say nothing of substance,and have no agenda ,to have no one answer for any thing ,and just sit there say and NO///NO///AND NO///so they are empty spoilers spoiling for the pure vengeance , and the vinegar rhetoric to deny the tory party its place in history ,they will go to any lengths even if it hurts britain and the british ,a vile group who no longer represent any one,.or any thing,

Comment222	history books will not be kind to this commie piece of shit
Comment223	What an idiot this man is FFS
Comment224	So Parliament have gone against the people again. They have no respect for the people or the democratic voting system.
Comment 224.1	@M Lawson Oh boy you put it to them both, they should go read up RULES and LAWS first ,and then the consequences.<br />And Cameron resigning should already have given them a clue.<br />That nobody is wanting to do it LOL . and they always complain May did a bad job, well I guess the only option to save the people voice and dignity is to vote Liberal Democrats. atleast it stands for something they can explain. <br />A second referendum with 3 options.
Comment 224.2	Good. Both leavers and remainers are all full of shit. None of them had a clue 3 years ago, and still none of them have a clue now. If you voted leave with the expectation they can get any job or work done, let alone Brexit, you‚Äôre not on this planet. None of them could organise a shag in a brothel.
Comment 224.3	@Alain James<br /><br />Bullshit... the people voted to leave the EU. It&#39;s up to the politicians and bureaucrats, how exactly that happens. The remoaners are determined not to let it happen under ANY circumstances or ANY deal... they are the totalitarian ones, because they don&#39;t give a toss about the democratic vote of the people!! They should be kicked out of office, for being anti-democratic!
Comment 224.4	@Karl Marx The Bolshevik Rabbi democracy is a way to get the peope to believe that they matter more than they really do... sadly
Comment 224.5	POWER TO THE PEOPLE!  we needed 2d referendum !
Comment225	I believe you can trust neither of them.

Comment226	End brexit now... It&#39;s now or never.<br />Save the UK from a demographic change!!! Get brexit done.
Comment 226.1	their trying but corbynov is a spoiler a child who says no ,and thats all,
Comment 226.2	got a lolecense to say that
Comment227	What Boris want is trump want to  fallow the USA corruption,
Comment 227.1	look the earth is round elvis is dead grow up..
Comment228	Your just angry cause you know you will never be prime minister ever
Comment229	How amazing. Thanks so much for going to work on Saturday. You expose your true feelings. Brexit or remain, you are more concerned at losing your day off once in a very long time. What would you say if there was a real issue of national defence. 3 years it might take or would you actually pull together, Or call the EU Army in?
Comment230	They do my flippin head in with ther constant proliferation, talking like they actually care about our nation, yakkin utter bullshit whilst eating ther jellied eels, not giving a second thought to those who cannot afford meals, just cut the crap, write this down...coz it should well be noted, listen to the people for once and remember what was voted
Comment231	They just voted against the PM.
Comment 231.1	I&#39;m worried of that.  In a very different way.  If we are on the edge of a social and general emergency.  Then in this, we are and that&#39;s the disaster for the vulnerable community groups in Britain find themselves in - with the changes in the support benefit system at this time in co-incidence  of the Brexit matter.  It&#39;s not a shock that it holds a concern for me!  For it does. Better off if we had voted in favour of remaining in the European Union. The very least has to be a negotiated departing - thanks to ALL political parties in Britain.  We don&#39;t have that - but one almighty cock-up! I will not be thanking the Labour Party Leader for it. Quite the opposite!
Comment 231.2	stephen isom hahaha, funniest thing I have heard in a long time, Liebour government, please tell me another whopper
Comment 231.3	Shame he doesn&#39;t care.
Comment 231.4	@Drake Hound and labour behind them is a wardrobe full of mothballs ,
Comment 231.5	Cause the PM has to represent the government not act like a dictator, in a democractic elected society.<br />That you voted somebody who lied to you, yeah tough luck. but that is why their is still a cabinet to save you. behind that cabinet is also a higher cabinet that checks if it is constitutional or not. <br /><br />It is all written in the rules and law. if people want to read it.
Comment232	The best you can say about this mess is that is the same as the &quot;deal&quot; offered by May. Just reshuffled.<br />If it were to pass Parliament, it would only display the rampant sexism of that institution. May the woman, no. Boris the whatever... ok.<br />Put the &quot;deal&quot; before the people so that they can vote on it in a referendum.<br />If it wins, so be it. If it doesn&#39;t, stay in the EU and forget this stupidity.
Comment233	Who thinks Brexit is the plan to collapse the UK?<br /><br />The 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum was very close, 55% voted Scotland to remain in the UK and 45% voted Scotland to the leave the UK, a lot of people voted Scotland to stay in the UK due to the fact that it keeps them in the EU, if they had separated from the UK, they would have left EU also. Shortly after this referendum we started hearing about Brexit, they knew that after UK leaves EU, Scotland has nothing to lose and they will gain their independence and Wales and Northern Ireland would follow( Ireland reunited), that way the UK would collapse and that was their plan since that referendum, all that immigration l, taxes, deals, trade all that is just for the public, the bigger picture is to collapse the UK.
Comment 233.1	@Nachannachle GOD and the DEVIL. wel you asked. and  I said it.<br />But but we don¬¥t believe in those two. you already signed the contract without you even realising it.
Comment 233.2	@Smash A Commie English independence ?
Comment 233.3	Scottish Independence - good. Irish Independence - good. Catalan Independence- good. British Independence- bad

Comment 236.1	@stephen isom well said.
Comment 236.2	he and labour are spoilers nothing more and is why they have lost almost 6 million voters and are now 19 percent behind in the polls after today that will rise,,there not interested in any thing except ruining the tory party and us along with them,
Comment237	322 to 306 we are BREXIT!<br />Sad Corbyn can go home and dream some more crazy Marxists dreams!

Comment 238.1	Paul Catten it&#39;ll take over 50 years to create deals you turd
Comment239	Corbyn is betraying the people of this great country the MP on the labour party and liberal democrats are a disgrace  to everyone leave and remain  who voted this is not about who voted  but about the MP listening to the people of great Britain  if  brexit is stop this will be the biggest insult to everybody in the referendum who voted  and that is 34 million people&#39;s who voted so if you want your votes   to mean jack shit and worthless and meaningless then stop brexit lets have a election so the people can decide on the traitors who sit in parliament in the name of the peoples of this country and kick them out
Comment240	Put this Corbyn creature back in his box
Comment241	Someone needs to shut that weasel up.  They are behaving like a man getting divorced who doesn‚Äôt want to stop living with his wife. It‚Äôs like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è get a grip. What the fuck, find a new girlfriend stop pandering for the fat old cow your leaving behind. Britain üá¨üáß built democracy and gave it away.

Comment244	If they dont get this done, they might not be working at all!!!
Comment245	SUPPORT THE BREXIT PARTY...  These hooligans you are looking at here are traitors to the 17.4 million voters. They can not be trusted . The majority voted to leave  lock stock and two barrels. No deal  clean break Brexit is the only solution
Comment 245.1	Tony Benn, Dennis Skinner and other far left politicians ( plus lefty miner&#39;s leader Arthur Scargill AND Corbyn before he became leader ) all wanted OUT of the EU because they said it WAS UNDEMOCRATIC. WHY is this fact constantly omitted? BREXIT isn&#39;t a &#39;right-wing&#39;, &#39;little Englander&#39; thing, this goes beyond the phoney left-right paradigm. This is about DEMOCRACY and the EU is anything but democratic.
Comment246	I wonder if BBC will support the protest in UK just like they did it to HK.
Comment 246.1	stephen isom mate fuck the BBC we all know they are paedo covering left wing Marxist funding scum, this country‚Äôs mainstream media is a laughing stock atm
Comment 246.2	@joe hayes the bbc call leave voters that protest right wing .if one of them shouts at a policeman or an mp then their thugs ,,its how our bias media works ,,
Comment 246.3	stephen isom right wing thugs? Sorry? Are you ok
Comment 246.4	Probably not, we all know the BBC bias
Comment 246.5	NO.if its leave british they will call them right wing thugs ,if its remain voters they show pictures from the air and double the size of the crowed ,so no,,
Comment247	Corbyn is full of shit as usual, he says Boris can&#39;t be trusted, that&#39;s rich coming from the Biggest Liar in Politics, he keeps pumping out the same old bilge he&#39;s been doing for years, if he&#39;s that confident to win an election then go for it we can&#39;t wait to get rid of the worse labour leader in history, it&#39;s him who can&#39;t be trusted. No matter what deal Boris got it wouldn&#39;t be good enough for this crackpot, if the vote it down just leave and we&#39;ll take our chances with WTO rules.
Comment248	Tony Benn, Dennis Skinner and other far left politicians ( plus lefty miner&#39;s leader Arthur Scargill AND Corbyn before he became leader ) all wanted OUT of the EU because they said it WAS UNDEMOCRATIC.<br />WHY is this fact constantly omitted?<br />BREXIT isn&#39;t a &#39;right-wing&#39;, &#39;little Englander&#39; thing, this goes beyond the phoney left-right paradigm.<br />This is about DEMOCRACY and the EU is anything but democratic.
Comment 248.1	Corbyn&#39;s position has always been one of a eurosceptic, but so should any rational person&#39;s. That doesn&#39;t mean you have to crash out with no deal, and the chances of getting a Brexit that protects workers under this Tory government is exactly zero, which is why a sensible left-wing position at the moment is to remain and reform. Failing that, wait until we have a government that puts workers first and then talk about leaving the EU in an orderly fashion.
Comment 248.2	I&#39;m neither for or against Brexit but that I know!
Comment 248.3	@stephen isom yes it was ^_^
Comment 248.4	@Antony Cole no it was not .
Comment 248.5	Brexit was promoted by the media, because a new law by the EU is implemented to crackdown on offshore funds.
Comment249	How about corbyn comes up with a better idea to increase the number of jobs for people in the low paid skilled manufacturing industry across the poorer parts of the UK, I see many people on my rounds in Cornwall that are crying out for work but all thr factories here are full of agency workers and nobody can get employed. I&#39;ve known guys who have worked in industrial jobs all across the nation that can&#39;t get a simple interview let alone a job. Brexit might not fix it completely but at least worker&#39;s rights can be redrawn after we exit.
Comment250	I hope you get out, prove the EU wrong and thrive a healthy economy and the Netherlands follow your example. The EU is terrible and cost us northern western countries way to much. The money is been made by countries like The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and the UK. We should leave... it‚Äôs not like we where 3rd world countries before the EU was what it is today. Making us scared about what will happen if the UK leaves the EU is unfunded imo
Comment 250.1	we will one day soon ,
Comment 250.2	EU = fascist state.
Comment251	Middle class ponce march in Westmonster, arranged within days ( supposedly ), yet I always thought you had to arrange any protest with the police etc WEEKS in advance?<br />Has this whole thing been planned from day one?<br />The middle class home counties tosspots represent NO ONE but themselves and certainly not the ordinary working class majority in this country.<br />The people voted and that is that.<br />Anyone who tries to derail democracy can expect any future general election to be contested, protested and a re-vote demanded.<br />Are we civlised grown ups, or a bunch of cry baby kids?<br />I know what I can see with the blue EU flags in Westmonster and it isn&#39;t educated adults, that&#39;s for sure.
Comment 251.1	@Brian Wilkinson the tory party most of them want out the brexit party want out together they can do it alone no..time to stop doing corbyns job ,so leave the tory,s out of your argument to get us out ,after their fair game ,think ,
Comment 251.2	Bollicks middle class ponces are the ones in charge of Brexit ! Your crazy if you believe Alexander Boris de fiefel Johnson and Rees Mogg , (is who has already told his investors how Brexit proof their investment) give a toss about you . You are being used and you will be discarded ....
Comment 251.3	vote tory or brexit  and kick them were it hurts ,
Comment252	Boris. Trump.Steve Bannon.Nigel.Le Pen.<br />And all you stupid sheep who blame the failures in your lives to immigrants. <br />Fuck you Cambridge Analytica.<br />Those who were dumb enough to believe in pathetic lazy populism, apologise to you forefathers.<br />Apologies to the teachers in your school and tell them you learned nothing.<br />Britain you can still fix this if you can band together and flight this infection of the mind and soul.<br />Good luck
Comment253	I wouldn&#39;t give Corbyn a blank cheque either. He would just donate it to his terrorist chums.
Comment254	More time to debate the Queen&#39;s speech and less time to debate Brexit today, what&#39;s their hurry what do they want to stop early for?

Comment 254.2	cocktails ..and cobynov will be wanting his turnip soup with cretins on top.
Comment255	I know he is doing is job but it gets to a point that he is blocking the English public&#39;s wishes and this makes him un- British
Comment256	Remainers: What about the Northern Ireland border?<br />Boris and EU: We have negotiated a deal.<br />Remainers: What about workers rights and the &quot;environment&quot; <br /><br />The Queen needs to dissolve parliament so we can get rid of these buffoons.
Comment 256.1	well said shifting goal post thats corbyn,,
Comment257	Fuck off bbc your propoganda against Brexit has been a disgrace
Comment258	Shit ya gob JC you support terrorists,. You only mouth off when you can see a possibility of getting in to No. 10.  And your &#39;open borders&#39; crazy talk will take the UK down the shitter.  Please go and live in Iran and take the maths wizard, Dianne Abbott with you
Comment259	Trade estate is our main source of income to this country and others.<br />Why is it you mp&#39;s are targeting our areas hey....?<br />Selling of our lands &amp; so much illegal builds going up.<br />Slough council and reading have allot to answer for
Comment 259.1	@prague pete you have done that one already word for word maybe if you varied the wording you would not come across as a boring loser with no view point of your own ,unintelligent ,now spend time writing a perfect reply to prove your a know all ,
Comment 259.2	Are you a half wit or a moron? Learn English you twit.
Comment260	So I&#39;ve read through a good deal of the comments, and JC is REALLY out if touch with the majority of the country. I&#39;d he started to support a deal ages ago and began to talk about how he should shape a more liberal England after Brexit I think he would end up winning the next generation election. Instead he&#39;s secluded himself form the majority and only increases unrest with those who voted to remain.
Comment 260.1	@Mccormick 432 no he wont they hate each other that wont happen ,
Comment 260.2	He could win the liberal vote by supporting a Brexit which allows for other countries growth, such as a greater agriculture agreement with African nations.
Comment261	Democracy is failing, need strong man to make decisive action, not debating with empty words!!!
Comment 261.1	Tony Benn, Dennis Skinner and other far left politicians ( plus lefty miner&#39;s leader Arthur Scargill AND Corbyn before he became leader ) all wanted OUT of the EU because they said it WAS UNDEMOCRATIC. WHY is this fact constantly omitted? BREXIT isn&#39;t a &#39;right-wing&#39;, &#39;little Englander&#39; thing, this goes beyond the phoney left-right paradigm. This is about DEMOCRACY and the EU is anything but democratic.
Comment262	Why doesn&#39;t anyone calls PM on riding the red bus with printed lies on it that made many people vote to leave? I know that people had other reasons for voting, but they were a mouthful of the NHS and should be called out on it. <br />How many people from steel and car manufacturing were let off since the referendum? <br />And if Ireland has access to the market, so should be Scotland who also voted to stay. <br />In the previous video, he said the UK needs to heal - and yet up until now, he was saying that the UK was never better... Which one is it: wounded and needs healing, or is it doing great? -I don&#39;t see anything getting better. <br /><br />Also, they missed the opportunity to ask the rolling party if they&#39;re trying to avoid new EU law that would interfere with their offshore accounts.
Comment 262.1	The whole media stance for Brexit was pushed by the crack down of offshore accounts. The ones who depend on the EU subsidies the  most voted for Brexit (farmers), those who could survive fine with Brexit voted against. People slitting their own throats.
Comment 262.2	Stop reading the DANDY. Try the BEANO . Much more informative.
Comment263	It couldn&#39;t be clearer that Corbyn and a number of other MPs wouldn&#39;t accept any deal. They&#39;d call any deal a bad deal because they don&#39;t want to deliver a democratic vote&#39;s outcome. And we wouldn&#39;t have to listen to people shouting &quot;no bread bins&quot; anymore.
Comment264	How can anyone call  Corbyn  &quot;Honourable &quot;commie terrorist loving  dishonourable morelike
Comment265	Get out Bretix...why you waiting so much?? Stop talking bullshit. Get out now.<br /><br />üòéüòéüòé

Comment267	The  working class  can  kiss  my  ass  ,I&#39;ve  got the  leaders  job  at  last.  Corbyn&#39;s  anthem
Comment 267.1	Think it&#39;s the working class he&#39;s worried about in light of this deal.
Comment268	What is going on with you people!!who want to stay in the E.U. Your mental illness is gonna make everyone in the UK ill.

Comment270	So now there‚Äôs a deal and they still won‚Äôt play ball and listen to their people? Parliamentary system seems just as stupid as what we have in America.
Comment 270.1	@Stupid Humanity Deserves To Die The same dennis skinner who said yesterday that he&#39;s going to vote against the deal.. says it all. The deal is worse than theresa may&#39;s deal and allows a no deal brexit still.
Comment 270.2	no we still have the people that can string words together that mean something ,
Comment 270.3	The UK system is not a parliamentary system.<br />It is as stupid as its copy in the USA.<br />In a parliamentary system, parliament is the highest authority, sovereign and under its own agenda.
Comment 270.4	Tony Benn, Dennis Skinner and other far left politicians ( plus lefty miner&#39;s leader Arthur Scargill AND Corbyn before he became leader ) all wanted OUT of the EU because they said it WAS UNDEMOCRATIC.

Comment 271.1	oh the media sponges are dripping parrot juice again i see ,try and think for yourself ,,
Comment272	Even if the EU paid us a million trillion euros each year for being outside the EU, Corbyn would still cry about it and recommend its rejection
Comment 272.1	@nio england <br />Yes you can prosper outside the EU, maybe as well as you did inside.<br />But if you keep believing all the lies you were told, and continue your trust in the Murdoch Press, base your decisions on the opinion of some posh speaking gentlemen, you will face a hard time.<br />After being a playball in the hands of Nigel Farage, I&#39;d prefer some little strings to friends that limit my freedom of movement but also prevent a homerun.
Comment 272.2	@Simon Machin <br />The EU is far from perfect and needs changes.<br />The idiotic move from Brussel to Strassbourg and back every month is a good example. To change it takes support of all 28 members and parliament itself.<br />France isn&#39;t very likely to give in, so it won&#39;t change, at least not soon.<br />Rights and freedoms given to EU citizens are one of the best in the world, they cannot be taken away or changed unless all 28 members and EU parliament agree with it, that is very unlikely to happen. There will always be one nation or national parliament that doesn&#39;t agree.<br />Any move to the right or left in a member state will not effect on these rights and freedoms, not even if it happens in ten of even fifteen members.<br /><br /><br />Rights and freedoms of high quality can exist in every country, but can be lost when an election is won by a party that has reason to change them.<br />Poland nor Hungary, not even the UK can revoke the rights of its citizens, not even if a majority wants to. The struggle of the UK with the rights of NI citizens is an example. How easy would they have been revoked if the UK was the only one to decide?<br /><br /><br />Please do not tell me that it is very unlikely that an idiot would win the elections in... for example..., the USA. That one man could change policies and trade in the world. That a simple stupid decision would cost an ally its freedom and cause thousands of deaths. Those things will never happen.
Comment 272.3	@Dutch Man I gotta say you aint as dumb as some on here, you have some grasp at least. its true things wont be simple but there&#39;s no need for all the crying and whinging, if people are strong enough then we can prosper outside the EU
Comment 272.4	@Dutch Man you bullshitters are some of the craziest people walking.<br /><br />Please, please entertain me how exactly are we losing our rights and freedoms when we leave the EU.
Comment 272.5	Dutch Man yes but there are facts and the facts are leaving with no deal will destroy our supply potential and a deal whatever it is will cause division because it won‚Äôt satisfy anyone and will harm our output as well EVERY economic indicator says so
Comment273	Chat disabled on live debate on c4.  Imvho, perhaps parties need to cease the zeitgeist a bit more?  Think it would make life more exciting.  I feel that I may be able to more because I am on anti-depressants, for which I am grateful.  The latter are the fruit of capitalism, but still I advocate a more &#39;pyjama&#39; approach to economo-politics.  (I would like work for which I do not have to submit a CV or have an interview.)

Comment 285.1	"@motor head1 <br /><br /><br />I&#39;m Irish AND European. I see NO contradiction between the two. Our nationalism is typically NOT predicated on either opposition to Europe or on &#39;Johnny Foreigner&#39; immigrant type tropes as in the case of extreme nationalism in the UK. Our nationalism is  more typically anti-colonial, a  feeling of having been occupied by a powerful military force¬† and portrayed for centuries as untermenschen, <a href=""https://www.pinterest.ie/pin/454793262352611819/?nic=1%C2%A0"">https://www.pinterest.ie/pin/454793262352611819/?nic=1¬†</a> . Our nationalism is  also predicated on an awareness  of having been starving, sometimes reviled  immigrants ourselves for generations. Thus white ethnocentric-nationalism about the great unwashed doesn&#39;t tend to grow well here however¬† much organisations (typically British, but occasionally German pegida type) try to astroturf the &#39;they&#39;re coming for the white women&#39; nationalism. Irish people are typically ALL too aware that these same tropes were used against us for centuries. See books like &#39;apes &amp; angel; the Irish in Victorian caricature&#39; or &#39;how the Irish became white&#39;. So that&#39;s my stance on scapegoating.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†<br /><br />¬†As a previous poster stated, I would also distinguish CLEARLY between antisemitism on the one hand, something deplorable and stupid, and criticism of the state of Israel on the other‚ÄîEVERY state is fair game for criticism.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†<br />¬†If you feel a connection to both Ireland AND Israel, you might want to consider if the following causes you¬† cognitive dissonance:¬† Irish¬† nationalist communities in Northern Ireland sometimes fly Palestinian flags, and the loyalist ones Israeli flags. BOTH sides in NI see an analogy. Degrees of sophistication will vary, but I trust you see the point‚Äî plenty of Irish people north and south see a parallel between the evictions of Irish people by the British state, the portrayal of us as bloody thirsty fanatics, and the evictions of Palestinians by the Israeli one and their portrayal in similar terms."
Comment 285.2	@Miche√°l √ì Coisdealbha Labour party embraces antisemitism...I was there..<br />They welcome in neo nazi and plo types..<br />Not sure why...<br />My cousins were labour from London now left that party being Jews who worked masonry construction there.<br />Now came to NYC .<br />I am half Irish half Russian Jew and concerned violence will be reignited due to Northern Ireland hard border etc..<br />England seems to be split on this Brexit but I observe the rise of finding scape goats being immigrants Irish Polish Arabs and or Jews as usual .The lack of industry and good jobs in England underlie this . One can thank Margeret Thatcher outsourcing good jobs to India and Asia...<br />Germany and Austria anti immigrant creating once  again neo nazi types rising into power ..<br />This must be stopped...<br />The whole purpose of EU was to prevent future wars and hate.
Comment 285.3	@motor head1  St. Patrick was likely Welsh, and European Jewry have been scapegoats; both straightforward observations; what point you are you are drawing from either isn&#39;t.
Comment 285.4	@Miche√°l √ì Coisdealbha when things go bad blame &quot;the Jews&quot; as Europe always did ( except the Irish).
Comment 285.5	@motor head1 What&#39;s your point?
Comment286	The Corbynista&#39;s and their usual &#39;Trump/America are the evil empire and we&#39;d rather trade with Communist China&#39; spiel.  Can we agree it&#39;s time America and the UK cut the cords and each go their own way.  No trade, no military co-operation, no nothing.
Comment287	This deal is a no deal through the back door. Border down the Irish Sea. It must be rejected.
Comment 287.1	so..
Comment288	A trump deal would be to totally break clean without paying any fines or penalty .So Corben is exaggerating and misleading as always.
Comment 288.1	Labour showing their true colours,  wto.  No deal . And Donald trump giving Corbyn a good thumping.  Whoopee !
Comment 288.2	What ???
Comment289	I&#39;d like to take this moment to thank MPs for WORKING ON A SATURDAY. The personal sacrifices these people make for their country inspires awe.
Comment 289.1	@Wuotans Krieger You&#39;re not the sharpest tool are you?
Comment 289.2	Do you have hearing problems? Mr Corbyn courteously thanked the staff who work in Westminster for giving up their normal day off to enable the house to sit. Do you work 6 or 7 days a week?
Comment290	Comrade Corbyn, you are the only one desaster for UK, not the deal . Deal was accepted by all EU staff!
Comment 290.1	@RAGSTAluvsDA90z People voted overwhelmingly voted to LEAVE THE EU, NOT TO NITPICK DEALS.  The UK has to make an offer and be prepared to leave with no deal if the offer is not accepted.  Leaving with A DEAL OR NO DEAL IS HOW TO DEAL  with the EU.  The EU is well aware that the remainers are in control and would prefer that the UK remain in the EU.  The EU rules Europe with NO ACCOUNTABILITY, to the people of ANY COUNTRY.  That is not democracy.
Comment 290.2	EU accepted it because it is worse than May&#39;s deal
Comment 290.3	The remainers wil not accept ANY DEAL, NO MATTER WHAT THE EU OFFERS. When people voted to LEAVE THE EU, it was a VOTE TO LEAVE THE EU, not to keep nitpicking EU deal offers. The Parliamentarians pretend that the voters did not understand what they were voting for and that the voters are stupid.  As a former British MP said, the EU is a union of &quot;fading economies&quot; and  and that it a fascist union with no accountability to anyone. Germany gets a say in how the  the UK economy should be run without even firing a shot. Nazi Germany wasted money on a massive  military and lost. If only they had  come up with the idea of an European Union. The UK parliament thinks this a game of Deal or No Deal.
Comment 290.4	Of course it was accepted by the eu cause it‚Äôs a pish deal your moron. And i‚Äôm right wing

Comment 298.4	Spot on.
Comment 298.5	Exactly
Comment299	Fair enough JC, vote it down and you will guarantee NO DEAL, is that better?
Comment 299.1	Skodaman2 Also a country with politicians lied to the public about necessary changes and reforms not taking place, with an economy based co-optation, were it was more important who you knew instead of what your quality was. A totally poised society. A country that thought all changes were for others and it could keep the way it was for 50 years already. Till the rest of the world found out that is.........
Comment 299.2	Skodaman2 This is exactly why there is a Brexit in the first place. Nothing to add.
Comment 299.3	@Ed Du The poisonous climate is caused by the EU, the left and the globalists.  If you can&#39;t see the totalitarian destructive nature of the EU now you soon will.
Comment 299.4	@Ed Du I&#39;ve lived in Greece.  Both the left and right generally despise the EU.
Comment 299.5	John Regan Which as being working class yourself you really wouldn‚Äôt want to happen. Again this leaving is totally against your own interests. It will come at a price

Comment 300.2	@stephen isom <br /><br />Get back to me after you&#39;ve mastered your own language. <br /><br />Trying to read your trolling drivel is giving me a headache. <br /><br />It&#39;s not your fault you&#39;re thick, but you don&#39;t need to troll me on several threads just to flaunt what an uneducated arse you are.<br /><br />I get it, you&#39;re thick, go show someone else your ignorance.
Comment 300.3	@stephen isom <br /><br />Clever* <br /><br />Dipshit.

Comment 302.2	@stephen isom No, it has even less to offer!
Comment 302.3	@Alex F As I recall on both occasions it was the United Kingdom who declared war on Germany.
Comment 302.4	@Fake Content Most of us do!
Comment 302.5	@Madame Clark Strange then that my companies exports to the US have risen by over 200% but don&#39;t let that stop you telling your lies.......
Comment303	Why would you make a deal with an entity that was purposefully slowly eroding your sovereignty?!?!?!<br /><br />This fight is ridiculous. No deal IS the best deal. I would rather suffer the potential financial problems than work with people who do not respect you.
Comment304	Corbyn doesn&#39;t want s deal, he doesn&#39;t wasn&#39;t no deal, he doesn&#39;t want an election, what does he want?
Comment 304.1	@Arfur Fuxxakes leave are realist.... you are on the other hand nothing but a media sponge soaking up the dire trite they have fed for 3,5 years your socially conditioned a wet media sponge parroting their propaganda,dripping it all over just like they want ,
Comment 304.2	Labour will be around long after you&#39;ve gone.<br /><br />Try not to be such an extremist, it just makes you look more stupid.
Comment 304.3	TIME  hoping we will all forget what he has not done for britain and he thinks we the stupid will vote him in ,he will be gone soon labour will be toast,
Comment 304.4	@Kevin Harker <br /><br />You know you&#39;re being dishonest. <br /><br />If Corbyn is power crazy he&#39;s spent decades being a decent MP and not climbed over others to get to the top.<br /><br />All I ask is that you at least try to be honest, even though you then wouldn&#39;t have any hate to spew.
Comment 304.5	@Arfur Fuxxakes thank you for your articulate comments, I will certainly take this into consideration
Comment305	The BBC is pedalling the same propaganda it has always done on this subject. Watching the news feed now.....only pro remain comments being fed. The most bias and out of touch news channel known to man.
Comment 305.1	@MyLittleDashie 7 <br /><br />BBC is the State Broadcaster. <br /><br />It gives the establishment&#39;s line on everything. <br /><br />That&#39;s why it&#39;s always kissing royal arse, hardly a leftwing trait.
Comment 305.2	@Richard OShea Oh well if it&#39;s &quot;most definitely in favour of remaining&quot; then i guess I&#39;ll just take your word for that. Very convincing argument and I definitely haven&#39;t been told the exact opposite by people on the other side of the political landscape from you.
Comment 305.3	MyLittleDashie 7 the BBC is most definitely in favour of remaining in the EU - ‚ÄòDear Old Auntie‚Äô was a little shocked by the referendum result.
Comment 305.4	I find it infinitely hilarious how I hear constantly people on the right <b>and</b> the left talking about how biased the BBC is. Somehow I don&#39;t think it can be biased if both sides think that it is.
Comment 305.5	You see what you want to see.
Comment306	They act like no one ever works on a Saturday.
Comment 306.1	U pay there wages lmao

WTO is a deal of sorts and is the best one there is. And the peefect compromise. God what do&#39;s it take to get through to the mush brain mps /pms. Just leave.

Comment 310.5	@Dylan Edwards it is yes ,
Comment311	No to europe no to a custom union. . We leave WTO terms only .by eu
Comment 311.1	ian ball the only way  WTO
Comment312	Says the marxist traitor.
Comment313	Corbynov  speak with fork tongue. He talks shit. Real shit but the again they all do. We are not facing a climate emergency thats the biggest lie on the planet. Its not man made its nature. Look at the truth. The soler system is warming up. . is that down to man made polution. The human race is only having 0.8% impact and that is 100% fact and that is dropping down further.
Comment314	They want a good deal and also want to exit the union<br /><br />I want to drink nonstop but don&#39;t want the hangover
Comment 314.1	&#39;Boris &amp; Trump&#39;s Deadliest Trick, w Stephen Fry&#39; ~ the 11.40 yt video [by Pindex]
Comment315	Demonstrations broke out in Britain, but British police arrested and banned them. Strongly condemns the British police for depriving them of the right to free speech
Comment 315.1	@„Ç¢„Éû„Ç≠ The bbc is fully aware of what is happening in my country but they reason they report far more biasedly than their international news is because the current government of the uk (convervatives/tories) are a right wing government and appoint people in charge of the bbc who allign with their point of view and over the years they&#39;ve gotten to a point where they pretty much say what the government wants them to say on the most bad looking news/topics. They don&#39;t need such dramatic bias on international coverage because the government doesn&#39;t need the public to believe a certain thing with international news, hong kong is a democracy so it&#39;s something we promote however the conversatives have been hush to a degree in regards to china because china spends a huge deal of money in the UK which they like since they support privasitation and selling off assests to international companies however the public doesn&#39;t support this. The UKs main opposition is running on a nationlisation/socialist manifesto and promises some radical change to climate laws and social + health care and banking/media regulation. This is everything the conservatives despise and are going to suprising lengths to spin all sorts of news to fit them so the people trust them.
Comment 315.2	@RRJStudioo As you said. Some people use free speech as an excuse to spread bad things. This is the case in the UK, as is the case in Hong Kong. I&#39;ve always wondered why the BBC didn&#39;t care about what&#39;s happening in the country of its own, but  do a lot of programs about Hong Kong. People are always innocent. I have no prejudice against the British people. But I also feel that what happened in Hong Kong should not be treated differently as &quot;people yearning for democracy and being stopped by police violence&quot;. The police are only doing their part. This is the case with the British police. The same is true of the Hong Kong police.There are enough troubles in Britain. Intervene things around in other countries. It seems to me very unwise.
Comment 315.3	@„Ç¢„Éû„Ç≠ You have to realise that even though the UK is democratic there is a lot of money and power involved with a right wing governemnt currently with a media dominated by billionaires and right wing hate preachers, there are a lot of people who agree with freedom of speech and to protest but there are also issues now of people using free of speech to spread hate speech and the newspapers are against protesters so the police try to stop too much disobedience. The UK is just in weird postion rn,
Comment 315.4	@RRJStudioo I don&#39;t think I have anything wrong. Otherwise, why the riots and processions in Hong Kong are people&#39;s demands for democracy and freedom of speech? but happens in Britain is illegal and unprotected? You are too double standard. And I have my freedom of speech. Isn&#39;t that what you advocate and hope for?
Comment 315.5	@Andrew Wright You enjoy licking those state boots? you didn&#39;t invent the term crusties you just copied boris after he said it, pathetic establishment arse licker. You&#39;re so dumb that you&#39;ve been brainwashed, should be deported.
Comment316	It&#39;s time the UK stops wasting the EU&#39;s and the WORLDS time!<br />They can&#39;t agree on anything - so the best for the world is a hard Brexit, it&#39;s not good for the UK but the right wing and their deplorables in their low IQ extremism need to learn the idiocy of their propaganda!
Comment 316.1	While ever we&#39;re &quot;wasting&quot; the EU&#39;s time though we&#39;re still pouring billions into parasitical countries that take more then they contribute. We&#39;re still feeding, clothing and housing workshy parasites that are sitting pretty off of the Englishman. You know over here in the UK it&#39;s shameful taking handouts from your neighbours and expecting them to feed our kids. Other EU countries inhabitants both in their own countries and in ours seem to revel in it and wear their need to sponge off of other people like a badge of honour.
Comment317	The torys have wasted that much money on the beginning of Brexit to know .... I thought they had...
Comment 317.1	@Johnny Feve i am a leave voter the eu is a monster corrupt and dangerous we need to leave and break the chain they have around all europe we are going i wish you well.
Comment 317.2	@stephen isom OK sit back... Fist they created a EU objective of Austerity voted in by parliment 600billion given to Buiness benefits... Leaving tens of thousands Dead by legal Manslaughter.... Then embark on creating a back stop within a agreement to undermine any attempt to leave in reality just wasting uks money knowing the cost would run into billions within 3years of Deception.... To gain time for other EU agenda&#39;s approaching while the UK are blindsided by these tatics put into place.... Then you look a the deals put forward and the times they have been rejected... Then a by magic Boris... Rescues brexit by removing the back stop... Within weeks.. May couldn&#39;t do in years.. Wow.... But not only do UK loose 39 billion they give up part of a union.. And stay within the EU for years.... Like May.. This deal will return again and again... Its not only the EU that&#39;s can&#39;t except.. NO.. Tory are no better.. its not there money to waste with these private projects within the EU at the expense of the public.... There is a default deal that is within UK law... Stating UK leaves and trades with no change or difference for years... And it does not cost them a penny its within the conditions of article 50.... So question why is a government a parliament ignoring this Truth to deliberately waste taxpayer&#39;s money on trade deals that are not essential to trade or make any difference to the system for years..... Fact if UK had left  there would of been another government and Parliament in place..... To make tr√•d deal and move the United Kingdom forward... But fear and Deception shows the tretrouse system been used to suppress them....
Comment 317.3	@Johnny Feve where ,

Comment 318.1	Uk&#39;s people voted for Brexit.   And rightfully so. Wouldn&#39;t really say people are stupid,  but that they make choices of survival.
Comment 318.2	Paul Marsh I‚Äôm wearing nothing today.
Comment319	If this deal passes or the UK ends up with a no deal the BBC are going to reach epic hysteria levels.

Comment 319.3	Well yea, this socialist state run media BBC,  is comprised of the same communist style thinkers that make up the labour party.    They love the EU   in fact they would likely vote in favour of one world govt.
Comment 319.4	@Jim Goodwin <br /><br />You&#39;re a Trumpette. <br /><br />We laugh at you a lot.<br /><br />I never said you were an American, you dimly assumed so.<br /><br />How, expected.
Comment320	BBC - ARE YOU LISTENING TO THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE WESTMINSTER - BECAUSE IF YOU DON&#39;T - AGAIN - YOU HAVE FAILED T0 REPORT THE TRUTH. AND I WILL NOT PAY YOU FOR THE PRIVILEGE.
Comment 320.1	the majority outside are remainers.... :)
Comment 320.2	It&#39;s the voice of &#39;some&#39; people outside Westminster, not &#39;the&#39; people.
Comment 320.3	Watch the bloody TV channel if you want more stories from them. This story is only about what is happening in Parliament.
Comment321	Deal done badly <b>on purpose.</b><br />Either to get a no deal or to scupper the whole BREXIT full stop.<br />It better had not be the latter.....or else...
Comment 321.1	Or else what, you boomers and unemployed will grumble from your seat? lmao
Comment 321.2	Winged Messenger yh lol
Comment322	Boris pretending to be speaking on behalf of UK businesses!!? Ludicrous!  Stability yes, outcome of Brexit unknown as well as his fiscal policies following Brexit!
Comment323	All the left wants to do is take people&#39;s money and now he is worried about a blank check?  <br /><br />Hypocritical  ass
Comment324	Boris betrayed us like Tories always do, Labour betrayed us like commies always do.<br /><br />All of them are scum who don&#39;t care for democracy
Comment325	the torys are a bunch of lying buggers, they say they wanted to tackle global warming yet in this this agreement they want more of guidelines put in an not laws, they could say whatever they wanted but not have to stick to any of it :/
Comment 325.1	the germans have built 3 new coal fired power plants so do you only atack your own country like rim owners or are you just a miles short of all the facts ,pffft,
Comment 325.2	@Karezza Kenosis I&#39;ve sat down had a joint and a think an came to the conclusion you&#39;re a moron
Comment 325.3	@amy victoria I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.
Comment 325.4	@Karezza Kenosis ffs what mission is that then?
Comment 325.5	@amy victoria This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardise it.
Comment326	Brexit Party all the way to parliament for me.
Comment 326.1	A party with no policies apart from just Brexit!
Comment327	Its laughable how cor many hates America...why wouldn&#39;t we want a deal with the US...we are their strongest ally  and them ours...a deal with the EU and US would be brilliant
Comment 327.1	Are they? I&#39;d much prefer to drop the petrodollar so the world can follow suit and crush the USA economically. They are no ally to anyone
Comment328	It‚Äôs either this deal or no deal
Comment 328.1	@Ash G no the UK government agreed to accept them but we have no say in getting rid of them
Comment 328.2	@Geth Creator we already could pick and choose. It was the UK government imposing all the regulations you lot hate, not the eu
Comment 328.3	@Ash G most regulation that comes from the EU isn&#39;t to protect its to ensure we can&#39;t leave them in the dust economically
Comment 328.4	@Ash G regulation and standards are two different things. Regulation in this context is an umbrella for many things, it could be tax regulation, it could be food regulations. We can pick and choose once we are out of the EU
Comment 328.5	@Geth Creator regulation means workers and consumers rights. We will get terrible food and be forced to pay more for it. We will also get less money as a result. Honestly if you can&#39;t see that after all the impact assessments that have been released over the last three years you deserve what&#39;s coming.
Comment329	UK has the best deal being in the EU so why do people keep expecting to get a better deal after we leave the EU. Absolutely absurd.
Comment 329.1	@Meaow Meaow yes it also correct,
Comment 329.2	@stephen isom hmmm... is that your argument?
Comment 329.3	and all these wonderful things are ,,,,,,,er yeh well the MEDIA say so all the time so it must be true ,,derrrr,
Comment 329.4	@Sham Pain That&#39;s a really ignorant comment to make and simply displays that you lack basic intellectual ability to engage in a debate.
Comment 329.5	did you also support Hitlers version of Europe
Comment330	So Jeremy told Boris to negotiate before he leaves on October 31. So I guess if this deal ain&#39;t pass today Jeremy will have to agree with a general election .
Comment331	How does our population go from 66 million now to only 15 million in 2025?<br />@t<br />Similar figures are projected for other western nations.@t

Comment333	*Basically if the Parliament runs fairly, Now is the Time for the Parliament to give BORIS a Complete Trust to finish up to the Goal of a Deal Agreement things between the British and the ‚Ç¨U!
Comment334	Vote No on Brexit Deal! Boris Johnson is an Idiot!

Comment 337.5	@stephen isom on a serious note, I should sign up for meme wars. I would win them all hands down lol.
Comment338	Boris Johnson&#39;s bollocks deal
Comment 338.1	@Daryl Kemp ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ this is how bojo always speak. But have you hear the latest? Brexit has just been delayed ok. Let&#39;s see how your threat fits in.<br />But stop insulting people here, just because you want to pass your message across. <br />Brexit means Brexit according to you and bojo, but not a crooked Brexit put in place by bojo
Comment 338.2	Another leftie remoaner we voted to leave and leave  means L.E.A.V.E!!!!! Get it into your thick skulls we dont want Germany or france dictating our countrys future
Comment 338.3	@Kevin Harker really want to enjoy my xmas with no Brexit fever. Am tired of all this nonsense

Comment 338.5	No divisivec 2nd ref.<br />Take months to organize..<br />People&#39;s vote please.!<br />   Snap gen election December.<br />Want to enjoy a Brexit free Xmas!<br /><br /> And life.
Comment339	Would you want  a deceitful man like Corbyn with you when the chips are down  or the UK was under threat ?   He does not want a no deal divorce then he can&#39;t even agree when a deal is done ,the only thing he wants to ignore a democratic referendum and have no brexit at all !!
Comment340	Why do i feel that bungling boris is bending over to get an american trade deal more than anything else. His their money under the table. He dont care about the people. He wants a full pocket.and he wont be eating american food
Comment 340.1	BECAUSE YOU  listen to the bias media and shite on web sites thats why,,
Comment 340.2	Have you just plucked this diatribe out of your rear end?  Was Diane Abbott a schoolmate of yours?<br />Any chance that you might furnish a few hard facts to support your shotgun contentions?
Comment 340.3	Australia deal too UK is leaving that empty poor fish bowl . Australia and America have way more to offer the UK than Europe
Comment341	THERE ISN&#39;T A CLIMATE EMERGENCY! Theres no science backing it up and there&#39;s no evidence, it&#39;s just talk and activism. It&#39;s all lies and propaganda for a communist, undemocratic, satanic one world government. DON&#39;T FALL FOR THE LIES.
Comment 341.1	@Meaow Meaow The point being is that &quot;the climate&quot; is easy to understand, so I don&#39;t have to be an expert. I must not be making it clear enough for you, I might have to dumb things down to your level but I&#39;m afraid of heights.
Comment 341.2	‚Äã@Giving You The Facts Ministries LOL, &quot;I don&#39;t have to be an expert to understand the climate&quot; - Well that tells me all about the quality of your independent brain :D
Comment 341.3	@Meaow Meaow Your comment is hilarious. I don&#39;t have to be an expert to understand the climate, I just have to have common sense and a independent brain, which you clearly don&#39;t have. There is no connection or scientific evidence at all between the climate and us or freak weather. Stop being a sheep and think for yourself.
Comment 341.4	Yes, all we need to do is listen to experts like you until the planet is completely F*****D!
Comment342	Although Jeremy Corbyn is far to anti capitalist for me, and sometimes he has been blind to clear antisemitism, he is right  this deal is pretty much the same as Mays with a few exceptions which make it worse. But brexiteers who have been feed lies will swolloe anything boris and his goons say. I ask brexiteers this, Is it worth tanking your economy for a little bit more self governance? <br /> GB have a lot of power in EU and will never get better trade deals on there own. The myth that EU is heading to a republic is utter bullsshit, language barriers and many others things will make that almost impossible. <br /><br />Best regards / A swede who doesn&#39;t understand how easily leavers duped millions of people.
Comment 342.1	Idk any brexiteers except party shills who support this deal. I want to leave but not the deal isn&#39;t leaving at all and we don&#39;t sell out parts of our own union.<br /><br />Leave voters do not support this deal only party hacks do
Comment343	Johnson or Corbyn... Who would you leave your kids with?
Comment 343.1	@Jon908584 he merely you said? But different from someone deliberately doing it. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Comment 343.2	@DANNY BOY So it is not acceptable to inject a little passion into your message?<br /><br /><br />Corbyn isn&#39;t very good at what he does, he merely insults people&#39;s intelligence.
Comment 343.3	@SuperSmashyfication ask Dongvale that first used it bigot. I copied what he said, I know I have to use bring instead of brought. If I have to start bringing out all ur stupid non standard English language u have so far used. You will in fact close your eyes in shame. But I do not have that time to waste with myopic people.
Comment 343.4	@DANNY BOY I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.
Comment 343.5	@DANNY BOY &quot;you did not brought hate&quot;<br /><br /><br />What was that about &quot;poor English composition?&quot;

Comment 355.1	@Do Nothing the b b c is soon going to have to explain why its been bias against britain ,,
Comment 355.2	the major contention was the back stop agreement which PM BoJo has managed to find a way around it, Corbyn has now tactically changed the subject of debate to workers rights and environment which are not real, he has now pitched camp with Remainers, BREXIT must be cancelled by all means.  I here others complain of its cost being expensive, well that can never be compared to ¬£100b due by 1st November if BREXIT is delayed further than 31st October.

Comment359	Let be honest, the deal is thrash
Comment 359.1	because what its trash american for rubbish why is it ,
Comment 359.2	I doubt anyone will get a better deal so now it should be a straight choice deal or no deal but of course all the remoaner MPs that have been moaning about no deal don&#39;t want a deal either just a 100% remain.
Comment360	I think lots of midldle class people like to forget that the majority of them are also workers - perhaps high-skilled ones, but workers nonetheless. You are going to allow the &#39;Tories to run roughshod over your rights. Like annual paid holidays? Tough shit. Like paid sick leave? Tough shit. Like limits on your hourly and weekly workload? Tough shit. Welcome to post-EU &#39;Tory Britain. Unless you are a business owner, and a big business at that, there is nothing good that can come from the &#39;Tories pushing this crap through.
Comment361	This man and his party should have the whole of the UK behind him at this point in time, I believe after the next election they probably won&#39;t exist. and quite rightly so. The clowns in this party have forgotten that they should be representing the UK population, &quot;and they Don&#39;t&quot;

Comment 363.3	@Do Nothing he is an amerexican ignore him,,
Comment 363.4	"How to be Jeremy Corbyn<br /><br />1.  Shag Diane Abbott<br />2.  Support Irish and Islamic terrorism<br />3.  Hate the monarchy<br />4.  Defend atavistic Islam<br />5.  Be totally ignorant of economics<br />6.  Support unlimited immigration<br />7.  Want the NHS to be a worldwide health service<br />8.  Be totally ignorant of the consequences of his policies.<br />9.  Don&#39;t care if England becomes Islamic<br />10.  Want to give welfare to the entire planet.<br />11.  Prefer foreigners to English.<br />12.  Bring you mates to see Diane Abbott naked in bed."

Comment 367.1	Yeah, the ERG would&#39;ve voted for May&#39;s deal allll that time ago. They are the frustrators, the thwarters, the charlatans and promotion chasers. Well, they&#39;ve already got their promotions and pay rises.

Comment 368.1	he has no view only to say no no no no so what is it he has got right every one including the media would like to know so what is it ,,or are you just empty words on a screen ,um,
Comment 368.2	Corbyn. *
Comment 368.3	On what,?
Comment369	Well said Jeremy! <br /><br />We&#39;re all sick to death of Brexit, but that&#39;s no excuse to force through a bad deal just to get it over with. <br /><br />It&#39;s too important to be left to ideological extremists.
Comment 369.1	@stephen isom <br /><br />Have you asked a question? <br /><br />You don&#39;t use question marks so I really can&#39;t tell.<br /><br />All I can tell is that you&#39;re pointless. <br /><br />You just attack with pathetic attempts at insults. <br /><br />You&#39;re a pointless troll.<br /><br />If you have a point,  make it.<br /><br />If you&#39;re going to continue to be pointless, you&#39;re a waste of my and your parents time and effort.

Comment370	Let&#39;s face it,  labour,  just like the dem party in the US,  will take the opposite side whatever conservatives do. It&#39;s the way they roll.
Comment 370.1	@Jess√© Middleton „ÉÑ &quot;sexuality is a spectrum.&quot;<br /><br />name how many?
Comment 370.2	@Jess√© Middleton „ÉÑ That&#39;s complete rot. It&#39;s Deviance.
Comment 370.3	@Jess√© Middleton „ÉÑ Define gender.
Comment 370.4	@Pete C You clearly don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re talking about. There is a difference between genders and sexual orientation. Those are completely different thing. You&#39;re confusing yourself.  There are only 2 genders, but sexuality is a spectrum.
Comment 370.5	@Pete C <br /><br />So you think there are only two genders?<br /><br />There are only two sexes. <br /><br />Maybe you don&#39;t know the difference between sex and gender?
