Comment1	If the EU had really understood the perspicacity of Charles de Gaulle when he refused the UK&#39;s application for membership, non of this chaos would have happened.
Comment2	Yookaii  is in turmoiiiiil

Comment6	BBC reports have been reduced to babbling women. I thought this was the age of Equality? I can&#39;t understand BBC women reporter-speak and had to turn it off. The information content was close to zero. They talk a  lot but say nothing.
Comment7	Kate and guard, 1am .
Comment8	Why all these talk and meaningless talk.??? The British said they are leaving, so be it..After they leave ..then negotiations will continue period!!!
Comment9	Basically brexit has been a good sport for everyone - journalists and media companies, spectators, and politicians. The more drama, the more engagement, the better the figures. Poor average joneses, blue collar or white collar, these will pay for this extravaganza.
Comment10	Despite the hatred from the BBC for years, the Brexiteers stood strong. I am proud of them. The traitors from the BBC have lost credibility for ever.
Comment11	Anything‚Äôs better than the evil, dangerous and silly Labour party
Comment12	Hopefully deal can be done &amp; wrapped up so, we can get on with our lives, sick of it.
Comment13	A WITHDRAWAL  deal is but the end of the beginning!!!!!!!!
Comment 13.1	I am here
Comment14	Any &quot;deal&quot; featuring the likes of Macron and Merkel will be no deal at all for us Brits...
Comment15	If NI stays in the EU single market and CU Scotland will want the same. And maybe Wales too as recent polls show that Wales had changed its kind. Come to that, so has England.
Comment16	We should join EEA to cushion the blow and as such gain EU investment let alone trade because investment is merely greasing the right wheels. Brexit is a great opportunity for fair trade with Africa and South America to deal with emerging market and newly industrialised nations like Turkey too.
Comment17	Come on Australia! We wnat brexit on 19th october! Bloody Poms!
Comment18	And all those people kissing each others! What a bunch of pooftahs! We want to see blood!
Comment19	AS IF THERE IS NOT ENOUGH CHAOS IN THE WORLD WITHOUT BRINGING IT TO BRITAIN
Comment20	if the wurzels got in power they would change Brussels to Bruzzles.
Comment21	Listen......‚ÄùBrexit  Bojo Channel‚Äù....BBC..<br /><br /><br /><br />First ...An extension!!....Followed by an Election!!<br /><br />Followed by a NEW REFERENDUM!!!     .<br /><br />...In that order!!!   <br /><br />That‚Äôs the will of the people now !!!!<br /><br />STOP with the 17.million voters speech....People who voted to leave, 3 flipping years ago, voted on the basis that if we did leave..That it was going to be easy, painless, and that no harm would ever reach our economy and our working class people. <br /><br />Brexit started as a lie, and it will END as a lie !!!
Comment22	I&#39;m so sick of the EU, why on earth do some people stilk want us to remain as some vassal state to these people?
Comment 22.1	For some reason all your comrades are in queue to get an EU visa Michal Vasiljevich ü§£
Comment 22.2	they cant understand as you are leaving on sentiment. but its the sentiment of the defeated. of the old racist grannies or the people forever on benefits, or the 50 year old grizzly fascists. the proportion of uneducated trash is now larger than the proportion of decent minded people and the country will capsize over.
Comment 22.3	I&#39;ll tell you - 1/ Europe doesn&#39;t want other EU countries trying it on - leaving. 2/:Everybody associated in BREXIT talks with the EU can&#39;t understand why we want out.<br /><br />How do we know whether a bad deal is bad or just an excuse to remain?<br /><br />Why can&#39;t the UK just LEAVE!?<br /><br />The Queens speech said we were off and now look.<br /><br />Now there&#39;s more talk of an extention.
Comment 22.4	well, ive lived here for 6 years.
Comment23	There is a whole world to trade with and we are stuck with 27.
Comment 23.1	Imagine having trade deals with 120 countries, oh wait!? You do thanks to the EU. Btw, EU and US trade deals are ruled out by a hard border in Ireland, so that&#39;s more than half of the world&#39;s interesting GDP down the drain. Japan signed a competitive agreement with the EU, so the &#39;best deal&#39; is the one you&#39;ve got. You&#39;re deluded if you are just counting the number of countries in the world. Look at what the UK economy is good at and realise that what you offer is majority only of interest to advanced economies. Unless you think African, Latin American or South East Asian economies are looking for advanced financial services or high-end to luxury manufacturing. <br /><br />Go look at what the Director General of the WTO wrote recently, you might be surprised.

Comment25	Let Brexit hard landing,  and don&#39;t give them anything. Or next inline are Italy, Spain, Greece etc...<br />So much bs drama<br />Kick British out with nothing.
Comment 25.1	@bertie cunty deal
Comment 25.2	Yes  and kick you in the head
Comment26	I like the idea this is BJ‚Äôs ‚Äòlast ditch‚Äô effort. Is it the one he‚Äôs going to jump in and shoot him self?
Comment27	Voting for a deal is voting for No-deal, fools
Comment 27.1	your the fool.
Comment28	We are only in this position because of the REMAIN MPs and the REMAIN MSM, the PEOPLE are being IGNORED.
Comment 28.1	the sheeple you mean....arf  arf...
Comment29	The Irish border question is the perfect conundrum. It looks relatively simple to solve but in practice there is no solution apart from its present state.
Comment 29.1	But the dup don&#39;t want that so the saga goes on and on limping from one deal to another that they can&#39;t agree to because the british goverment who were stupid enourgh to have an election and lose an overall mojority had to compound their stupidity by going into coalition with them a mistake that every other party in the uk warned them agienst.
Comment 29.2	Or... britain takes all their unionists back and Ireland can be whole again.
Comment30	bbc go for brexit and don&#39;t stop everyone walking by
Comment31	It&#39;s not A DEAL...it&#39;s A Treatyyyy, we didn&#39;t vote to leave the EU and sign up to A Treatyyyy. Clean break then we can choose what deal we want, if EU agrees then great if not we can have deals with the rest of the world. Enough is enough, respect the will of the people.
Comment 31.1	&#39;The rest of the world&#39;= global economy - EU - US (hard border in Ireland kills any chance of a US deal due to the Irish lobby and the US having underwritten the GFA) - Japan (they signed a competitive deal with the EU) - any countries that would avoid pissing off half the worlds global wealth. Now think about what you export, it&#39;s basically only of interest to advanced economies. As I&#39;ve shown above, you have already excluded 29/35 advanced economies that you currently have favourable arrangements with (as members of the EU you enjoy deals with 120+ countries). You lose all of this overnight. <br /><br />But no, I&#39;m sure some rural workers in African or Latin-American economies are very excited by the prospect of buying tariff-affected luxury goods or advanced financial services in a language they don&#39;t understand. Get a f*cking grip.

Comment 38.1	I think if this deal is voted down  which it will be that asking for an extenchion which boris say&#39;s he&#39;s going to do now is a waste of time. More of the same shit i&#39;m irish but enourgh is enourgh time to shit or leave the pot

Comment43	"What they keep secret is the continued quantitative easing going on in The EU, which is basically watering down YOUR money so their debt is easier to <a href=""http://pay.it/"">pay.It</a> means every time you save money they devalue in more and more and every time you get a pay rise it‚Äôs not really a rise your just keeping pace.Meanwhile the EU and German banks use the money to pay themselves large bonuss.The media is in the pockets of these Globalists which is why nobody believes the fake news from the BBC and CNN."
Comment 43.1	And how would quantitative easing (injecting liquidity into the economy through the purchase of prespecified bonds or assets) water down your money? Apart from the fact that the EU is not doing it, exchange rates and general principles of supply and demand dictate that large scale quantitative easing by the EU (in Euros) would strengthen the Pound.
Comment44	Its irrelevant trying to get a deal, labour will not vote for any deal negotiated by the conservatives.
Comment45	I envy the English people here in the EU zone, where people have their minds clogged by the speeches of politicians like Macron and Merkel. Congrats, be out of the hands of globalists with no deal !
Comment46	the crucial stage being where absolutely everyone knows the best deal is no brexit.
Comment47	And nothing was lost or gained of value after three years of debate. what a pointless shitshow. No deal, Hard border, is the only way forward.
Comment 47.1	&quot;nothing was lost or gained of value after three years of debate. &quot; &lt; actually a lot of profit and business due to the mere threat of brexit has been lost and that before the deadline.<br />it is the biggest diplomatic and economic disaster in centuries and it is deliberate.<br />brexit threatens that special relationship with the USA and here is how... <br />the UK had the best deal in the world being on the fence between USA and EU with it&#39;s own currency one foot on each side, <br />being in one of the biggest trading blocks in the world, being USAmerica&#39;s influence IN the EU while also being the EU&#39;s influence on USAmerica. <br />Both diplomatically and economically the supremely superior position. <br />IF the UK leaves the EU then the UK will be less important to the USA. <br />THAT will make obtaining deals with USAmerica MORE difficult than easier. <br />So with brexit the UK becomes diplomatically and economically less important to both sides of that fence. <br /><br />brexit was funded to crash the pound so you can see where the asset strippers will be coming from.... <br />BOTH sides of that extremely profitable fence WE were sitting on.<br />brexit makes the UK the easy meat for the next asset stripping land grab for speculators and asset strippers from all over the world.
Comment 47.2	and the best deal no brexit.
Comment48	No deal is the best option for the UK at this stage
Comment 48.1	@Public Public Well I guess voters can decide what they want in a democracy...oh wait they already did
Comment 48.2	no brexit is the best deal at any stage.
Comment49	WHAT IS THIS BREXIT THING ‚ùì‚ùìü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
Comment50	I DON&#39;T WANT A DEAL, I WANT A CLEAN BREAK AND I AM FAR FROM BEING ALONE.
Comment 50.1	You want a kamikaze deal that leaves you naked and vulnerable and unable to close an agreement with EU countries, the US, Japan and any other nations that don&#39;t want to piss off those countries (the majority if they have to choose between you and 50% of global wealth). You want this, because either 1) you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about or 2) you&#39;ve got some nice options on the pound crashing. <br /><br />Your metaphorical &#39;clean break&#39; is declaring 99% of all contracts you signed in your personal life (mortgage, contract, insurance, etc.) void. You&#39;d lose your job, your house, your social and economic protections and you think this makes you stronger or puts you in a better position to renegotiate all of those? <br /><br />It&#39;s not too late, please read up on sources beyond tabloids, Brexit blogs and other trash. Look at what the WTO actually says about what the UK is doing. Surely you&#39;d be interested in that, given that that&#39;s what you think a &#39;clean break&#39; is?
Comment51	No one is leaving the EU. They&#39;ll drag it out until the sheep have had enough. Problem reaction solution. Everytime.
Comment52	No need. <br />Johnson has betrayed even his most ardent fans. &quot;Do or die&quot;. &quot;I&#39;d rather die in a ditch&quot;.<br /><br />Fine,  sign the extension letter then jump in. It&#39;s deep enough to take Mogg Farage and any other of these girls blouses!<br /><br />Plenty of room for a few run of the mill Bretards too. I&#39;m enjoying them realising they&#39;ve been screwed over and if I was the EU it&#39;d be a 10 year extension then rejection. Get some money back for the time BoZo has made them lose with his pathetic posing. <br /><br />I hope he,  Mogg and other fake Messiahs meet with the lynch mob of Bretards.<br /><br />It&#39;s going just as it was going to. No Bretards in the pub tonight thank god. <br /><br />I resent this scum benefetting at all from the UK&#39;s remaining. BoZo has no leverage,  the moron never did. But Bretards thought different.
Comment 52.1	Ffs he&#39;s a politician out for himself what tf do you expect their all the same
Comment 52.2	By FYI
Comment53	The ERG, DUP and Boris can all change their minds, but no the nation?.
Comment54	Stop bending over and dropping your pants DUDE, generations of Britain‚Äôs Soldiers lay‚Äôs dead in their fields, respect those who gave their lives to keep them free, tell them we leave come 31st October 2019, don‚Äôt stitch us UP DUDE or you‚Äôll be SORRY
Comment 54.1	Oh really? <br /><br />Talk is cheap. BoZo cares not for you or other Bretards he just wants the suit and chauffeur. <br /><br />He&#39;s screwed you. ......  Dude!
Comment55	Fuck a deal we don&#39;t want it. You will be on your knees before we are.
Comment 55.1	clueless
Comment56	That  geezer with a girls name, Michelle Barnier?... Is that the one who had a sly talk with that Remoaner Bercow. And you really want to deal with people like that?.. Nah, i&#39;ll take NO DEAL.<br />Also what&#39;s wrong with the Irish politicians. Can&#39;t they see the EU are only using them to make Brexit awkward as hell. The EU couldn&#39;t give a damn toss about Ireland<br />There will be no deal from the EU, they just want to ruin Brexit
Comment 56.1	Too late. <br />You lost. Get over it. <br /><br />BoZo just wants to be PM. He doesn&#39;t give a shit.  He&#39;ll sign the extension letter or it goes anyway. <br /><br />You&#39;ve been stupid and screwed.
Comment57	Thinking there will be a push for a second referendum with British Passport holders abroad allowed to vote as well so the result reflects the true will of most of the British people. The last referendum was very unfair on the Brits it really mattered most to.
Comment 57.1	@Albert Pike Nope cross boarder issues should have votes for the people in those areas.
Comment 57.2	@Albert Pike Britan is not an homogenous country like Japan.  We got roads from the Romans.  We have benefited from a diverse gene pool. <br /><br /><br />Look at Boris , he is more viking than Anglo Saxon. Farage -  think that is a french name. According to your logic then Boris and Farage should resign as they are not gene natives. Wished they would though because in this case they are not the best Europe has to offer.
Comment 57.3	British natives only in future referendums.
Comment58	It&#39;s all a scam they only want our money. Vote Brexit party when the time comes.
Comment59	The EU will never agree they need to keep us in for them to survive we need to walk away no deal
Comment60	WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE VOTED FOR!.JUST STOP PAYING THESE BLOODSUCKERS.ITS OUR TAXES BEING USED FOR THEM TO LUNCH WITH FINE WINES AN DO NOTHING BUT TAKE.THEY TREAT YOU LIKE SERFS..BROTHERS AND SISTERS ACROSS EUROPE JOIN US.TEAR DOWN THE EU AND WE ALL LIVE BETTER LIVES........JUST LAY THE LAW DOWN NO MORE MONEY......NO BENNDOVER DEAL .........NO SURRENDER DEAL...BRITAIN IS POWERFUL.<br />90 ODD GERMAN MEPS ,70 ODD UK MEPS..GERMAN BANKS RULE EU........T H I S   E  N D S  N O W!.
Comment61	Hey are these the talks an negosations that labour the iiberals notice i didnt put democrates an snp even the eu well they would say that wouldnt they an the opposition swollowed hook line an sinker were a fantasy
Comment 61.1	@Nicholas Woolfenden hey dont knock it loads of lads fought in the trenches for you to voice an opion an the freedom to express yourself didnt know what a commer or a full stop was spelling is down to a dody thumb lol
Comment 61.2	No grammar. No spelling.  What?
Comment62	That&#39;s a hell of a lot of crucial stages in 3 years!.
Comment63	Let&#39;s stop this brexit suicide... have a second referendum... we only lose from Brexit. They lied to us.
Comment 63.1	Britain is for the British, Adolf.
Comment 63.2	Said the lying ILL-liberal regressive remoaner.  Many of you remoaners are bureaucratic parasites who benefit from professional liars and thieves of the ruling  class parasites and other EU quangocrats.  Shameless are you seeking to benefit from corrupt ruling class parasitism.
Comment64	3 years of smoke &amp; mirrors has allowed media &amp; Govmnts to cover-up political scandals that need to be brought to Justice, like UK child grooming gangs (WESTMONSTER)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />FREE ASSANGE
Comment 64.1	Don;t forget the EU pedophile rings.
Comment65	Not if its that Damn Surrender Treaty wrapped in another cover!....
Comment66	Once everyone gets their bungs fairly distributed the public will be duped into thinking Britain will leave, but in actuality, our armed forces will be under the control of the gravy train that is Brussels.
Comment 66.1	Have faith in Britain. You‚Äôre probably right. It‚Äôs taken them 100 years. I suspect they will have some control, but they have ceded their military, along with France, to the EU, and all the other states are doing the same. Who starts the next war will more than likely be the bankers.
Comment 66.2	You mean Germany
Comment67	When the next economic crash comes, even the remainers will be thankful for Brexit, so the UK will be able to combat the crash with control over its own currency and interest rates. Without Brexit, everything will be at the mercy of the ECB..
Comment68	Boris gives way to the EU. Even May&#39;s deal was stronger than this. The House of commons will not accept a deal that has a border in the Irish Sea.
Comment 68.1	"Politico shows how the new voting cuts out half of those that voted leave, please pass this on, its urgent<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYhwy18zJc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYhwy18zJc</a>"
Comment 68.2	If Boris betrays Brexit with a new EU treaty, he has betrayed democracy for EU parasites, wasting UK spoils of tax extortion.
Comment69	HE IS GETTING WELL PAID
Comment 69.1	So would you if you were getting a billion a month from us dumb taxpayers squandered by an incompetent parliament of remaintards.
Comment 69.2	Yes, Barnier is. Partly from our pockets.
Comment70	Can we just get out without a deal already, the EU will never give us a good deal
Comment 70.1	"@Axel Nielsen You&#39;re right, I am guilty of having an absolutely negative perspective on all forms of parasitism, including this EU one resulting from bureaucratic centralization to increase yet more bloated, inefficient bureaucratic parasitism raising the cost of living on private sector people not living as parasites. Prominent Brexit leaders Daniel Hannan&#39;s and Nigel Farage&#39;s statements are independently fact checked as irrefutably true. The eloquent Daniel Hannan in this debate video, for example, eloquently exposes inane prattle of remoaners: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJcuKfcxo9w"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJcuKfcxo9w</a>"
Comment 70.2	You seems to be a very unhappy and negative person. I feel sorry for you. The only knowledge you seems to have about EU is from Farage and the media. However, get back to me after Boris has asked for another extension from EU which I almost hope they will reject so UK can have a new referendum or a general election. Johnson will then get a kick in the but and there will be NO more majority for leaving the EU! If this happen I am sure that persons like you will be a part of the &quot;Parliament of the Street&quot; when demonstrating.
Comment 70.3	@Axel Nielsen  Who other than remoaners without benefits are the real lunatics pushing for greater and greater levels of quangocratic and ruling class power to prosper from PARASITISM raising the cost of living for the UK people with real jobs?  It is fair to suspect you are either a brainwashed fearmonger or one whose political position stands to benefit as a parasite from increases from EU bureaucrat parasitism/centralization.
Comment 70.4	I acknowledge your position but please allow me to call it a bunch of BULL****. It is obvious that the only knowledge you have about EU is from the lunatic Nigel Farage. Did you say brainwashed?
Comment 70.5	@Axel Nielsen Your untenable position as quangocrat facilitating EU bureacrat parasitism in particular with the failing EU project of centralization says it all. Increasing waste, fraud and abuse against those with real jobs in UK is something only brainwashed remoaners and parasites benefiting will agree on.   Nigel Farage is correct, EU bureaucratic parasitism must be defeated to ensure UK independence, competitiveness and prosperity.
Comment71	Out now
Comment72	Let‚Äôs have a look at the deal and we‚Äôll tell you if we want it.
Comment 72.1	@R It&#39;ll be too late then. Didn&#39;t Rees-Mogg promise us a second referendum of the deal. Oh hang-on, that a politicians promise, that doesn&#39;t count.
Comment 72.2	@REMF the dup won&#39;t agree to that. Nice to see they&#39;ve moved on though, instead of just holding the rest of  ireland and britian to ransem their holding the whole of europe to ransem.
Comment 72.3	....yeh but thats not European.<br /><br /><br />BTW  Please Boris no effing extention.<br /><br />Surely just stick a border around the outside of Eire and Northern Ireland. Job done -
Comment 72.4	Its the same old deal, a trick, Voting for a deal is voting for No-deal
Comment 72.5	White Roses If Boris has sold us out and this is Theresa May‚Äôs deal and we are trapped in a terrible treaty with the EU, the Conservative party will get destroyed in the next election and will forever be remembered as the party of traitors.
Comment73	Just expel those guys already. As an EU citizen I am sick of wasting time with this Brexshit! Just let them go away and impose several embargos to them afterwards. We don‚Äôt need allies which betray us like they did. Goodbye UK and good luck! EU should start funding independence movements in Scotland and guarantee them a place in the EU. UK might learn they themselves might be an Union no one is happy about
Comment 73.1	Tabloids readers and their fantasies....From brexit to exocet missiles! lol! <br /> By the way, France exported only  5 missiles to Argentina and then stopped because of the Falkland crisis.
Comment 73.2	Paul Drive lol you make me laugh. I love British humor. But mate you should have learned from actual History books, not phantasy land books. The Russians were the ones who actually saved Europe from Nazifascism. You guys were mere secondary players bombing cities after the war was pretty much done like cowards.
Comment 73.3	Not like the French sold Exocet missiles to their Allies enemies in 1982 even though they were politely asked not to till after the conflict was over?. Oh and btw Embargoes work both ways likes tariffs do so bring it on! Euroland will lose more either way! and Bon Chance! Your going to need it!
Comment 73.4	Yeah not like we the British saved most/all of Europe from German occupation Twice! and talking of Betrayals if your a French EU citizen when our PM asked your government not to sell Exocet missiles to the Argentinians why did your government go ahead and do it anyway? Costing us ships and peoples lives!. Selling arms to your Allies enemies is called what in your version of euroland?....Btw Embargoes work both ways.....
Comment74	At this stage do any of us actually care? Personally I feel betrayed. Betrayed on Brexit, betrayed on Scottish Independence, betrayed in Northern Irish politics. Essentially politicians seem to be incapable of actually being satisfied with the will of the people and carrying it out. Politicians seem to have taken a big left swing from the centre. Sadly everything lives in equilibrium and I fear it will take a big swing to the right before we get back to the liberal centre, where we belong.
Comment 74.1	@Patrick Lucey god help britian if thats the case no laws will ever get passed
Comment 74.2	@Johnny Caruthers ireland and britian aren&#39;t that different after all if you say anything in ireland that doesn&#39;t agree with the status coe you&#39;re practally accused of been a reincarnation of adolf hitler
Comment 74.3	I will not go into details on my occupation but to say I am not smart enough to have an opinion seems rather ridiculous. Mind you it does detail what remain types believe. Those who disagree with them are not entitled to an opinion. It‚Äôs thanks to characters such as yourselves that liberal ideas are being shot down and giving rise to the right. As far as betrayal goes Nicola Sturgeon said that the last indyref was a once in a generation vote, she lied, I feel betrayed. The referendum question was whether we wanted to leave the EU, we voted leave and a number of politicians are actively trying to stop that, so I feel betrayed. Hardly seems that my opinions are wrong given what I have just stated are facts.
Comment 74.4	Patrick Lucey referendums are a bad idea and that is why Brexit is a bad idea.
Comment 74.5	@0IIIIII As someone said, &#39; take the &#39;do not drink&#39; off bleach bottles for two years and have a referendum. It will be remain.
Comment75	"THE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE ABOUT TO BE BETRAYED the new deal is merely a revival of Theresa May&#39;s deal.<br />NO DEAL or the Tori party is finished..."

Comment78	Doesn&#39;t Paris look lovely! and Ireland&#39;s planning ahead for 2040!!! The EU&#39;s a great place.
Comment 78.1	@Paul Drive Yeah that just about sums up Boris and Brexit. Pig in a frock haha ;-)
Comment 78.2	Europe will be Islamic by 2050 according to demographics.
Comment 78.3	Theres a saying: you can put a dress on a pig its still a pig in a dress!

Comment81	Of course we have the Benn act, aka, the bum boys act, put in place by the bum boys as they want instant access to their EU toy boys.

Comment 85.1	If your always writing in Caps may I suggest - should have gone to Specsavers!....
Comment86	Switzerland has open borders and is surrounded by Germany Italy France an Austria!
Comment 86.1	Switzerland has internationally declared Neutrality status thats the difference!
Comment 86.2	It also doesn&#39;t have open borders. You need to prepare paperwork and submit to inspections if you want to bring cargo across, and I believe it closes on the weekend.
Comment 86.3	Switzerland ist more bound to EU regularities than actual EU members and have no say at all!!
Comment 86.4	They allow freedom of moment. The Torys don&#39;t want that. They don&#39;t want British peop6to be able to live in the EU
Comment87	Always get the truth from the BBC.whatever they say I believe the opposite.
Comment88	The fighting Irish.. haha

Comment 88.4	&#39;The fighting Irish&#39; lost their country to the EU bankers.
Comment89	Hahaha another deal rushed though the parliament. Bet it&#39;s a bad deal that will give away our freedoms. Can see the lies in there. Eyes . No deal just leave
Comment 89.1	You&#39;re about 12 hours behind. Nobody&#39;s going anywhere least of all the UK. <br />Jump in bozo&#39;s ditch with him moron.
Comment90	"Resouvoir Dogs @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HORzqFN_aUw&amp;t=2m43s"">2:43</a> !"
Comment91	Let&#39;s get a deal and bring this to an end.
Comment 91.1	@John farrell do they care.  I care. The only way my pension will rise is when the banks have confidence in the economy.  Too much infighting. Get a deal and get out.
Comment 91.2	@Gordon Pattison were been hearing all  that since we voted leave ad rather b free than worry about the economy if it affects our economy its sure to affect there&#39;s
Comment 91.3	@Nicholas Woolfenden there all  wasting time  a no deal is the best opinion then do deals as equals
Comment 91.4	No. <br />BoZo has wasted EU time and money. 10 year extension will work.
Comment 91.5	@John farrell the economy will crash if we leave without a deal. If only for a few years. Depends on how old you are. My overseas pension has dropped 20percentage since the vote alone. The banks want certainty. I&#39;m fed up with all of this. Get a deal and get out and put an end to it
Comment92	Bet they wont get us put of NATO.
Comment 92.1	We created NATO....
Comment93	We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, ...
Comment 93.1	@Dennis Hill did you fight in it. No. No you didn&#39;t so shut the fuck up
Comment 93.2	@mrwideboy What as time got to do with it so that was all for nothing MRsmallboy
Comment 93.3	Just to let you know that was 80 years ago
Comment 93.4	Is this sarcastic? <br />You made me laugh üòÇ
Comment94	There will be a huge mistake to give brits a deal! Brits voted to leave and we in eu should show them the door! No deal! With deal mean british interference arent we Europeans have not learned that britan does not have place in our wonderfull union?? Give them no deal will be the right move! Eu will be much better with out uk! We will have clear vision of the future wich was never possible with brits in! Eu is about sharing brits cant understand that cause they want to rule! Therefore I strongly believe that the deal will be a huge mistake! Kick them out!!
Comment 94.1	@Shahist Filozof I&#39;m not talking about Brexit, I&#39;m talking about democracy as a political system, it doesn&#39;t work unless it is practiced in an ethnically homogenous civilization. The overwhelming majority of people are ethnocentric. Take London out (45% White British) for instance and Britain leaves by a landslide. But it doesn&#39;t matter anyway because we don&#39;t have democracy, we have parliamentary democracy,  which means they will do as they please, which is why they won&#39;t give us a general election, because the conservatives will win, based on people voting for Brexit. Get it?
Comment 94.2	@Ian Holloway I agree but thats how it is however I think brits did vote based in democratic system and of corse the magority  had no clue what the vote was or still is! But we in eu will honor uk desicion ! Meaning u voted to.leave there is the door! Asta la vista!
Comment 94.3	@Shahist Filozof Democracy is mob rule, the largest collective will always prevail. That&#39;s why it only works in a homogenous civilization.
Comment 94.4	"@andrew30 look at this ethnicity map, can you see how different races self segregated? That&#39;s because they prefer their own people, like me.<br /><a href=""http://projects.andrewwhitby.com/uk-ethnicity-map/"">http://projects.andrewwhitby.com/uk-ethnicity-map/</a>"
Comment 94.5	@andrew30 Most leavers are left leaning. London has high immigration concentration, so you prove my point.
Comment95	The bbc arse lickers are hoping there is a deal sorry to burst your propaganda bubble.<br />We are out with a no deal.
Comment 95.1	who even triggered these brexit?
Comment 95.2	Really? <br />Since when because the extension letter is ready to go. And he&#39;ll sign it because remaining PM is all he cares about. Not you or anyone else. <br /><br />You have shit on your faces.
Comment 95.3	You are a moron with shit for brains.

Comment 97.2	Bucket with a face on it brexit means brexitü§£üòÇ a cake and eat it deal, a norway deal
Comment 97.3	Rolf Brenner voted to stay in the U.K. for access to the EU...all bets off now indiref2
Comment 97.4	Bucket with a face on it....trying to stop the U.K. leaving an international peace treaty lodged with the UN that stopped a civil war
Comment 97.5	They had their chance they voted to stay in the U.K.
Comment98	Brexiteers will vote for this deal as they&#39;re scared of another referendum (&#39;the will of the people&#39;) which would come back remain.
Comment 98.1	@Anonymous I&#39;m beyond caring what the radicalised leavers want. Every single government impact assessment shows that there will be anything from a significant to catastrophic impact on the UK economy, what would any country impart such devastation upon itself in peacetime?¬†<br />Still, blue passports eh?
Comment 98.2	@Keith Nield<br />No, you just dont get it do you?<br />It doesn&#39;t matter if its before or after the 31st, we are going to absolutely reckon you cowards at the next election!<br /><br />Delying us leaving won&#39;t save you, it will just ignite and infuriate the leavers. You claim your now the will of the people, but you are officially avoiding a GE because you know your polling to lose xD<br /><br />The Remain campaign is one of failure, followed by denial and ending with cowardice betrayal. Your a sad cause on the wrong side of history, clinging on to the EU project. Most Remainers I know just want us to leave and move on now.
Comment 98.3	@Anonymous I&#39;d have thought you&#39;d be used to it by now. This doesn&#39;t end with Johnson getting his &#39;worse than May&#39;s&#39; deal through parliament.
Comment 98.4	@Keith Nield<br />Are you still going to blabber on about staying in EU once Boris destroyes Corbyn and Swinson next month?
Comment99	2030 the talk is ongoing a deal is possible, ohh May god when this brexit will be sorted.
Comment 99.1	Keith Nield the first country in the world to vote for sanctions to be put on themselves, couldn‚Äôt make it up.
Comment 99.2	‚Äã@andrew30 About two years ago a senior Dutch politician remarked that no country has ever inflicted so much damage upon itself during peacetime than Britain and Brexit. And remember - the Netherlands are one of the very few countries on this planet who actually proudly proclaim themselves to be our friends.
Comment 99.3	"Britons now wants to stay!<br /><a href=""https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-news-latest-britain-against-leaving-eu-as-poll-of-polls-says-most-now-want-to-stay-a4257476.html"">https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-news-latest-britain-against-leaving-eu-as-poll-of-polls-says-most-now-want-to-stay-a4257476.html</a>"
Comment 99.4	Keith Nield I‚Äôve seen a some foreign news channels talking about a brexit bonus for various cities, Brexiteers now talk of brexit like something to be survived like WW2
Comment 99.5	@TheMarker2015 L.S Did you read that in the Express and Mail?
Comment100	By Boris Johnson doing all that stupid Do or Die talk...the EU has more power than ever.  HE is the one who needs a deal by tomorrow, not the EU.   Hilarious.
Comment 100.1	@mgc7199 ü§£üòÇ
Comment 100.2	I hope they get him an excavator and ask where he&#39;d like the ditch.
Comment101	Boris punked everyone. He&#39;s gonna rewrite some of Theresa May&#39;s deal and do what he&#39;s best at... marketing the lie the he &quot;renegotiated&quot; it.  Just like Trump and NAFTA... the similarities are uncanny.
Comment102	I say Great Britain should join the United States as the  51st State.... your taxes will go down BIG TIME.
Comment 102.1	@twitty camies Hey, England, you can keep your Queen, but if you became the 51st State, you would have 2 US Senate members, and I would guess your MPs would become US congressmen. I&#39;m sure we could put E.R. on the $20.
Comment 102.2	I am here to help you in my father&#39;s path I am the lighr
Comment 102.3	Yes but as  Britain will now be the largest and wealthiest state in the union you will have to accept the crown back. This will be done by Donald J Trump bending the knee to her majesty Queen Elizabeth II in a formal ceremony of apology for 1777 act of rebellion. This can take place on the deck of USS Missouri (now renamed HMS Missouri of course).
Comment 102.4	I say anyone who wants to join the US is a threat to world peace.
Comment103	UK should change its name in Brexitania. And BBC should be called Brexit TV.
Comment104	From an Irish citizen  - simply this deal that will appear in the next 12 hrs will be reworded slightly but all in all it will be a Teresa may deal.... I find it very difficult to listen to peoples opinions on this as Ireland is getting blamed for this situation and we are not respecting what Britain want. People are forgetting this is in other words a divorce. I dont think any divorcee who writes down what they want in the divorce they get there is give and take and the Good Friday Agreement is not something to be disrespected. Our politicians worked hard together to end the troubles i dont want that to be thrown out. Respect our History. The biggest mistake made in this whole Brexit conundrum was Teresa may going into coalition with the DUP.  I hope people understand why Ireland and the EU will not allow a border between northern Ireland. <br />In my opinion what ever deal Boris comes up with tomorrow. I would put that to the people. It would be a referendum. The vote would be the deal or remain and the peoples decision stands. I can see the vote delay till the 31st January 2020
Comment 104.1	@Eilis Mcgee <br /><br />If that&#39;s the case, then why is the EU&#39;s boss, Angela Merkel, scared shitless of a clean break? She&#39;s already said the UK would be more competitive. And a customs border doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s going to be a 20ft wall with armed guards 24/7. Honestly, the way the media manage to sensationalism this stuff to the easily brainwashed is astonishing.
Comment 104.2	@Johnny Caruthers clean break will see business leave britain but if thats what you want.  Also yes there is a border but not a customs border big difference!!! And yes turn off the news and read up on the good friday agreement.
Comment 104.3	@Eilis Mcgee <br /><br />It&#39;s not &quot;crashing out&quot; - that is just a term conjured up by the media to scare the sheep. It&#39;s called a <b>clean break</b> . And there&#39;s already a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Word of advice: switch off the news, it&#39;s nothing but fearmongering.
Comment 104.4	@Johnny Caruthers well your not allowed crash out since its being put into law that no deal is allowed and I presume u dont want a border between north and republic ireland. Do you honestly think you could leave on british terms. Businesses in the uk need to be protected too
Comment 104.5	So basically you&#39;d want a referendum where the options are &#39;remain&#39; or &#39;remain&#39;.
Comment105	Brexit is something you keeping hearing so much you find yourself liking him.
Comment106	Just heard,<br />Boris to give it one last big push . If no movement. He has been advised to drink a bottle of Syrup of figs. That will get it past.
Comment 106.1	Still won&#39;t shift the dup
Comment 106.2	Pmsl. üëèüèøüëèüèæüëèüèΩüëèüèºüëèüèªüëè
Comment 106.3	its the bay of figs incident....
Comment 106.4	steady dude i haven&#39;t even had breakfast yet
Comment 106.5	That would be an even bigger mess !!!
Comment107	You yanks are a laughing stock
Comment108	Stephen Barclay you‚Äôre not George Clooney
Comment109	definitely a maybe really encapsulates the whole brexit process
Comment110	A rehash of mays surrender deal .. Tell em to get stuffed no deal ..
Comment 110.1	Yeah that really worked. <br /><br />You&#39;ve been fucked over by BoZo. My condolences (not).
Comment111	ireland  wants a vote to leave  the eu    the eu will collapse when uk leave
Comment112	Theyre trying to get it extended in my view
Comment 112.1	It will be extended. ....on &amp; on it goes.
Comment 112.2	They can try...Depends on whether our PM has the courage to carry out his convictions....?
Comment 112.3	They are. They&#39;ve already said they want two months extension to &quot;IRON OUT the details&quot;.
Comment113	The EU and the UK are like a group of schoolchildren who were set a group assignment but procrastinate and leave it to the final and minute. This is why if they do manage to agree on a deal it will certainly not be utilised to its fullest potential and may even turn out to be harmful for both the EU and the UK
Comment 113.1	@mgc7199 I think you need to spend less time on conspiracy theory sites. Why don&#39;t you try yoga? BTW the argument to remain was defeated in the referendum, you&#39;re in a fight where the opponent and crowd have gone home üòÇ
Comment 113.2	@Joe Bloggs. Words like regaining sovereignty while actually becomming a vassal state of America and friends? Get lost!
Comment 113.3	@Joe Bloggs. The argument to remain is that we need a cohesive powerblock to oppose the petrodollar coalition waging illegal wars of aggression supported by our demand for petrodollars through the import of materials controled by the petrodollar coalition.
Comment 113.4	@mgc7199 I bet the arguments to remain will be exactly the same. Remainers are like a stuck record üòÇ
Comment 113.5	@mgc7199 we already had a second referendum. The first was in the 70s. See you in 50 years.
Comment114	Boris Johnson just surrendered de facto control over Northern Ireland to the EU. So much for the recovery of sovereignty argument!
Comment 114.1	"Politico shows how the new voting cuts out half of those that voted leave, please pass this on, its urgent<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYhwy18zJc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYhwy18zJc</a>"
Comment 114.2	@Wesley Slippers we also created Belgium out of &quot;thin air&quot; so we should disband that too.
Comment 114.3	So True.  He put lipstick on Theresa&#39;s Pig.  They should have just kept her as PM. At least she was more honest.
Comment 114.4	Hey nothing as such happened,,, I stay in Belfast
Comment115	Britain is goin to do amazing after leaving. Merkel has said her self that UK economy will be bigger then the EU after leaving match the us and China. Let&#39;s get this done and let&#39;s put the great back in Britain
Comment 115.1	@danut avram Yeah...Not going to happen Scotland has already been told no by Merkel unless their bring the Bank of England with them same applies to the Welsh and we British have had enough of people trying to split our sacred sceptred isle up! were out of EU land....
Comment 115.2	After NI and Scotland will split out ;)))
Comment 115.3	@Dean Rowley damn who let grandpa on the internet again
Comment 115.4	@J Reeves what is
Comment 115.5	@Tom Clarke yes it will it has done before why can&#39;t it again
Comment116	My prediction: deal will be concluded; Parliament will reject it; extension will be requested; Eu will grant it
Comment 116.1	Extension will not be asked for because under the royal perogative powers invested in the PM he and the foreign Secretary can rescind the 1972 European Communittee&#39;s Act that took us into the EC/EU without having to go through Parliament!. The question is Does boris have the brass balls to do it?
Comment 116.2	Bo Jo wants a no deal
Comment117	Tusk king of Europe is most corrupt person in EU .Junker is alcoholic drunk all the time .Melker has Parkinson disease.
Comment118	No deal please
Comment 118.1	@Paul Drive idiot.
Comment 118.2	@Gordon Pattison  to Quote D.Cameron &quot;it is remain a member of the EU or Leave ALTOGETHER!&quot; so what part of &quot;Leave Altogether&quot; don&#39;t you get? and your the one insulting others.....
Comment 118.3	Idiot
Comment119	A ‚ÄúDeal‚Äù means a betrayal of Brexit. <br />Give us a clean break Boris or face the Brexit party.
Comment120	The lovely Laura ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Comment 120.1	Ugly skank.
Comment121	There is no deal to be had when the EU won&#39;t budge!
Comment 121.1	who even triggered these brexit?
Comment 121.2	Mack Von Lubbers EU gone corrupt UK only if get chance to do this.
Comment 121.3	And so be it then.<br />What requires any deal for departure?<br />The UK won&#39;t budge on wanting a deal.<br />Don&#39;t stand at the door twittering and slam it before the time up buzzer sounds off, close the door quietly and send your tatas by post once you are gone, eh mate!
Comment 121.4	I‚Äôm blocking you now...
Comment 121.5	Sir Jimmy Savile Shalom Viva Obama.
Comment122	Looks like this nightmare might be coming to an end.
Comment 122.1	@Simon West Scotland wants its independence the Irish style
Comment 122.2	This nightmare will never really end, whether there is a deal or not. Leaving the EU pretty much guarantees that Scotland will leave the UK in order to rejoin the EU, so there&#39;s all of that still to look forward to.
Comment 122.3	in<br />sha allah
Comment123	On referendum night BBC.  I watched for 5 hours. The word &quot;deal&quot; was not used once. Or &quot; crash up a cliff!&quot;.
Comment 123.1	@jodonbaker43 just shows how much worse they have got. On the night Laura kussenburg and Dimbleby really loving the first 10 minutes.  Laughing and joking  as remain was doing well. Visibly crushed by the end.
Comment 123.2	That&#39;s because you were watching the Brussels broadcasting corporation. The worst biased propaganda gutter press.
Comment 123.3	@Eusunt Dac what was said was, article 50 would be enacted, that a leaver would now have to be the prime minister to take us out. And we would try to make a deal and if it wasn&#39;t good enough we would leave on WTO. This was after the result came in. Seemed reasonable, simple and fair.
Comment 123.4	Maybe it should have and then, we wouldn&#39;t be in the mess we are in now but obviously nobody had enough insight to see this far.
Comment124	To deal or not to deal, that was the question. The final act of the British departure from Europe is more suspenseful than any cinematic playwright has been able to pen to date, although we don&#39;t foresee much of a thrill in the finale. Such an historical play on the world stage, and what we get is suspense and disarray. The only theme to the story depends on the lack of concern on the part of Europe, for, alas, there have been no demands nor even requests that the British stay in the limelights of Europe or even of the world stage.
Comment 124.1	@Mack Von Lubbers now you sound like Russell Brand I&#39;m going off you...
Comment 124.2	@Joe Bloggs. not right sure, bloke about the, er, what you say YouTube item, still there are schnapps und schnapps for any backhand comparison to scientifically authentic originations of befuddlements, eh?
Comment 124.3	A nice read and you even wrote an historical. Is this YouTube?
Comment125	There smiling we have been duped  Why the big rush after 31/2 years.
Comment126	Fuck Brexit
Comment127	so just when will boris johnson blink first &amp; let down all his fanatical devoted desperate followers?
Comment 127.1	we all knew borra would bottle it; the only way he can endear himself to the brexiteers is by going  to prison &#39;to make a stand for the british people &amp; democracy&#39;!!<br />but he couldn&#39;t go more than a day, without a carrie or a jennifer sharing his bed, although he might find some tattooed, man mountain, who swings both ways, sharing his cell.
Comment 127.2	leavers, remainers &amp; the tories are to blame for the mess the uk is in; it has nothing to do with corbyn.<br />the binary referendum vote was the problem; neither leave or remain questioned the politicians about any long term implications; after all, the uk has not exactly been flourishing under the tories whilst we have been in the eu.<br />we have a verbal civil war fight now, that could turn nasty; <br />if it was down to corbyn alone, the uk would leave the eu, but still retain close links with them, but he needs the help of all labour mps to help him overthrow the tory government.
Comment 127.3	cheers,<br />sitting on the fence is the democratic way in some people&#39;s eyes; unless it comes to trebling university fees.<br />my politics are left of corbyn &amp; right of trump, but this, a commie or a fascist, does not, me make.<br />i&#39;m opposed to same sex marriage, teaching 4yo&#39;s about sex, legalisation of cannabis, israel&#39;s treatment of palestine, trident, religion, history, flags, hypocrisy &amp; injustice, but i do believe in democracy.
Comment 127.4	cheers, <br />assuming your comment was aimed at me, trust me i&#39;m not panicking, nor am l desperate; however, most &#39;ardent&#39; brexiteers will be disappointed with johnson, when he turns out to be a false idol &amp; doesn&#39;t go the whole hog &amp; leave without a deal.<br />the tories alone are responsible for the mess we are in, although both remainers &amp; brexiteers are also partly responsible for accepting a binary vote without asking  any questions.<br />everybody has their own interpretation about leaving the eu, which has been the real stumbling block; if it was a straight vote of leave or remain,<br />then whether it is a soft or hard brexit, it shouldn&#39;t matter, because those choices weren&#39;t on the table initially; personally, i am a leaver, but i would prefer labour to take us out of the eu than the tories; however, i am also a democrat &amp; i believe the tories alone should negotiate to leave the eu, because it was they who called the referendum &amp; it was they whom the british public voted for at the last election to continue to have brexit talks with the eu; this would make corbyn neither responsible or blameless for the success or failure  of brexit.<br />johnson&#39;s bottle has gone &amp; soon people will be thinking labour&#39;s deal isn&#39;t so bad after all, although i don&#39;t think remain should be an option; maybe, labour&#39;s deal plays no deal.<br />but this is all talk &amp; speculation - if it was down to me, i wouldn&#39;t let anybody know my brexit plans until an election is called; why give the right wing media a chance to make any comments?<br />don&#39;t forget, corbyn can say what he likes, but until there is an election &amp; he gains power, he can&#39;t do anything.<br />immigration  control is all that matters to me; immigration &amp; capitalism doesn&#39;t work together.
Comment 127.5	It&#39;s happened. He has no leverage ans will sign the extension. If not the courts can<br />Read the Benn Act. <br />Bretards have lost. Fine,  move on and lynch BoZo and Mogg.<br /><br />Unless Bretards are totally gutless of course.
Comment128	Getting ready to tick off my remoaner bingo card as I read through the comments...

Comment 129.3	@Joe Bloggs. look it up there&#39;s plenty of videos on here the wealthy elite backing  betting on no-deal, just a reality check of factual things or so-called but under the belt mush
Comment 129.4	Seek help.
Comment130	Haha, its the same deal, BJ even gave the EU more, rofl.
Comment 130.1	No i think boris knows this deal won&#39;t pass so when it doesn&#39;t he&#39;ll say good bye eu i tried eventhough he say&#39;s he&#39;ll seek an extinchion
Comment 130.2	@Murder Doll didn&#39;t you know that the fishing licences have already been sold to foreign fleets, mainly the Spanish.
Comment 130.3	Murder Doll fisheries catches will always be negotiated internationally so not really
Comment 130.4	Hilarious it‚Äôs the principles of a deal the EU suggested 3 years ago
Comment 130.5	@abugina But the Great British mainland will be out of the customs union, single market, we will have our fisheries back, ect.
Comment131	When I see Steve Barclay try to rush a deal the negotiations seem false. Rushing to get a deal that will not be acceptable ? In negotiations you need to look at who you are negotiating with. Johnson and his cabal who will undermine democracy and commit unlawful acts  on one side hardly inspires confidence.
Comment 131.1	@J Reeves you really haven&#39;t a clue...
Comment 131.2	For the EU it&#39;s the Ideal time to negotiate.  Boris is desperate for a deal at this point an will probably give them almost anything.
Comment 131.3	It isn&#39;t rushed. Most of the groundwork was laid down already. We have had three and a half years. Contrary to popular opinion, all the negotiators have worked hard, on both sides.
Comment132	Boris has met with the PM of ROI and the EU to push forward with the deal but this is one major piece of the jigsaw missing and that is an agreement with NI and therefore the DUP
Comment 132.1	@MikeT yeah, they used to give the conservatives a majority. Not sure why they are able to hold things up now though.
Comment 132.2	Wesley Slippers God bless this mess.
Comment 132.3	@Wesley Slippers Totally agree but they made the Conservative Government majority
Comment 132.4	Wesley Slippers UK wants to be another Greece France or Spain or not.
Comment 132.5	DUP don&#39;t speak for NI majority.
Comment133	üõëNO DEAL IS THE ONLY DEAL ILE ACCEPT ON HALLOWEENüéÉüõë
Comment 133.1	@Chelsey Reid  Not at the cost of being tied in like a vassal state unable to make our own trade deals,regulated by Brussels and have our armed forces control from Paris and Berlin!
Comment 133.2	Desmond Alloffo why? Don‚Äôt you want any trade deals?
Comment134	I just hope whatever outcome Brexit entails, I pray it does not wreck the UK‚Äôs economy and small businesses and of course lead to a resumption of violence in Ireland over the border. Good luck.
Comment 134.1	Well is too late for that the damage is already done, most of the industrial companies  have move to EU members, regardless of you guys stay or leave, will be hard attract them back after all thats transcended. You guys focus so much in a nationalism ideal, and forgot the bread in the table. Hope all that mess fet fixed asap.
Comment 134.2	@mgc7199 not to me it isn&#39;t. To whom else are you writing? The voices in your head?
Comment 134.3	@Joe Bloggs. That label is entirely accurate. If you&#39;d have done your research, you&#39;d have known that.
Comment 134.4	@mgc7199 stop trying to tell people what they think and using inaccurate labels like populist. All my opinions are my own, thanks.
Comment 134.5	@Joe Bloggs. Apparently you do. You&#39;re the victim of populism of the worst kind. Your democracy is fubar. Go back to school.
Comment135	There was a deal. But rejected by parliament. What‚Äôs the difference with this one. Parliament will reject all deals. Parliament also reject no deal. What‚Äôs wrong with the system?
Comment 135.1	@andrew30 all any of us can do is sit tight and see what happens best of luck we&#39;re all going to need it so it&#39;s as well laugh as cry
Comment 135.2	walter mitty if you can‚Äôt laugh at this what can you do?? The funniest thing is that personally, because of my business, brexit is ‚Äòkerching‚Äô for me, ‚Äúshow me the money‚Äù but sadly I have a good idea of the future
Comment 135.3	@andrew30 nice to see someone with a sence of humer anyways
Comment 135.4	walter mitty üòÖüòÇü§£
Comment 135.5	To put it delicately you&#39;re parliment doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s a shite or a haircut it want&#39;s
Comment136	Boris Johnson just surrendered Northern Ireland to get a Brexit deal.
Comment 136.1	@Dave Palmer the Internet is full of loons. Most are just people from 4chan causing trouble to amuse themselves. Just join in, it&#39;s quite fun üòÇ I think the sensible majority are behind Boris, there are radical elements on both sides. I suppose you need every colour to make a rainbow. That sounded less gay in my head, like my voice üòÇ
Comment 136.2	@Joe Bloggs.Well that sounds fair enough sir  - sorry it&#39;s just there&#39;s a suspicious number of anonymous sounding accounts advocating no deal, or just repeating Boris 100%, or variants thereof, on pretty much every online platform. Would love to know who&#39;s behind them, it looks super orchastrated, but those accounts don&#39;t normally reply like you have.
Comment 136.3	@Dave Palmer I find it ironic that you subscribe to real science and msnbc, that news channel is deluded, like most of the news in the USA, to be honest.
Comment 136.4	@Dave Palmer to hide my identity. Isn&#39;t that why everyone uses a fake name? It&#39;s YouTube and the world is full of weirdos. I&#39;m a real boy, don&#39;t worry üòâ
Comment 136.5	@Joe Bloggs. To be fair that is funny, but why do you use a fake name?
Comment137	Good
Comment138	Brexit ain&#39;t gonna happen.
Comment 138.1	Wrong - as the commence order was signed weeks ago !
Comment 138.2	@Y Ddraig Goch bet you buy a scratch card on your way to the pub after you collect it üòÇüòâ
Comment 138.3	@Joe Bloggs. Nos da Joe. Gotta go to bed now, must be up early to go cash my giro.
Comment 138.4	@Y Ddraig Goch you love me really. Nos da.
Comment 138.5	@Joe Bloggs. that actually made me laugh. Good one. You&#39;re still a loser tho ;)
Comment139	Yeasssssss... Brexit is only two weeks away!!!
Comment140	NO DEAL IS THE ONLY WAY!
Comment 140.1	I am here to help you with your path following my father&#39;s path to pardise
Comment 140.2	@Pro Mc you sound the same but for remain instead
Comment 140.3	@Dave I see you&#39;ve fell for shite fed to you by the elite farage and moggs. What a fool. Can you not think for yourself instead of parroting shite you&#39;ve heard from them?
Comment 140.4	Actually thinking about it... Is there such thing as no deal?
