Comment1	My feeling is that this portrayal of the Queen is not as sympathetic aa Claire Foy&#39;s portrayal..No blame on Olivia. She is just doing her job and reading her lines(brilliantly). The Queen is not going to shine as much as in previous episodes..My recollection IS that during this time period Queen Elizabeth was not that popular as she is now. So I feel this cast and these Seasons are likely going to hit the nail on the head as far as the realism of those years..<br />Queen Elizabeth was not the people&#39;s princess. It was NEVER her way.
Comment2	progressive derangement syndrome
Comment3	Love olivia but I don&#39;t buy her as Elizabeth
Comment 3.1	Olivia&#39;&#39;s portrayal may be more like the real Elizabeth.
Comment4	they shouldnt have changed the original cast for the next story set in 70s..they should have aged the original actors then bring this new lot for say season 4 or 5 when they jump to 90s<br /><br />Also I wish they got Helen Miren as the queen

Comment 15.1	It&#39;s Welsh. He&#39;s being invested as the Prince of <i>Wales.</i>
Comment16	I think Olivia Colman personally doesn&#39;t play the queen well in the clips I&#39;ve seen so far. Claire Foy played the role excellently and far better. Also the queen doesn&#39;t have rhoticism like Colman, it&#39;s a very bad casting choice I think. I think everyone would have much prefered they had just use some prosthesis to age Foy and Smith. I really hope Colman hasn&#39;t ruined the show completely.
Comment17	I hate celebrities, and I&#39;m gonna tear them all down.  It just so happens that I have a bunch of them that are crazy obsessed with me.  I&#39;m just playing around now, while they are given the opportunity to prove themselves to me, and if one wants to win, then she&#39;ll bring me dinner.  Otherwise, I&#39;m hoping to have a real  Lady furnished and adorned for me.  The Lady isn&#39;t a clown jester entertainer.  I&#39;m gonna rub it on their loser faces.

Comment19	Helena Bonham Carter played the queen mother in the kings speech and is now playing princess margaret in this series
Comment 19.1	She was great in the former, I don&#39;t really buy her as the later, though I am willing to be proved wrong
Comment 19.2	I&#39;m not at all excited about that.
Comment 19.3	She was crap in the Kings Speech and likely crap in this too.
Comment20	It took them two whole years premiere season 3. It better be good!
Comment 20.1	@Eugene Murphy Fat lotta good that will do you. Only thing it MAY do is have them KEEP these stars through the last Seasons, but even that, maybe not the WHOLE cast. Also, you cannot judge these clips on the whole two Seasons...you are not giving it a chance.
Comment 20.2	@Soufian 27 all i know is that if I&#39;m disappointed, I&#39;m gonna write a letter to the team informing them of my disapproval.
Comment 20.3	@Soufian 27 let&#39;s hope you&#39;re right
Comment 20.4	I believe they shot series 3 and 4 back to back, meaning the next season won‚Äôt come out before the end of 2020
Comment 20.5	I think they wanted us to get the old stars out of our system...
