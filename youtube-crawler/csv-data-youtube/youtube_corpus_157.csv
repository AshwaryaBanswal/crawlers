Comment23	Why? Because USA, France, Germany armed YPG / PKK with thousands of trucks load heavy arms and positioned all towards Turkey alongside the border. French company Lafarge built a cement factory and engineered YPG militia to dig many concrete tunnels under the border right into Turkish side.  And inevitably Turkey bombed and pushed out YPG / PKK rats.. not Kurds. <br />After any fight if Turks prevailed same scenario played by Western media;  Lets cry..

Comment41	Donald fuck
Comment42	Fuck turckey
Comment43	Finally, people are going to believe the Kurds when they have been saying ALL this time, Turkey has been supporting ISIS. The leader of ISIS was found in a Turkish controlled region of Nothern Syria, there is NO way he was there without the Turks knowing, meaning he was probably being protected by the Turks. The evidence is clear as day. F*ck the Turkish Terrorist Government.
Comment44	"The terrorist organization PKK/PYD-YPG :<br />Terrorism and violence are the most significant<br />challenges that the humanity has ever faced during<br />the 21st century. Terrorist organizations, as the actors<br />of this environment defined as ‚Äúthe wars for power‚Äù<br />within the security literature are able to have a<br />transboundary mandate and set their objectives and<br />strategies in line with these purposes.<br />The Democratic Union Party (PYD), which is the Syria<br />extension of the PKK/KCK terrorist organization that<br />has been operating within our territories for many<br />years, on the one hand, seeks to introduce itself as<br />a legal organization at the world public opinion<br />and on the other hand, attempts to turn the internal<br />conflicts within Syria into an opportunity through the<br />political and logistical support provided by certain<br />international actors.<br />By means of its armed units called People‚Äôs Protection<br />Units (YPG), the PYD seeks to give the impression of<br />being an organization that fights against the DEASH<br />terrorist organization at the world public opinion. As<br />a matter of fact, it is recognized that the PYD/YPG is<br />the PKK/KCK terrorist organization‚Äôs wing in Syria and<br />their targets, structure and functioning correspond<br />and it operates within the same structure, as well as<br />it is not a different and independent formation from<br />the PKK/KCK. Contrary to what is being introduced,<br />the PYD is the PKK/KCK‚Äôs extension in Syria that is<br />registered as a ‚Äúterrorist organization‚Äù under the list<br />of international terrorist organizations.<br />There is plenty of evidence which illuminate the<br />organic linkage between the PYD and the PKK terrorist<br />organisation. Above all, the PYD was established at<br />the 8th Congress of the PKK, upon the orders of the<br />instigator Abdullah √ñcalan, sent from ƒ∞mralƒ± where<br />he is imprisoned and the decisions made for ‚Äúthe<br />restructuring in Iran, Iraq and Syria, alongside Turkey‚Äù<br />on 17 October 2003.<br />Within this context, the PKK/KCK terrorist organisation,<br />which aims to unite the so-called autonomous<br />administration areas in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria<br />under the name of the KCK and to establish an<br />independent State, deployed some of its forces in<br />Syria for its KCK project, by taking advantage of the<br />situation in Syria."
Comment45	The terrorist organization PKK/PYD-YPG committed yet another heinous crime against humanity today. They killed two civilians, including a baby, in a mortar attack against Ak√ßakale, a Turkish town at the Syrian border.
Comment46	Why is Turkey bombing the PKK/YPG terrorists in Syria?

Comment56	Not Kurds Bombing PKK Terrorist
Comment57	Who are the turks? They are the people who:<br /><br />killed 50,000+ kurds in genocide of Zilan ( including children and women, raped and buried alive after undressing them as an offence ) in 1930.<br />killed thousands of kurdish activists.<br /><br />Since 1984 :<br />killed over 40,000 kurdish civilians.<br />Imprisoned 80,000 kurdish activists.<br />Destroyed over 4000 kurdish villages.<br />Forcibly relocated over 3 million kurds.<br /><br />Been denied their cultural &amp; language rights.<br />Faced extreme torture and sexual abuse from police.<br />Suffered systematic oppression in all areas of life.<br /><br /><br />all of this facism made turks proud, so they insisted maintaining their disgusting project on kurds for 21th century <br /><br />after kurds of turkey, Now that&#39;s time to kurds of syria and iraq.<br /><br />in 2014 while kurds of syria established the uniform force the fight the most dangerous threat in the region ISIS , turkey opened their borders to ISIS to flood into syria. while the world focused on destoeying ISIS, turkey were fighting the kurds of syria but not a single ISIS member. ISIS in front ane turkey in back tried their best to kill kurds of syria.<br /><br />in 2017 while kurds of iraq held in iraqi kurdistan independence movement, turkey was the first country stood aganist it and they backed iraqi millitans and turkmens as the result hundreds of kurds dead and many kurdish women raped<br /><br />Till i write this comment, turkey continues their aggression on kurds

Comment64	Bekasur kudro par aatankwadi turki NE hamla kar diya .ab turki ka ant aa gya hai
Comment65	First of all Turkey is not bombing Kurds, Turkey is bombing YPG. And YPG is not a &quot;Kurds Fighters&quot;. It&#39;s a Terorist organization. More over than 20 million Kurdish people are living in Turkey right now. Turkey had even Kurdish presedent and there are kurdish people in goverment right now. There are married people kurdish-turkish. Why don&#39;t you consider and never talk about this ?

Comment71	Ohh dear global mainstream media. I really understand what you are doing. TURKEY against the PKK, not Kurds! You says lie about it. This is TRUTH and reality. There are hundereds of thousends Syrian Kurdish refugees in Turkey now. They were not only escape from DAES, also YPG( Syrian wing of PKK). It is funny about BBC had showed the world YPG allowed DAES terrorists to exit Raqqa as alive &amp; safe. This is a dirty game and Turkey is the most &quot;clean&quot; players on table...

Comment83	Hello everyone, My name‚Äôs Muhammad and I‚Äôm 20 Years old. I use to love turkey and UK and USA and even sometimes take Donald T as meme or  jokes with my friends and myself. I just wanted to say the world of politician ruined my life. I dreamt to learn english and dreamt to visit America, but what ever i did it was just like an illusion. Even when i was playing online video games people use to call me terrorist although I am the prey. It‚Äôs been a nice life i really wanted to share love and devotion to my foreign families, but i‚Äôve just failed my mission and my hope. Soon my Country and me we‚Äôll become history and i know that you will be happy about that.

Gangsters and thugs all that kill their own Kurdish people if they don&#39;t support them very similar to how the Taliban has operated.    These gangs have been doing incursions into Turkey to blow people up since at least 1978.     The people that Turkey sent into Syria are &quot;rebels from the Syrian national army&quot;, LOL.    So, basically Syrians are invading their own country.    Nowhere but the Middle East could we have a cluster fark this big.
Comment118	Great work by turkey ‚ô•Ô∏è

Comment124	The US government is the largest terrorist organization in the world and they kill more innocent civilians then all countries combined, but because of the Government controlled media people don‚Äôt see the truth and are told what the government wants people to believe, just like the Kentucky shootings being displayed as turkey assaulting Syria and did the public get angry they were lied too ? No they don‚Äôt want to care as long as they can have their precious money and vain possessions. Americans are like little children who want the nicest toy, so they can show it off . The police murder innocent people more than any terrorist organizations do and nobody says anything to them and why are they not forced into reporting how many they kill . Why won‚Äôt Americans stand up and offset this government and create a new one like we were told to do when it becomes like it is now ?

Comment128	The illegal attack on the Kurds by the Turkish army is a serious betrayal of the anti-terrorist agreement. It is a continuation of anti-human atrocities against the Syrian Assad terrorist organization. That is to say, the Turkish government has become a member of the Arab Islamic Islamic terrorist organization and an accomplice. The Turkish army has attacked the Kurds by force.  It has been proven that the Turkish government has publicly declared war on peace-loving human beings around the world.  All human righteous forces should stand with the Kurds and fight against the terrorist terrorist violence in Turkey until the Turkish terrorist armed forces are completely eliminated.

Comment131	Dear Editor,<br />Can anyone remember when the &quot;Mainstream Media&quot; ignored  Obama and Hillary  arming ISIS to invade Syria? How Obama released  5 major terrorists from GITMO  to recover one captured US Army traitor ?  How Obama allowing the &quot;Osama Bin Laden Brigade &quot;to help take out Assad?<br /> Named after, You know, the same Bin Laden  that Obama boasted about killing?  <br /><br /> The Kurds were total nomads up to WW I! Since then their MO  was to occupy other other people&#39;s buildings, much like Hermit Crabs.  So now Syria will work with the Kurds and  Russians to police that region  at no cost of money or lives to us! That should be good news! But the rabid Trump detractors will never give Trump credit for anything good.
Comment132	This report is a perfect reflection of neo marxist, leftist ideologies whic have been ruining countries, especially european countries, and societies for quite some time. They see people only in broad group identies. For example, in this case, they see all the Kurds in one group and to them all Kurds are the same, share the same values and can not exist in different frames of actualities.<br />Turkey doesn&#39;t fight Kurds in Syria. Turkey has around 20 million Kurdish citizens which consist of %25 of the population in Turkey. Turkey has 400k Syrian Kurdish refugees. Turkey fights YPG because YPG support PKK (in actuality YPG and PKK is the same) and PKK is recognised as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, USA, EU and NATO.<br />I am a random person on youtube and I know these but BBC don&#39;t, eh? <br />BBC which is driven by socialist agendas reflects the events like this: Turkey kills YPG-PKK forces which are Kurds in Syria. All Kurds are the same. So YPG-PKK represents all Kurds. So, Turkey fights Kurds, Turkey kills Kurds.<br /><br />BBC is not trustworthy.

Comment175	LMAO at all the turks in the comments section simply referring to other historical wars that happened in the past. What a way to argue!!<br />Your president is a numb authoritarian who&#39;s giving asylum to Daesh scum, he won&#39;t even deliver the terrorists to the home countries so they can prosecute them. Erdogan has wet dreams of an islamic Osman empire... keep dreaming!

Comment183	Simple,, Turkey wants to weaken Kurds so they don&#39;t get their independence. How? Kill civilan Kurds in Syria until they emigrate then bring other human race in their lands to split Kurds in Turkey from others in Syria.
Comment184	The today Kurds are the descendants of the Ottoman Empire in ancient times.  They were the bravest and smartest ethnic to rule today&#39;s Middle East and Europe areas.  But now they are being viewed as terrorists that have no place to call a homeland.  We need to save the Kurds in order to save this intelligent and brave gene of mankind.

Comment195	BBC = CORRUPT <br />all bullcrap fake news
Comment196	Turkey many years living together with kurds. Kurds and Turks are not enemies. Pkk/Ypg does not represent Kurds.
Comment 196.1	@the arabian falcon WE WUZ KANGZ Turkish army has kurdish soldiers. 8th president of the Turkey was dear Kurdish Turgut Ozal. Read the history before write a comment if you are not a troll.
Comment 196.2	Selim Araz Lying ü§•
Comment197	the kurds being attacked are in 2 terrorist organizations =PKK and YPG= they have bombed many people not just Turks.
Comment198	BBC propaganda at its Best!
Comment199	That orange dumb animal and the republican regime.
Comment200	Why is america bombing afghanistan , yemen ?
Comment 200.1	Becs al queda
Comment 200.2	@Oz jak you are brainwashed
Comment 200.3	@Amed Zaxo sorry dude, you are delusional, pkk will be cut from Turkey with safe zone and Kurdish ppl in Turkey don&#39;t support war anymore. If Turks hate Kurds, who voted for √ñzal ? Plus Turkey is not a  small island country, you can not take decision without parlement and at his time especially without military. Pkk is established  in 1978 when Turkish left wing in her peek time, when Turkey was getting closer to USSR. Pkk was created by Turkish secret intelligent that was ruled by cia at that time . Purpose was to make Turkey nationalist and conservative. 2 years later coup also helped a lot for that. What I try to tell you don&#39;t fight with Turkey, try embrace your being Kurdish as a Turkey citizen if you are. Plus I can&#39;t imagine pkk established a country in Syria, they would kill millions of their own people. Many Kurdish tribe including Iraq kurds doesn&#39;t like PKK.
Comment 200.4	@Oz jakexample for genocides tha turkey conducted: <br />1- Syrian kurds<br />2- Agiri genocide<br />3- ko√ßgiri genocide <br />4- dersim genocide<br />5- palo genocide<br />6-Diyarbekir genocide <br />7- Marash genocide<br />8- Shirnakh , jazeer and Nusebin genocide<br />9- Roboski genocide<br />10- Wan genocide ( 33 kur≈üun)<br />11- Armenian genocide<br />12- Qubres genocide<br />And many many other genocides <br />You are not doing genocide to kill people you are doing genocides to language and culture.<br />For the PKK you fighting for more than 30 years but PKK is getting more stronger, PKK is not terrorist organization all they did asking for Kurdish people rights, according to the nowadays statistics in turkey only 15% of Kurdish youth can speak Kurdish. <br />When Saddam attacked Kurds they went to Diyarbekir Kurdistan capital and Mu≈ü which Kurdistan and president Turgut Ozal helped them he was Kurdish, later you executed him. <br />In the Iran don&#39;t say I think because you know nothing about Kurdish situation there, but Iran is better than turkey more much they have opened Kurdish radio more than 60 years and Kurdish are speaking their  own Kurdish accent and waring their clothes <br />But you don&#39;t know what is happening there
Comment 200.5	@Amed Zaxo there isn&#39;t any genocide in Turkey. Kurdish party is legally and officially part of Turkish parlement. The ones who support terrorism are jailed. Pkk lost millions of supporter in Turkey and still loosing, people are bored of terrorism. I don&#39;t think Iran is racist towards Kurds aswell, Iran is combine of many other nations , Persians are just 50%. Don&#39;t forget when Saddam attacked Kurds with chemicals, Turkey was the one opened borders, sheltered them . There wasn&#39;t USA or EU  there but Turkey to help. If there is an awful earthquake or sthg , Turkey , Iran will be the first who will come to help to Kurds. I can see autonomous regions, and maybe more in future when middle east as rich and educated as Europe but all these fights serve others&#39; interest now.
Comment201	America is a terrible country I am Turkish and I live here and I get attacked for my race everyday. Americans think they are the center of the world
Comment 201.1	no, they&#39;re not the center of the world but they&#39;re the center of Lucifer and the center of evil...
Comment202	Free palastine
Comment203	Because the USA turned Kurds into a terrorist threat promising them Turkey/Syria/Iraq land in exchange for killing and overthrowing those governments.
Comment204	You must change the headline<br />should be, <br />‚Äú Why Turk killing ypg, pkk militant‚Äù
Comment205	Now where are pakistanis,<br />Turkey is killing Kurds and no one is helping Kurds,<br />I am from India, but we will stand with Kurds, humanity, <br />This world is full of evil.
Comment206	Trump is the only president in the world that can cause World War 3 and press the Nuke button.
Comment207	We categorically reject the false equation of Syrian Kurds with the terrorist organization PKK.The terrorists invaded NE Syria, a predominantly Sunni Arab area, imposed its Marxist-Leninist ideology on the local population, and exiled or killed anyone that challenged its rule.
Comment208	stop blaming usa, protest turkey

Comment217	My limited tolerance of Trump has vanished. This is everybit as noxious as the Red Army stopping outside Warsaw to allow the Germans to massacre the Polish rebels.
Comment218	God says love everyone , every race , every person on earth üåç. Love your neighbor .  Stop the wars ,  don‚Äôt fight or hate ,  Trump is right no more wars. America has been fighting these terrorist around the world üåé for so long and protect the entire world üåé. We‚Äôve given trillions. To help people.

Comment219	Bloody turkey is responsible for war again in Syria....They will do genocide on kurds
Comment 219.1	America etc is responsible for the war in Syria . Brought &quot;democrasy &quot; to Syria as to Iraq killing millions. There are millions of Kurdish people in Turkey in every city. They are living as everybodyelse is. Pkk is also trading narcotics. There&#39;s nothing like genocide.

Comment 240.2	We are bombing terrorists not Kurds. If you are against Turkey in this, it means you are supporting baby killers.
Comment241	Ah, OBJECTIVE news at its finest. You&#39;re only fooling people that live in Europe and NA because they don&#39;t have much alternative medias to turn to. You&#39;re not fooling people who have access to other sources besides your sources and really see things for how they are. But you do you BBC, keep tailoring together a bunch of irrelevant clips and talk about things that are the complete opposite of what&#39;s going on like straight out of 1984.
Comment 241.1	Hi
Comment242	Checkmate!
Comment243	Why is Turkey bombing a terrorist organization? There, God I can&#39;t believe I have to correct you on your headlines.
Comment244	Well it goes back for centuries, we are talking Ottoman Empire age,  look this is a mess the UK should not get involved in, the public has no stomach for another damn war in the middle east.
Comment 244.1	@venbolo Much further back then even that, There has been war here since the creation of ancient Egypt.
Comment 244.2	This place has been in perpetual chaos since western powers took over.

Comment247	Funny that NO TV channel or journalist talks about &quot;PKK&quot;; a terrorist group that has killed thousands since 1984.<br /><br />If Turkey wanted to kill Kurds, they could and would EASILY kill the Kurdish people who are LIVING in Turkey NOW<br /><br />This is not about Kurds. This war has been going on since 1984 and has been only against this TERRORIST GROUP PKK.<br /><br />I feel sorry for these Kurdish people. Both because their families are in war zone but also for being SO DISHONEST for trying to show Turkey as the guilty party here. It is pathetic that NONE of them are talking about PKK. <br /><br />Sad!
Comment248	we indians support kurds and their home land .<br />why Turkey is  burning their own dirty ass...........!
Comment 248.1	‡§∞‡§£‡§µ‡•Ä‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§ø‡§π‡§Å ‡§ñ‡§®‡§Å‡§ó‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤ Have you ever heard of the Great Middle East project? The reason why Muslims kill Muslims is that America and other countries want to confuse Middle Eastern countries through religion. They reveal a religious leader. They secretly support them. People in the middle east are starting to see this leader as a God because unfortunately they‚Äôre ignorant. And they kill themselves. Thus, America and other countries do not even have to use their weapons. America wanted to do the same in Turkey. They even tried to make a coup but we opposed it. The religious leader Fetullah G√ºlen, who made the coup, lives in America right now. We wanted him back but USA didn‚Äôt give. This is a obvious proof.<br /><br />Also you can‚Äôt say ‚Äúyou&#39;re doing ethnic and religious cleansing‚Äù. Is Africa was exploiting by Turks? Are Jews were chopped by Turks? Is atom bomb attack on Japan made by Turks? Is Srebrenitsa genocide made by Turks? What about redskins? Did the Turks slaughter them, too? Turks are one of the most merciful race. But if someone threatens us, we will repay. We never touch innocent people. Only threat.
Comment 248.2	√ñYK√ú  Hindustan respects humanity since from ancient time more than 20 billion  Muslim are proudly living here in our country with dignity and respects they are  businessman scientists lawyers judges engineers corporate leaders. ..serving in defense. ....! more than 90 billion hindus community .<br />rest of sickh community Buddhism Jews Christian&#39;s etc etc .. we adopted very hard  secularism into our constitution  . union republic of india ..during longback 1947..

Comment 248.3	‡§∞‡§£‡§µ‡•Ä‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§ø‡§π‡§Å ‡§ñ‡§®‡§Å‡§ó‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤ What you wrote is a lie! Civilians are not bombed. Your enmity towards the Turks is so obvious. We cannot allow any evil structure that threatens our country under the name of humanity. Then people in ISIS? Let&#39;s not kill them either. Then they come and kill us, right? Ridiculous logic! You&#39;re on the other side of the world. How do you know what&#39;s going on here? I also laughed a lot when you said, &quot;We Indians care very much about human rights.&quot; Aren&#39;t you people who believe in the caste system? Aren&#39;t you the ones who see pariahs as untouchable? Which indians are you talking to? In all the india videos we see that people live in dirty. True, your understanding of humanity is different from ours.

Comment249	While some countries have put an embargo on armes to Turkey....that will be France for instance ....in here we condemn badly the invasion but still selling armes to the aggressor.....personnaly i condemn the all thing and will boycott  my kebab join for at least 24 hours....
Comment 249.1	I don&#39;t get this comment is a mockery or not but I need to tell this anyway. Weapon embargoes does not mean much to Turkey anymore. We build most of our weapons ourselves. Almost 70%
Comment250	Lack of tons of information wouldn&#39;t expect it from bbc. The problem is the title itself, really bad. To answer that simple question you&#39;d need to film at least an hour long documentary. You simply can&#39;t call YPG as kurds also it&#39;s funny that there isn&#39;t any information about the PKK terrorist organization backed by the US, anyway its really wrong to create this &quot;Turkey is being racist&quot; set of mind. Looking at the demographic structure of turkey it isn&#39;t pretty much possible for a turkish citizen to be racist at first place since no one is actually pure &quot;Turkish&quot; here. Everyone is mixed up, and we have a culture which embraces it. In my neighborhood there are 4 Churches, 2 of it being Armenian. We live in a free and a secular country being a terrorist against the state has nothing to do about race. &quot;TuRkS AnD KuRdS ArE HaTiNg EaChOtHeR&quot; my ass.

Comment253	assad for oil may help the kurds, so then turkey steps it up¬†as oil is why he&#39;s in northeast Syria. now we have a proxy war with Russia as they back assad , and &#39;Old Oily Fingers&#39; Recep is our pitbull nato member in the region. a pitbull that per money greed could get WW3 going if we end up fighting Russia over kurds&#39; squatters-regions. crazy world
Comment254	Recently Turkey f&#39;d the USA in that they bought Russian not u.s. defence missile batteries. So giving Turkey carte blanche rights to take the strip of Syria kurds occupy may as its apparently per youtube full of oil, and turkey has been buying isis oil since day one and his son is an oil company principle too. So it may just be another oil deal between Donald and in his case Erdogan - meaning votes for dt as u.s. troops coming home for xmas and turkey getting big oil deposits and maybe now turkey will buy usa patriot missiles etc . thousands of dead kurds? oh they don&#39;t even think about that, in big OIL PIG circles.
Comment255	they didn&#39;t help us in World War 2? Trump&#39;s comments are just embarrassing...
Comment256	Fuck you amarican
Comment257	Wow different story being told. Moron trump had a phone call with Turkish leader then pulled some US troops. Immediately Turkish troops moved in. You have US, UK and French troops now being essentially evacuated. The Kurds, who died in the thousands to help fight ISIS now facing being slaughtered and goodness knows how many ISIS prisoners escaping from the prisons. One has to ask what deal Trump made with Turkey to benefit himself. BBC needs to stop sanitizing
Comment 257.1	By the way there is no way we could accept YPG at our border. They are essentially the Syria wing of PKK who are internationally recognised terrorists that killed 40.000 innocent Turks in last 35 years. The US should have cooperated with Turkey instead of those filthy terrorists.
Comment 257.2	Europe should have taken their prisoners. And YPG (attention to here not Kurds) knew we were coming as soon as US get out of the region.They kept prisoners close to the turkish border to use it as a propaganda tool. I am sure they are releasing them knowingly.
Comment258	Trump has just set ISIS up for a big surge. He has reignited them in a whole new way. Yet he will blame others.
Comment259	BBC is a prejudice news channel... Turkey has disputes with america thats why western media avails every chance that may defame Turkey.... .....BBC is silent over kashmir issue...UNO has given kashmiri people the right to self determination..whether they want to join india or pakistan..pakistan has accepted uno resolution but india has merged kashmir into it against will of kashmiris.<br />kashmiris are boxed in for the last 80 days.<br />Dozens of people shot dead...media has no access to kashmir.....the west has kept its mounth shut over human right violations in kashmir.<br />70 days curfew is also indian brutalism ....but western media is silent over it...<br />We strongly condemn such type of polarised reporting....

Comment266	cahillerin toplandƒ±ƒüƒ± haber kanalƒ± :D
Comment267	U motherfaker trump
Comment268	I used to think BBC make objective news. Now i know that bbc is also another propaganda channel. Not once I heard any of the bbc reporters saying pkk is a terrorist organization and ypg is its extention. However, PKK is an internationally recognized terrorist group and its tight connections with YPG is very well known. Neither PKK nor YPG is representing the kurdish people. Turkey keep saying that they are after pkk and ypg but bbc is insistive that it is just the kurds. Hey BBC! Maybe it is your wish to do so and you are reflecting your wishes onto others. Why do you keep giving misleading information? Is that your new company policy? What is your aim really?
Comment269	Cause they are pussies, and are butthurt from WW1 still.
Comment 269.1	@venbolo Turkey wasn&#39;t defeated in WW1?
Comment 269.2	Learn history
Comment270	Let me explain that you can see that the YPG is linked to the PKK in the previous speeches of Senators Graham and Ashton Carter (25th defense secretary), and I may even leave you a link. In this case, the PKK and the YPG are linked to a terrorist organization. The PKK forcibly kidnapped the children of the Kurds and made them a member of the organization. The Kurds in Syria are also uncomfortable with the YPG&#39;s presence there. As a terrorist group, they harm villages and innocent people there. On the other hand, Turkey, the limits of the terrorist activities and protect the border with Article 51 of the United Nations in Syria to help in the fight against terrorism is justified as specified. Although Turkey is absolutely no intention to invade the land in the region with only clear from the terror of living in its territory and said 4 million refugees trying to provide a safe area, and nobody can blame. I don&#39;t think anyone would allow a state of terror on its border, that&#39;s totally unacceptable.
Comment271	WE DON&#39;T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH KURDS, THEY ARE OUR BROTHERS. WE&#39;RE LIVING TOGETHER IN THIS COUNTRY AND THEY KNOW THAT. OUR PROBLEM IS WITH PKK/PYD. PKK/PYD IS A TERRORIST GROUP AND THEY&#39;RE KILLING OUR CIVILIANS SINCE 1980. THEY&#39;RE KILLING OUR TEACHERS, OUR  CHILDREN, OUR MOTHERS, OUR FATHERS... THAT&#39;S WHY TURKISH ARMY IS FIGHTING WITH PKK/PYD. TURKISH ARMY IS NOT FIGHTING WITH KURDISH PEOPLE, TURKISH ARMY IS FIGHTING WITH TERRORISTS. PKK/PYD IS KILLING KURDISH PEOPLE IN TURKEY TOO. IN MARDIN NUSAYBIN 13 KURDISH PEOPLE KILLED BY PKK/PYD 2 DAYS AGO. I&#39;LL SAY IT AGAIN, WE DON&#39;T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH KURDS. IN TURKEY, EVERY TURKISH PEOPLE HAS A KURDISH FRIEND. WE&#39;RE LIVING TOGETHER. OUR PROBLEM IS WITH TERRORISTS. MAKE SOME RESEARCH ABOUT TERRORISM IN TURKEY AND OPEN YOUR EYES.

Comment286	Those ar not Kurdish people. Over 20 million of Kurdish people live in Turkey and part of Turkey. They are terrorist and killing and bombing even Kurdish people. Do you have an idea how many innocent people killed by PKK &amp; YPG or whichever name you call them???
Comment287	The West Must Keep Out Of These Religious Wars , only supporting Talks

Comment294	as much as we hate america and israel we don&#39;t hate any country
Comment295	So where did these &quot;Kurds&quot; come from if they never had a nation?
Comment 295.1	The Kurds are one of the most oldest ethnic groups that exist in the world although we never had a country we‚Äôve always been around getting ruled over by all different kinds of empires or countries. Kurds originated from the mountains in the Middle East stretching from turkey,Syria,Iraq and Iran we been around for a long time but no realises even one of the Roman generals mentioned us<br />He called the Kurds the people of the mountains and that they had no friends but the mountains <br />I‚Äôm sad to say that‚Äôs quite true üôÅ
Comment 295.2	At least they did not come from Mongolia, and they have never tried to genocide anyone.
Comment 295.3	@Sling Blade interesting thought
Comment 295.4	@Sling Blade Oh, my bad sir, thought you were trolling us just like everyone else.
Comment 295.5	@BeastFromTheMiddleEast was a legit question. No ignorance involved it&#39;s simply to understand how a people can form without a nation. <br />Say I convinced a few million people to identify as Jedi (I think it&#39;s very possible) should we/they be claiming rights to a state also?
Comment296	As human being we need to stop hating each other those holes kids are gods creators. Just put yourself in their shoes for a minute. No one deserves to be suffer. WE can make a difference by sorting love. Trump and Erdogan are same basters.

Comment335	what a lame ass journalist. Stating so called facts. Not daring to speak up his mind.
Comment336	I find Trump hypocritical because USA have helped in Europe during the WW2 after the Russians were winning the war against nazi (Overlord operation was created just after Stalingrad battle won by Russia), and they could not permit Europe to become communist. Now Kurdish have helped a lot the free World, like US citizens because they killed islamic state with their blood and there would have been so many more terrorist attacks without the Kurdish. They owe their own state. I hope Kurdish would not turn bad, such as talibans did after US left them in the 80s when Afganistan&#39;s war ended against Russia. Same story of some kind, again.
Comment337	‚ÄûThe Kurds‚Äú??? So the US bombed the Afghans not the taliban? What a joke..
Comment 337.1	Mr EneSwe any nation that sends its soldiers to the Middle East should know its a waste of life and time and money. This has been demonstrated time after time!
Comment 337.2	Mr EneSwe Because the Middle East is a absolute waste of time, and also 2/3rds of the Russian military is  conscripted. Why should we force men to fight that don‚Äôt want to? In another war we can‚Äôt win. It will just never lack Afghanistan in 89 we lose and pull out after 10 years, and then deal with a more horrible economy than we already have right now. Many people here in Russia, think we should also pull out! Let‚Äôs not be like the Americans and British and stay here for another 20 years what a waste.
Comment 337.3	–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –õ–µ–±–µ–¥–µ–≤ Russia has advantage now. Without american troops and with turkish support Russia has a BIG advantage so why would they pull out?
Comment 337.4	"This has nothing to do with the Americans, people just always blame them for everything. Kurds vs Turkish dates back before America was even a country. The Middle East has always been at constant war, you can‚Äôt fix it!

Comment339	Never trust a news channel that has BBC in its name
Comment340	The conflict between Turks and Kurds predates the  ISIS and Syrian conflict by decades. Because the Kurds contributed to the defeat of ISIS doesn&#39;t mean the Turks should have to forget past grievances and hand over a chunk of Turkey to the PKK. The Turks have every right to create a buffer Zone against an organisation they view as  their historic enemy who wishes them harm. Some of the comments on here claiming Turkey should hand over part of their country to the Kurds for their contributing to the defeat of ISIS are going to be sorely disappointed because Turkey won&#39;t hand part of Turkey to anyone least of all the Kurds.
Comment341	Just because the USA helped the Kurds defeat ISIS, a mutual enemy, doesn&#39;t mean the USA is obligated to keep troops in situ guaranteeing Kurdish independence.<br />If the BBC thinks so strongly about it perhaps they should lobby the EU &amp; UK governments to send troops. Better still I&#39;m sure the BBC would welcome 30 million Kurdish refugees into Europe.
Comment342	Peopel stop saying Why US killed people in Iraq or Saudia in Yemen, the numbers and the war scale are completly different, First the US had a reason to be in Iraq and fight the Taliban, Turkey is using the PKK, as a source to target YPG and SDF as well like they are somehow connected, I wish our Troops would protest and ask to stay, as a Soldier Myself I would have done it.
Comment343	What a contradiction it is that those who announce global wars upon the death of a few people in their countries, are expecting Turkey to bury its head in the sand before the challenge of terrorists who killed thousands of civilians and soldiers!
Comment344	For those who thinks Turkey&#39;s aim is to kill Kurds please keep in mind that there are many races living peacefully in Turkey. I have Kurdish collegues and friends, had classmates. We are against terrorism that threatens our lands which goes back years before even when Erdogan was only a mayor.
Comment345	Donald Trump &quot; The kurds are fighting for their land &quot;<br />Donald Dumb : what about the Palestinians ?
Comment346	Turkey attacking the kurds. meanwhile about 20 million kurds are living in turkey. There is no genocide from the turkish side. Is it really necessary to have a kurdish state? Will all the respect to kurds but i think this is just riddicilous to fight against them. You are fighting, then loosing and then blaiming. Why not just stop fight, live on together and create a good future for your kids :/

Comment376	The question should be why &quot;Kurds&quot;  killed Syrians, Turks and even real Kurds who are religious as Sunni Muslims? The answer is obvious. Turks protecting their borders and unity and for all other obvious issues to those who are familiar with that region.. As British sourced news,  not surprising to see BBC against this righteous action....<br /><br />By the way, please note that PKK/ISIS are not Kurds in reality. They are created by &quot;Middle East, Big Israel Project Owners&quot;and England is one of those., that&#39;s why they are twisting the truth!!!

Beautiful side effect, by the way, that some IS prisoners could free themselves then the whole shit can start all over again

When I was little I do not know why actually still I do not know all reason. But the terorist attack us beacuse they want to have some part of Turkey,Syria... but since Ottoman Empire it is our land they Fight for this and for this reason they killed so much innocent people child and more. In Syria people also died for this reason. And so much of them come to Turkey beacuse all other county did not want them but Turkey help them now in Turkey you can see so much Syrian people they live with us they even have better economy if we compare . You can even see in youtube populer videos in Turkey they are living their life like normal people even in my university I have to 2 Syrian classmate, in my university so much . it is not about Kurds in Turkey there are so much Kurs live to. We never fight with them or never want to distroy. Now turkey try to defence our land our people and they are fight for innocent people.

Comment461	Not Kurds! Turkey is just fighting against terrorists.
Comment462	Kurds in northern Syria ARE terrorists. They are not people fighting for their land. They are no different from ISIS. If Kurds were innocently fighting against ISIS, Turkey would support Kurds because remember, ISIS burned two Turkish soldiers alive. Unfortunately,  YPG is a terrorist organization bombing border towns, attacking cities and innocent civilians in Turkey. Even though I do not like Erdoƒüan, I would support Turkey&#39;s operations to death.
Comment463	"So called Kurdish forces are terrorist YPG-PKK. Mostly population was Arabs and Turkigs within that areas. US brought and weaponized PKK-YPG terrorist organization so in order to win over ISIS. US has an ally Turkey but US prefered PKK-YPG terrorists. After suddenly ISIS fled the area???? YPG occupied the area and destroyed local population datas to remove arabs and turkigs from the region. So a puppet terrorist state was to be foremd to help Israel and US in region as a military area.<br /><br />Still in operation YPG-PKK terrorists are shelling Turkish civilians across the border and within 3 days 17 civilians are dead.<br /><br />This is a US game. YPG-PKK is a terrorist organization and UN reported their Crimes against the population. Turkey in Idlib area cleared ISIS and killed over 3500 ISIS militants. Turkey is the sufferer and real fighting one against ISIS. Now YPG is releasing ISIS terrorists from camps to fight against Turkish Army.<br /><br />Turkey will not allow a YPG-PKK terrorist state at it&#39;s borders. Western media should understand this.<br /><br />Not all Turkish people vote for Erdogan, but 100% of Turkish people is backing this operation as whole country."

Comment525	Trump saying that the Kurds only wanna fight for their own land. They didn&#39;t help in WW2 Well...the Turkish didn&#39;t either!! They had friendship trading deals with the germans AND the allied. Turkish only supported England because England gave a lot of money to Turkey to build their country. Only when Turkey was afraid that Mussolini was gonna take the Mediterranean they joined the British and France. But because of the friendship trading deals, Hitler had no interest in Turkey and turned to USSR. Only when Nazi&#39;s were about to storm into Turkey from Russia, attaturk declared the war on Germany in February 1945. A little late isn&#39;t it???? America used the Kurds in their fight against ISIL. Meanwhile America paid the fighters of ISIL to keep the war going. This all is just a big mess!!! Clean it up Trump!!!

Kurts killed the teachers doctors and our army people back in 1970s whenever we sent help to their cities. How would your country feel if they started killing ur own?
Comment528	Inshort: Kurds are Terrorists and These terrorists got American support for fighting against other Islamic states. BBC Don&#39;t make it complicated, America is the reason for war everywhere.

Comment 530.4	SUS LAN
Comment531	All Trump had to do was leave that tiny US force - around 1,000 soldiers - in place. Turkey did not dare invade when US troops were in harm&#39;s way. Trump&#39;s decision to withdraw those troops has led to hundreds of military and civilian deaths and the death toll will rise into the thousands. Hundreds of thousands are now fleeing for their lives, creating even more instability and chaos. Trump is a monster!
Comment532	BBC only gives you the news you want to hear.<br /><br />BBC is like: &quot;Why is Turkey so genocidal and constantly bombs christian babies?&quot;<br /><br />BBC Turkey is like: &quot;Today Turkey sent troops to protect its borders.&quot;<br /><br />What a hideous, egregious channel
Comment533	Why is Turkey bombing the Kurds? Gog and Magog.
Comment 533.1	@Socialist Cancer, Islamic Ebola fuck off you silly
Comment 533.2	The Kurds have been there for long over a millennium. The turks are mongols from the far east that invaded around 1000 AD, that&#39;s terrorism. Byzantine = turkey, Constantinopole = istanbul. This is the beginning of the Gog and Magog Prophecy in the Bible.
Comment 533.3	Because the Kurds are fighting the Turks for an independent state. Some would call it terrorism.

My words to Every one live safe and wont isis destroy his Contry stand with kurds and dont let Kerdogan Don&#39;t let him destroy the successes of your soldiers and your countries because of the decisions of some presidents who need psychiatrists like Trump.
Comment548	Erdogan is isis and most be stoped <br />Every days he killed a Civilian in north syria there is no PKk in syria and turkish gov and people is lien and said there is pkk there and YPG is PKk no you are not right and Kerdogan(donkey ) is  Fighting against Kurds every where and clearly said i will not allow kurds get his Right even in Mexico so ..so i Want said To our allies in USA and world wide stand with Kurds and i swear Edrogan will not be that person help your contry from isis attacks because (erdogan=isis)
Comment549	Turkey is not fighting against Kurds. Turkey is fighting against a terrorist organization named PKK. As a half Kurdish and half Turkish, I can say that there is no discrimination or fascism for Kurds in Turkey. Turkey is a modern, secular, democratic state.

Comment556	This operation looks a lot like the Deep State using the same playbook they did when they &quot;invited&quot; Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait, then used his invasion as a pretext to smash Saddam. If Turkey brutalizes and massacres the Kurds, Erdogan better watch out. Has the Pentagon just added the eighth nation to the hit list Gen. Wesley Clark revealed in 2011?
Comment557	when us fight the ISIS and us is causing murder but not the ISIS<br />now us is retreating and they are causing death because they don&#39;t join the war? what the hell?
Comment558	Protect the Kurds at all cost
Comment559	Fuck you Turkey
Comment560	Turkish assault on innocent Kurdish people <br />Wouldn&#39;t be without answer.
Comment561	Not a big fan of Donald Trump but in this case he&#39;s right, The Kurds are fighting for Land to have their own Independent State on The Turkey&#39;s border and are considered Terrorist that fought Turkey for 3 decades now in Turkey and The Kurds are Allies with The U.S. and Israel. Turkey don&#39;t want Terrorist and Zionist Israel Allies as their neighbors. I don&#39;t blame them

IF anything they shouldn‚Äôt have entrusted the Kurds to begin with given the fact that they are enemies with Turkey.
Comment574	bbc mike is alone there making big news ?
Comment575	Why is Turkey bombing the PKK/YPG in Syria?*<br /><br />The moderator must have made a mistake. I think the BBC, which is a reliable and objective news source, will not make such a mistake. I hope.
Comment 575.1	2016 Countries that control the center of the Earth, take control of the whole Earth. History says that. The US is intervening in the Middle East because it wants to exploit it too much. So all over the world, opposed to Turkey&#39;s operation. However, Turkey did not do anything wrong. Turkey was just trying to secure the border. This is one of the main reasons.
Comment 575.2	Mehmethan Polatoƒülu   Yes.  But we the US have done plenty it‚Äôs time to hand off.
Comment 575.3	2016 Isis is a problem for the whole world. After Turkey&#39;s operation, they fear the isis growth. Of course, it&#39;s just a justification but actual causes can be very different.
Comment 575.4	Not sure but for some reason 6000 miles away American gov cares.
Comment 575.5	Selamunaleykum they are boming the terrorist that killed 40thousand innocent people
Comment576	I&#39;m embarrassed as an American that we are abandoning the Kurds, who have bravely fought along side us for years.
Comment577	Kurds fighting against ISIS ? Cool story. That&#39;s why they were staging joint strikes against Syrian army in Deir-ez Zor area to capture oil field for their common lord U.S !
Comment578	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrxIvUTerXM&amp;t=0m56s"">0:56</a> and women! Don&#39;t forget the brave women fighting in the YPJ!"
Comment579	The ONLY reason Turkey is in NATO is so they would not ally with the Soviet Union. This still holds true today. If we kick Turkey out of the NATO, and hell they do NOT deserve to be our allies, then they will be open to pacts with Russia. So keeping them in NATO is the lesser of two evils. But someday there comes a line that Erdogan and his nationalistic loonies will cross. Also kicking Turkey out of the NATO means it will be in the same geostrategic situation as Germany during the late 19th and early 20th century, all their treaties might crumble eventually and Turkey will kick off a major war in the region and since it&#39;s not as powerful as the emerging alliances it will lose that war, just like Germany did two times in a row. So they&#39;re gonna fuck up the region and they&#39;re gonna get fucked up in the process. Unless the Turks realize what a megalomaniac Erdogan is, and that nationalism leads to defeat after a painful war for Turkey.
Comment580	Imagine turkey would arm and fund black militias in the USA..... that‚Äôs what the USA is doing in the Middle East.
Comment 580.1	The Kurds have been the main group of people living in the area that is called Kurdistan for over a thousand years. For some reason when the UN divided this region into separate countries they didn&#39;t create a homeland for the Kurds. They have a semi autonomous region in Iran and some self governance in Syria and and Iraq. In Turkey they can be bombed and genocided by the Turkish state at any time which Turkey has done for about a hundred years.
Comment 580.2	The Israelies are commanding America to go to World war on behalf of them and we do what ever the Chinese want. If we were to have a interest in no war the US and Japan would be making Pakistan the largest Japanese navel base ever known. . Zzz but we are not.
Comment 580.3	@Kevin Duggan is that why the US has military bases in South Korea and the southern Asian sea?
Comment 580.4	We must support native americans for their freedom. They are real americans.

Comment582	Bring the Last Suicide bomb to Turkey bring destruction to all Turk government
Comment583	Because they are a terrerist group.
Comment584	PKK that attacks Turkish Armed Forces for over 30 years is an officially recognized terrorist organization by USA. Don&#39;t let YPG, SDF and all the other letter combinations confuse you. Their source is PKK. For getting involved into the Syrian Crisis while everybody was having a slice of cake USA decided to use YPG to clean out the formerly created ISIS. It&#39;s like pouring honey on all over the floor in disguise and then hiring a cleaning company when all the bugs reached to your set goal of territory. By doing so and using an letter combinations of PKK, USA also overcame the official recognition towards PKK in the past. To make them cuter they&#39;ve even added a &quot;democratic&quot; title to SDF &quot;Syrian Democratic Forces&quot; . I mean seriously? Separatist Kurds and PKK are one of the extreme Marxist Communism followers. They use to &quot;establish&quot; their state and attack to Turkish Armed Forces by using guerrilla tactics like Cuban guerillas till majority of them moved to Syria from Turkish mountains to operate there with higher chances to gain control of area during a civil war. I mean they even call their martyrs or soldiers guerrilla. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s democracy here. Even if it happens and a state gets established for them. They&#39;ll not be independent in this anti-communist USA domained world. They&#39;ll be puppets of a corridor from Middle East to Mediterranean Sea just for oil.
Comment585	The Turks did nothing when isis invaded kobane  (A neighbouring city next to the border) and slaughtered thousands but as soon as Kurdish ypg solders occupied the area turkey starts an invasion and calling it national security... How does that make sense, isis solders on the border = not terrorist Kurdish solders on the border = terrorist <br /><br />Fuck erdogan the isis supporter
Comment586	Erdogan is a ISIS supporter...

Comment594	The correct title should be &quot;Why is Turkey bombarbading the YPG in Syria?&quot; The YPG does not represent the Kurdish people, being the filthy commies they are.
Comment595	Turkey does not kill Kurds.Turkey is killing the terrorists.Turkey just wants to ensure the security of their country.Many Turkish citizens have died because of these terrorists for years.Bombings, killing soldiers,policemen killed teachers providing training to eastern Turkey.And after this operation began, and in previous years the bomb to a lot of our citizens living in the city on the border with Turkey was discarded. Many of our citizens died.The other day a 9-month-old baby died because of a bomb thrown by terrorists.Why don&#39;t you report them? Turkey&#39;s own country, you have a right to protect its citizens, such as why do not you tell?Where are our dead people?Our greatest right to protect our country.Your problem is not humanity.
Comment596	Isis is a finished group. Don&#39;t give that as an excuse. The problem is the aim of separating turkey and creating new state here which you dream too. But it won&#39;t come true. Stop reinforcing the terrorist groups.
Comment597	How is this guy a reporter? Can hardly understand him through his Speech impediment

Comment598	Turkey is scum...I hope TRUMP Destroys u
Comment599	Look out for kurdish area map in the begining of the video. Operation area is totaly different. This means ypg invaded that area. And now turkey giving the lands to their real owners.
Comment600	if you love refugees so much, why not take them to your country,European politics is so hypocritical and know that there will never be a country called kurdistan. we could kill thousands of terrorists for this.come on, send more weapons kurd allies. this is just the beginning!!!

Comment602	Burada anlatƒ±lanlarƒ± T√ºrk√ße anlatacak babayiƒüit yok mu ne diyor bu BBC hakkƒ±mƒ±zda √ßevirmeye √ßalƒ±≈üƒ±yorum ama fazla yapamƒ±yorum
Comment603	performing this operation for Turkey to solve the refugee crisis in the country and bring real peace to the region from Europe and the United States overseeing their interests here is not compromise on this issue and we need to limit our solution
Comment604	Turkey offered Us to remove ƒ∞sis by themlsevles but Usa used pkk and feed them . now they want land ??? and take it from Turkey ?? only Us is clever up to Americans :)
Comment605	Why usa killed blacks!!
Comment606	If people are so concerned about America &quot;abandoning&quot; the Kurds, there&#39;s an easy solution. Two, actually.<br />One is go and help them fight yourself, just like thousands have.<br />Two is send in European, or Muslim troops to assist. <br />There, solved it for you. <br />As hard as that decision is to swallow, why does America HAVE to defend them?
Comment607	because turkey is bombing bombing pyd, pkk, sdf. all of them are same terrorist group. stop manipulation

Comment610	fake news.. Turkey not attack to kurdish, Turkey attack to terrorist organization pkk-pyd, from kurds, turks, english, germans and other a lot of country&#39;s people, sorry not people, terrorists...
Comment611	To some kurdish who think that USA betrayed them, USA betrayed nobody, they had a mission and now it finished. So,  the only people who you should blame on are your leaders who betrayed you and now they have got millions of dollars in their accounts and laughing at YPK/PKK militias.
Comment612	I wonder if the Kurds would succeed in conquering or partially occupying T√ºrkey. These people have fought against ISIS, and now they are not getting any backing from the people who did not want to fight ground forces with their own people. I hate Turks for this back stab
Comment 612.1	@Adil but with a B<br /><br />And before I forget it: There are countries in Europe that have taken in refugees, as we Swiss. We give those who seek help, work and a roof over their heads. So that they can live in Peace. We integrate refugees, not as in Germany or elsewhere. So keep this in mind when you think you can threaten with helpless refugees. That alone shows what you Turks have for a character. A really dirty dishonorable.
Comment 612.2	@Adil but with a B I am from Switzerland and my neighbors are 2 families from Afghanistan who have fled. Well, I do not know what you&#39;re thinking, but I think you Turks are just looking for a legitimate reason to slaughter Kurds. <br />Do not forget: the Kurds are sitting on a bunch of IS fighters. Ask yourself what happens when they come free again. Fraternize with the Kurds? Personally, I doubt that, but man sometimes makes weird decisions. The enemy of my enemy
Comment 612.3	&quot;Back stab&quot;? No one is going to succeed in occupying Turkey, that is what they&#39;ve been trying to do for years in their so called political party, or terrorist organization called PKK. We did not back stab them, we did not attack them just because the U.S protected them. Trump turned on their backs, that is solely the reason that Turkey is freely attacking Kurdish opposition forces. We literally waste our resources so that you don&#39;t have to deal with mass numbers of refugees, and launch this military operation so that we can settle some of them, instead of literally letting them roam around illegally, without even having official records. The reason you, my german guy, don&#39;t see Syrians around your country everywhere you look, is because we give them a place to stay. We&#39;ll continue to give them a place to stay after cleaning the so-called &quot;Kurdish freedom fighters&quot;.
Comment613	Can Britain carry about 4million refugees???????? <br />ISS or Ypg are the same üí©<br />Syria for all not just kurd . Don‚Äôt say that ‚Äúthey frighted ISS‚Äù because even-though they will still terrorists . They want found country On an ethnic basis
Comment614	It is over 80 years that Kurds are killing Turks. They must stop killing Turks.<br />Kurds just saved their own a ..s they did not help any Syrians.
Comment615	KURDS OF SYRIA ARE THE REFUGEES IN TURKEY. TR IS BOMBING THE PKK. YPG/PKK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ALLY OF THE US AND ENGLAND. Good luck folks.
Comment616	This has made the EU look really stupid as they have handed over ‚Ç¨4.5 Billion to Turkey to control refugees and pay an annual bill of ‚Ç¨740 Million. How foolish can the EU be but they don‚Äôt care as it is the Taxpayer that pays the bill.<br />P.S. The British Taxpayer pays the largest amount of the bill proving that Remoaners are the silliest people in the world.
Comment617	For everyone wondering: Trump is good with Kurds in Kurdistan but he told Turkey to kill all the Kurds in Syria. Even tho, the Kurds fought isis for the whole world America has betrayed the Syrian Kurds. Kurds have done nothing wrong to Arabs, Iranians, and Turks and other middle easterns. All they are doing is fighting for their city to become a country of its own and separated form Iraq. But somehow none of the others will allow it and they hate us Kurds for no reason at all.
Comment618	They are not kurdish They Fuckin terrorist They kill baby bbc you suck lier
Comment619	Turks do not attack kurds, Turkey attacking pkk. The reason is only To protect the innocent and the country

Comment634	This happens when you betray your own country. Kurds were living in<br />peace in Syria, Iraq and Iran before deciding to revolt against the people of the country they were living in and fight against the homeland. Another Ottoman Genocide starting.
Comment 634.1	Then why is turkey stepping in if that&#39;s the case? I&#39;m pretty sure they actually left because the leader of that country was brainfucked. They only think about money and oil, money and oil...

Comment 643.1	@A Hans yes I understand ... believe me I hate wars , conflicts. I just wish we all got along.
Comment 643.2	They (YPG/PKK terrorists) should have thought that first. They killed ~ 40.000 innocent Turkish citizens in last 40 years. And now, the same countries that supported them are declaring Turkey the offender. Bullshit.
Comment 643.3	yes peace with neighbour and then give weapons in tons to terrorists and call them freedom fighters and when the purpose is over call them terrorists ... this is the way of western democracy .... we have seen it in vietnam, afghanistan, libya, syria, mali .... no mfs from west shows that almost all so called terrorists, drug cartels, insurgents, rebels use weapons supplied and MANUFACTURED by West .... all the white intellectuals know who starts the fire and then plays the fireman .... the fault lies with muslims though ... they do not read parables of esop .... or implement Islamic values in their lives ......

Comment647	Turkey wants to expand its border, simple as. The UN has always been utterly useless so don&#39;t expect any help there and NATO are under the influence of Washington who have thrown the Kurds under a bus, the Kurds who gave their all in the fight against the globalist financed ISIS. Disgusting! Americans should hang their heads in shame at this and remember what the Turks did to the Armenians. Blood once again will be on many hands, yet all we have are protesters from the middle class going on about climate change and an argument about Brexit. How the West was lost indeed.

Comment 684.1	You are correct. The US initially regarded both the 1st and the 2nd world wars as another man&#39;s war and ones they shouldn&#39;t become embroiled in. It was only after Churchill engineered the sinking of the Lusitania did the US involve themselves in the global conflict.

Comment715	Dear BBC the point you didn&#39;t understand here they are(pkk, ypg etc.) killing soldiers and civil people in Turkey. And Turkey as a rightfully defending the borders with Syria because in case if the war spread into the country believe me many people will lose their lifes so Turkey has the right for defence also they (pkk, ypg etc.) doesn&#39;t have a right to build their own country in Turkey&#39;s territory or in Syria because the Kurdish  people in Turley are pleasure to live in Turkey without any other seperate land. Also Syrian people wants their own country back and they are fighting for that(free Syrian army) and Turkey helping them to get back their country back so they can go and settle there safely. The point is here why USA and Trump getting involved all of this issues because as all of us knows USA is not neighboor nor Turkey or Syria so it shouldn&#39;t be a problem for USA. I believe firstly you should focus on that???

Comment736	More like. &quot;Why are Kurds squatting on everyone&#39;s land&quot;? Then calling it theirs
Comment737	Turkey is not bombing Kurds . Kurds side with Turkey . YPG is a babykiller terrorist organization .
Comment738	FUCK TURCKISH
Comment739	The greates size nation in the world without a land. Barbaric Nato member is massacring a peaceful people and Europe is silent because they are not palestinians. What a disgrace. Erdugan the dictator is threating EU to send them refugee, and that&#39;s enouth for Europe to let him enter another country and kill people that helped the west and the US and destroid ISIS. If I was a Jurd, I would free now all ISIS from their prison. Trump has betray the Kurds in the must ugly way. This would have a great influence against US interest all over the region. I&#39;m really disgust. Give the Kurds their own safe land already!

Comment742	Turkey and USA wtf. pos
Comment743	Just leave those people to live in peace
Comment 743.1	While they&#39;ve been killing us, kidnapping us, detonating explosives in the city centers and trying to establish a country forcibly on where belong to all of us for over a 30 years?
Comment744	What a stupid question!
Comment745	Everyone wants us to defend our Kurdish Allies, by attacking our Turkish allies. Our hands are tied
Comment 745.1	@venbolo 3- Ofcourse it is relevant. In my country we have a huge turkish community and most of them are erodogan followers that want to destroy us. They openly admit it. You have no clue what you are talking about. <br /><br />We only do trade with turkey and that is it. My tries to appease the turks, but I don&#39;t see the point. The turks don&#39;t like us at all.<br />And I wasn&#39;t suggesting americans should send forces. I think europe should do something for once. But they won&#39;t.<br /><br /><br />Erdogan is using these millitant rebels to kill syrian kurds and assad is sending troops now. What do you think is going on there?
Comment 745.2	@Ahmet Karakaya, Sure, it&#39;s about the terrorists pkk and sdf. That&#39;s why your precious leader is killing civilians. Just stop it man. In a speech a few years back and you can find it here on yt, erodogan announced his intentions  for the middle east and syria. It is not a big secret.
Comment 745.3	@Zarion 11 yea, sure dude.. Turkey &quot;is not&quot; a real ally but a marxist-militant group is. Of course.. <br />Just ask yourself why the 4-5m refugees in Turkey/Europe&#39;s camps don&#39;t consider returning home. Most of the refugees in Turkey come from North/Norteast of Syria because of the close distance to the Turkish border. So, the PYD (your Congress even considered them as a PKK affiliate) territory must be very safe und a good place to live, or not? <br />Its not about Kurds, its about the organisation called PYD/PKK/SDF or whatever. There are 1m Kurdish refugees in Turkey, and a lot more in Europe. When the US was in war with the taliban.. it wasn&#39;t in war with the Afghans. Its so frustrating to read this bs from our ally.
Comment 745.4	@Zarion 11 1- Turkey isn&#39;t a dictatorship. It is true that its democracy got weakened a lot in last 15 years but it is still not a dictatorship by any measure. Erdogan lost the munincipalities of all major cities in the last election.<br />2- Erdogans only interest is staying in power. With the exception of a couple of small far-right groups no one wants to revive Ottoman Empire. Even the nationalists are more about uniting all Turkic countries by diplomacy.<br />3- Yes Turkey is a Muslim majority country. Does that even relevant to the topic?<br />4- Turkey isn&#39;t a country that can be conquered easily. Think of Vietnam War and  multiple it by at least 10. We have the second largest army of NATO and the equipment is 70% Turkish made. No modern western society have the mentality to endure such a bloody war.
Comment 745.5	But the Turks are not really our allies. I mean, they are a Nato member, but they are also a muslim nation, ruled by a dictator. This guy want to restore the great ottoman empire. He is not going to stop.<br />I don&#39;t understand. Nobody seems to have any morals anymore. We just stand idle and watch another genocide. It will bite you in the face one day.

Comment 747.3	where is your state
Comment748	Genocide again. üíÄ
Comment 748.1	@Ar Men Ia Read what your solders did to civilian Turks on Cyprus man... They killed innocent woman and kids in the bathroom, did you see the pictures of those genocided family? You did that. So, we came and stopped genocides in Cyprus, you couldn&#39;t kill any Turk after that, we brought peace there... Also, we know how many civil Turks were killed by Greek solders on west Turkey and we will never forget them. You live with the lies of your grandparents just like Armenians. Because of you are Christian, other Christian countries don&#39;t blame you, but one day this system will change. <br />Don&#39;t lie, infact Greeks and Armenians are the real genociders, there are a lot of proofs. The God will never be with you with your dirty hands.
Comment 748.2	@Bora G√ºcl√º think of Cypriot genocide in 1974, instead of talking about us. Terrorist pigs.
Comment 748.3	Which genocide? Armenians genocided Azerbaican people? <br />Genocide means, if armed forces kill unweponized innocent men, women, kids and elders. Can you see those people today in North of Syria? of course NO. There are ONLY men, fully armed by USA... so, how come you say it is genocide? Take a look at dictionary again to meaning of GENOCIDE my Scadinavian friend. <br />Also, remember what Wikings did in The UK people in the past. That one was genecide...
Comment749	Kurds ought to surrender to Erdogan, and the leaders should flee to Europe. Naughty Nod knows no bitterness! While we‚Äôre at it, Ghana should concede to the United States. Why not? They‚Äôre welcome here, and they‚Äôre certainly free to help us fight our enemies.<br /><br />I guard against righteousness. I guard against Noddiness. Now, if only we could get rid of Jews, buttsex, and witches.
Comment750	because they deserve it
Comment751	Peace comes when middle East people change their religion.. Islam is Evil religion of the world..
Comment 751.1	complexfilms then suck prophet pedophilic Mohamad dick and die like pig...if middle East people accept Christianity/Buddhism/Judaism/Hinduism/Sikhism then I will give you 100% guarantee there is no more violence..
Comment 751.2	you are the real problem, this has nothing to do with religion, it&#39;s purely a political mess started by murica which is a secular state
Comment752	"Repost:<br /><br /><br />  YOU in the WEST(particularly USA) created this mess in our BACKYARD. Now you either<br /><br />1- Clean it up all by yourselves<br />2- Take ALL those refugees in YOUR soil (We are NOT your garbage yard and enough is enough! )<br />3- or just STFU and stop whining like the softboys you are and let us do the cleaning for ourselves."
Comment753	Are they Kurds or mercenaries doing thy bidding for USA? Syria will be over soon so where next? Iraq is done, Afghanistan is done, Libya is certainly done while Iran is still waiting for its turn.
Comment754	Turkey gives training, money and arms to IS terrorists. Turkey is behind IS terror.
Comment755	Freedom to kurdistan!! From Greece with love! Everyone has betrayed you and yet you fight evil. It wont be long that your sacrifices will have a result to the people of these world
Comment 755.1	@Mav an <br />I&#39;m not even Turkish mate<br />Do everyone a favour and stfu, go fix your crippled economy, dumass, instead of leeching off the EU and criticising other&#39;s government go fix yours first, you are at the verge of recession<br />Kurds are our brothers and so are Turks, we want peace there not another broken state
Comment 755.2	@complexfilms it would be nice to create Kurdystan inside Turkey. US will provide that.
Comment 755.3	@Mav an My friend, you shown your side by saying you hate Turks. It means, nobody can believe in and trust to your lies from now on. You cannot be neutral on Syria issue. Stop lying...üò°üò°üò°
Comment 755.4	@Bora G√ºcl√º Yes you are and always be our enemies. We hate you with all our heart. A disgusting nation that has nothing to be proud of. Only wars, genocides and cunningness. You only want to take others nations lands. But that aint gonna happen. A storm is coy soon for you
Comment 755.5	@Bora G√ºcl√º yes I really love RKK.And you are the ones who invaded to Syria just for &quot;peace&quot;. You call that peace I call that invasion, a chance to take part of Syria. The whole world is watching what you do. And Erdogan along with Turkey will have a tragic future. You dreamers of an othoman empire will, will end up losing everything, a karma, for your greediness and genocides.
Comment756	Next video why america kill turk
Comment757	All this dislike toward Muslim is because of a small thing. IT IS THE  Burka and wearing a hibjob. It seams to be small and meaningless but it is an eye sore. It describes to western thinking people as a stubbornness a disrespect to our culture. If they really want to assimilate don,t act as if you are special to rattle us with your unsightly looking close. A sign that Allah is dictating that ugliness. It makes people  angry and here is the dislike. They have no respect and so do we. All America wants is to expel something that makes us gag and furious. In short we where better of with out Muslim in our mids. They look like none meanig bats.  The sooner we the free world send you home the better we are of. You bother us the same way as if we go to Mekka wearing a mini skirt.
Comment758	They wont be fighting isis they&#39;ll be fighting the turkish military huh? Turkey is worlds eightest powerful country we can finish the ƒ∞sis and finish the all terrorists. But America and Eu dont want this because pkk aid them to achieve the petrol easily. We are fighting for peace, maybe you cant understand this.
Comment759	Trump and that author are full of shit. The SDF helped us fight ISIS. They didn&#39;t exist yet in ww2. <br />They are fighting for democracy in the middle east for christ sake. <br />They hold ceremonies with American flags.

So why doesn&#39;t the bombs fall on our civilian settlements by Syria? Why bbc does not see? TURKISH CIVILIANS ARE DYING HERE! Two faced bbc
Comment767	What the hell is that mean they didn&#39;t help us in Normandy the turkey it was Germany&#39;s Ally in the time you remember mr. President
Comment 767.1	Turkey was not in war at beginning and they later declared a war against Nazis. Turkey also received many hundred thousands Christian and Jewish refugees from Europe during 2. World War.
Comment768	Here comes the turks with anal stinging, go kurds, the nationalist turks are just a bunch of retarded people that think they are the ottoman empire, but is just a erdogan move to try to stay in power.
Comment769	NATO Europe just has No agenda for THE Kurdish People! I have not heard One single Word from Bulgaria on their views of Erdogans attack. NATO Europe are just an illusion. Non Eurpean leader what so ever has told Europe IF Erdogan &amp; NATO are right or wrong. It seems they lack communication. Not One single Polish citizan has joined Erdogan under THE banner of NATO Europe. Boris Johnson are occupied with Sauna club laws in Liverpool.
Comment770	Clearly the word terrorist is mean Erdogan.
Comment771	Because terrorist Erdogan is the caliph of the caliphate and he realized after Kurds demolished ISIS he wants to rebuild them in order to threaten Europe by letting refugees to fleet to Europe but basically he fleeting ISIS not refuges. Turkey is ISIS and ISIS is Turkey period.
Comment772	Why is Turkey bombing the Kurds in Syria? Turks hate Kurds by nature .
Comment773	Bias reporting here. Blame the USA.  Yet for years people been wanting them out. now they leave and you call it betrayal you people are never happy!

Comment803	"Turkey is not bombing the Kurds . Kurds are the major citizens and brothers of Turks in Turkey. Turkey is fighting against terrorist groups YPG-YPJ-PKK-DAESH that are supported, financed and armed by emperyalist powers like USA, backed by EU, Zionists, the big Israel dreamers, evangelists etc. Turkey has been hosting millions of refugees and spending billions of dollars for many years. The international Press like BBC is making black propaganda and distorting the reality and facts."

Comment808	British politics is always a hypocrite and a liar. A perception is being created as if Kurdish terrorists are the representative of all Kurds.Kurds are one of the basic societies of Turkey and are equal citizens in all areas. The United States and Western colonists seeking to loot Middle Eastern oil,and Israel seeking to establish a controlled puppet state in the Middle East, set their own scenarios.Turkey will never allow these frauds.Because this is Turkey&#39;s life and death war.<br />The Turkish homeland is under threat.This threat comes from the pkk/pyd and isis, founded by the US/Israel and Western colonists.The United States has sent thousands of trucks, ammunition and logistical support to these terrorist Coyotes.Trump calls these terrorists &quot;our allies&quot; I thought he was an ally of Turkey in NATO. Turkey has killed nearly 3 thousand so-called Muslim isis bandits in Syria and its territory.What did the US and the Western coalition do? With saying that Turkey is helping isis, they made propaganda full of lies and slander. They know that Turkey is the strongest country to resist the exploitation of the Middle East...They think they will intimidate Turkey with lies,slander ,black propaganda and sanctions...Civilian Kurds have never been  targeted  by Turkey . it is no coincidence that there are terrorists from many countries in the pkk/pyd and isis .Are these sold-out terrorists, representative of the Kurds? <br />CNN is trying to engage in counterproductive perception and black propaganda.<br />They&#39;re not gonna make it! <br />Turkey defends its homeland and the Turkish people who contains many ethnic group..<br />Republic of Turkey  and Turkish people will not condone the looting of oil regions and the insidious Israeli expansion.<br />Turkey will fight to the last drop of blood it has against the US/Israel and Western colonists and their puppet terrorists who want to segment their homeland .<br />The Turkish military will cut the roots out U.S./Israeli and Western-backed terrorists in Syria and hand over Syria to the Syrians.

Comment813	Turkey is an intruder country, killing dozens of civilians and innocent babies. They just did so to consolidate the ruling party&#39;s (AKP) power and to win next elections, which may take place earlier than its due. People in Turkey were talking about AKP&#39;s corruption, economic crisis and Turkish lira hit against the dollar before this intrusion so they needed an imaginative enemy and to direct the public&#39;s hatred to so-called  &quot;outside forces&#39; here. However, there is also strong propaganda carried out by pro-government media outlets (almost all of them) presenting deceptive news all the time to make poor people believe that a Turkey, as a descendant of a great Ottoman Empire, will win all kind of war no matter of what.  Turkish citizens are really obsessive about &quot;nationalism&quot; and &quot;religion&quot;, which they think of themselves as a defender of &#39;Islam and caliphate&#39;, which directly correspondences with ISIS&#39;s aim in the region which is also why Turkey is supporting them. It is not much known, but joining rates to ISIS have so much among Turks. Like magnetic attraction, it seems the Turkish government is really keen to save ISIS cells in the region and release them to exploit their shadowy purposes. Dictator Erdogan, before the deep in debt and huge devastation, is playing his biggest gamble

Comment819	I can clearly see that european media supports ypg for europe&#39;s benefits, since europe buys cheap petrol from ypg. Your hands are bloody, europe. You are supporting terrorist for monetary benefits and keep telling human rights. Nice theather, keep playing it.
Comment 819.1	@Tan Yƒ±ldƒ±zƒ± Buying cheap doesn&#39;t mean selling cheap, that different is what You call the profit, HUH?<br />And is known thst oil from Iran under sanctions is exported to Turkey, the Iranians need this export desperstely so it shouldn&#39;t be expensive.<br />Oil in Turkey should be cheap, but the profit margins or the taxes or even both must be very high.<br />But perhaps You are nit so much in  economy...
Comment 819.2	@Brek Malotta all them is a lie if it s true why petrol so expensive in turkey? Huh?
Comment 819.3	@Cyka Blyad<br /> ¬†In2016¬†WikiLeaks¬†published more than 57,000 emails from 2010 to 2016 reportedly obtained by the¬†hacktivist¬†group¬†Redhack¬†that linked ISIL with Turkey&#39;s Minister of Oil¬†Berat Albayrak,¬†Tayyip Erdogan&#39;s son-in-law, by allegedly &quot;proving his connection to ISIS operation smuggling oil into Turkey,&quot; even years after Turkey banned most oil imports from ISIL.<br /><br />In March 2016, an RT documentary presented documents left by retreating ISIL operatives and witness reports that also suggested a link between ISIL&#39;s oil production and support by Turkey that, in turn, was benefiting from cheap oil.

Comment865	Tihis heppened it kurd dont forget
Comment866	It was the US who promised the Kurds their independent state inside Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran, in return for their help taking down Saddam Hussein back in the 90&#39;s. Remember that scandalous map of so called &quot;Kurdistan&quot; revealed in a NATO briefing in front of Turkish officers? Yes, that&#39;s what the US promised to Kurds but none of those countries will give it to them without a fight and as sovereign countries it&#39;s their right to defend their soil at any cost.<br /><br />By the way, the US didn&#39;t just make an empty promise, they financed, trained, armed and protected the Kurds as long as they had a use for them in Iraq and in Syria. In fact some of the Kurdish forces occupying the area in Syria right now moved there from Iraq, which is a country where the Kurds already attempted to declare their independence in the 2017 referendum, which naturally was not recognized by the official government of Iraq. They now occupy a significant piece of Syrian soil which doesn&#39;t belong to them, hoping to hold on to at least some of it after the dust has settled, so that they can pursue their dream of independent Kurdistan, promised by the US.

Comment935	*Saudi killing people in Yemen<br />*Turkey killing Kurds  in Syria<br />*Pakistan killing people in Baluchistan<br />*China killing Uyghur  people in China<br />*China killing people in honkong<br />But all are worried about disconnection of INTERNET in KASHMIRüòÇ
Comment936	Wow what a coke sucker
Comment937	If kurds are fighting for their land then<br /> talibans aka terrorists are fighting for the same reason why are they lebelled as terrorists.
Comment938	Western hypocrisy at it&#39;s best
Comment939	Why are you lying? We&#39;re not bombing them&#39; We&#39;re just bombing terrorists. I love Turkey ‚ù§Ô∏è —è –ª—é–±–ª—é —Ç–µ–±—è –¢—É—Ä—Ü–∏—è

Comment941	If Israelis soldier shoot many people all world quiet why???
Comment942	So Turkey is helping ISIS again
Comment943	Go Turkey
Comment944	I really really wonder something that how would you describe a terrorist ? We have no any problem with Kurdish people, i have been in Turkish army with Kurdish and i still keep in touch with my Kurdish brothers. Lot of them greath people. But if they attemt to establishing a state of Kurdish in Turkish Lands by killing children and civilians what you would do i really wonder ? Please and please  guys! read the PKK chronolgy records in Turkey, then see what kinda terror activities they have been. Think about that there are a lot Kurdish people in UK as well, in one day if they attempt to establish a state of Kurdish by killing civilians would you let them do what they want ?  <br /><br />There is no other way to reach peace in the world without war somethimes. As a Turkish i&#39;m really sorry that we seriously bothering Syrian civilians in Syria but we must create a safe zone in Syria and along Turkish and Syrian borderline to send back 3.6 millions of Syrians. They are welcomed in our coulntry for years even though they damaging employment of manpower market and economy in Turkey.<br /><br />So please change your video title to PKK/YPG instead Kurdish cuz it sounds RACIST !<br /><br />Hope you guys understanding us. Many thanks for readers.

Comment 947.1	Kurd=Terrorist
Comment948	Support the Kurds! turkey terrorist!
Comment949	Usa killed so many people in Iraq in the name of &#39;ISIS&#39;. You guys said nothing. We are protecting our and mƒ±stly syrian  people and suddenly you guys are expert at humanity?? I had to laugh. No one can dream a  land somewhere and kill thousand people just to live wherever they want. But this is what PKK wants and doing. People are dying at this point but syrian people were already dying Because of pkk/ypg the terrorist themselves. Turkey is protecting not only them themselves too. You dont need to show mercy to baby killers.
Comment950	they may become a state yet
Comment951	Turkish-Backed Syrian army has more than 5000 kurdish fighter. What about that?  Also more than 10 million Kurd lives Turkey   if we want to kill kurds we start to kill kurds in Turkey
Comment952	Correction it is not Kurds but the American funded terrorist organisations called PKK, YPG and PYD. These are not Kurds.<br />If you delete my comment then shame on you hypocrites!
Comment953	Kurds have bought it upon themselves.<br />You reap what you saw.
Comment954	I recommend Kurds to negotiate with Turkey.
Comment 954.1	In Turkey they dont allow kurds to speak their mother tongue even in places of prayer.. why doesn&#39;t allah now kurdish?
Comment 954.2	Ro Ne right so your telling me that Turkey , a Muslim country, told people in Mosques to kill kurds? We aren‚Äôt going against the kurds we are going against terrorists ( not kurds )
Comment 954.3	Hasan Mohammad ziaul islam  Kurds did that many times but Turkey broke their promises and don‚Äôt give them their rights , in their mosques they advice everyone to kill Kurds ,even so many innocent children died in this operation , they all do that under the name of Islam but we are pretty sure that real muslims will not do that , they are just fake muslims

Comment958	So Trump only helps countries, that participated in d-day. That is clearly wrong
Comment959	Obviously Erdogan sees no trouble with genocide either, as he has convinced Trump into helping him commit it against the Kurds in Syria. Did he offer Trump some sweet financial deals or just promises to let his &quot;many financial enterprises in Turkey&quot; continue to rake in money if  Trump would only let him march a lot of mercenaries into Syria to help him slaughter the Kurds there and steal the land for themselves.<br />Who has the transcript of THAT phone call, I wonder; and when will we ever see it?

Comment 960.3	The Joker why would we destroy Syria and then let them into our country?

Comment 961.2	@legend 4 life If USA stood with Kurds, Erdogan wouldn&#39;t even think about attacking Kurds

Comment968	The true enemy
Comment969	eu, us, nato etc officially recognised pkk as a terrorist group. not only turkey. they do suicide attacks and kill civilians same with the isis but sell themselves as a cute freedom fighters. kurds have different political views and turkey does not have any problem with most of the kurds. these are ultra nationalist, fascist ones.
Comment970	"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TurkeyISNotAlone"">#TurkeyISNotAlone</a> Pakistan stand with Turkey"
Comment971	Trump is false man
Comment972	"(1) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrxIvUTerXM&amp;t=0m20s"">0:20</a>; a map shows north Syria detailing Kurdish forces, Syrian government etc. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrxIvUTerXM&amp;t=0m36s"">0:36</a>; a map of Kurd population shown. If you superpose these two maps, you can clearly see the issue developed by USA in the region using YPG.<br />(2) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrxIvUTerXM&amp;t=0m35s"">0:35</a>; population of Kurds is given as 30 million. If we take this number as the reference (Kurd population in that region shall be more than that), more than 60 % of the Kurd population are Turkiye Citizen. Kurd population at Syria is around 2 million. So even with the presupposition; ‚ÄúYPG is representing Kurds in Syria‚Äù (which is highly disputable), claiming that this group (which is described as Terrorist by most of the international organizations and USA as well) which covers less than 7 % of the Kurd population is protecting rights of Kurds against Turkiye, home of 60 % of the Kurd population, is not rational.  <br />(3) YPG is a Kurdish group; however, it definitely does not mean neither all Kurds are supporting this group nor YPG is representing Kurds. According to a survey conducted by A&amp;G in Turkiye where more than 60 % of the Kurd population live, only 19.9 % think PKK represents Kurds &amp; 63.4 % consider YPG as a threat. One can have any personal perspective about this issue, however; shall distinguish a terrorist group from Kurds.<br />(4) Some of the BILGESAM survey company results in Turkey; 9.9 % of Kurds in Turkiye want independence, 83.9 % want a ‚Äúfuture together with Turks‚Äù, 81 % consider Turkiye Army as their army.  <br />Consequently, this news is biased and contains many misinformation."
Comment 972.1	Aƒüzƒ±na saƒülƒ±k
Comment973	News is mentioning that majority of the Kurds are in Turkey, yet comment as Turkish army bombing Kurds. But not mentioning those fighters gathered in Turkish border, are actually linked to PKK which is accepted as terrorist by everyone. Please be honest and make news rather than comment.
Comment974	Pakistan support turkey

Comment977	Because Turkey is coward. Simple.
Comment 977.1	Cowards? Theyre not the ones hiding in the mountains dude..
Comment978	Clearly the word &quot;Terrorist&quot; is meaningless..
Comment 978.1	@White Nights You can apply the word to nearly any army involved in a conflict, USA forces have killed 10,000&#39;s of civilians  in the Middle East over the last few decades. You can argue collateral damage, but if you go and speak to to those families they may not be so kind. Its all about perspective.
Comment 978.2	@Light Seeker terrorist = people who kill unarmed civilians. YPG (which the west refers as Kurds) does that. That&#39;s why they are terrorists. They killed a 10 month old baby 2 days ago and yet Turkey is guilty. That&#39;s called black propaganda and it&#39;s working perfectly.
Comment 978.3	Battleneter this is happening thx to the stupidity of the Americans governments and how they corrupted what the term terror really means. Now everyone calling their enemies as terrorists. Dictatorships are calling protestors as terrorists! Imagine! How ironic and weird the world we are living in?
Comment979	Everything clear America play on many sides üëé<br />Who said down with America I think he said the truth 100%
Comment980	Turkey in NOT bombing her Kurd siblings. Turkey is not killing good Kurds or peoples. TURKEY IS BOMBING TERRORIST OF PKK, PYD-YPG. You are making lie news perfectly. TURKEY IS NOT BABY KILLER LIKE PKK. TURKEY IS NOT WANT TO WAR IN SYRIA. TURKEY IS NOT LIKE USA.

It originally denoted a barrier implemented to stop the spread of infectious diseases.&quot; Wikipedia<br /><br />Kurds, to the Turks, may cause death.
Comment992	It is easy to talk about middle east for western countries such as america and france which are thousand miles away from the shithole, if you put yourself in the place of Turkey like imagine having a border to Iran, syria and imagine if you get in a car and drive for 20 km you will see people are shooting, bombing eachother. That got you anxious right ? Ofcourse Turkey is going to create a safe zone against terrorist kurd forces which are constantly ambushing, killing innocent people, newcomer soldiers babies, teachers and kids...<br /><br />And all those lies that western media creates shows that this operation was a must and that operation means Turkey is 100% independent and always will do what it takes to save itself from this middle east shithole.

Comment996	USA promised them a country of their own to make them fight for their cause. This country has to be created on another country&#39;s territory. What kind of country would agree to give their land? Do you think Assad would give land to them? Or Iran or Turkey? Don&#39;t give impossible promises to them from the start.  No country would agree to this and it causes bloodshed with no gain.(except the usa) That&#39;s American politics for you.

Comment 999.3	They must of changed drastically since the time they parked their tanks at the border, and then watched as Isis marched to Kobani.

Comment 999.4	@Rinnzu Rosendale The displacement was done years ago via isis and ypg . What was the Kurdish population in Syria before isis and what is now? Even after the displacement of Arabs, Turks, Assyrians etc, and placing kurds at their land, kurds are a real minority there. Now, the displaced people will come back to their homeland.
Comment 999.5	@Rinnzu Rosendale If you served in the army, you should know. But if you lived in Turkey, you would know best.
Comment1000	I don‚Äôt understand why the west find it normal to finance and provide a group of people with weapons to fight the rest of the population.

And of course they always wanted Syria to be full and only of arabs.They had  split Kurdistan in 4 and the kurds have been fighting for their rights . My parents and even my  grand grand parents were born there but the Syrian government never acknowledged them as Syrians until 2011( a year before war) .They didn&#39;t even had passports  or so. So basically They were like Outlanders in their own country. And after 8 years of  war  , where everyone thought its abit better . Maybe . Finally rest and freedom . Erdogan is now doing shit .

Comment1031	Viva Kurdistan!!!  The more Turkey bombs the Kurds, the more the world will be determined in helping the formation of Kurdistan.  In five years from now there will be Kurdistan just like Haifa was freed from Turkey during the First World War.
Comment 1031.1	The Kurds don&#39;t need their own ethno-state, they should at least have autonomous regions in Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria.
Comment1032	ISIS prisoners have all escaped. So Turkey is attacking what they perceive as terrorists only to help ISIS criminals to escape to fight another day and commit horrific crimes. I have nothing against Turkey but this makes no sense at all.
Comment1033	To clarify the situation, think of IRA and add it some 30000 killing including babies, childs and unarmed civilians, illegal drug trade, kidnapping and many more. That&#39;s what PKK is, and no one can associate all Kurdish people with those groups. So the title must be &quot;bombing PKK/YPG/SDF forces&quot;. Also with this safe zone Syrian people will be able return Syria.

Comment 1041.4	I wonder who believes turkish lies instead of themself
Comment 1041.5	Ro Ne shortly, from Ottoman Empire till now Turks are racist towards everyone. Last year a Kurd held a small Kurdistan flag, and they kicked him. <br />Kurds in Turkey are bot even allowed to have their freedom and speak or write in Kurdish. To say, there are some good Turkish people but very little amount compare to the racist ones.

Please get your head out of the Marvel and DC universe. And see the facts. They are same.

Comment1081	"Turkey is not attacking Kurds. There are about 15 million (maybe more) Kurds in Turkey. If Turkey was attacking Kurds, Turkey had to attack all of Kurds within Turkey&#39;s borders. But Turkey is not attacking them because Kurds are civilians of Turkey. Also I am from Turkey and I have Kurd neighbors and we are supporting, loving each other without thinking which race we are from.<br /><br />Turkey is attacking PKK/YPG because they&#39;ve been doing so much harm to Turkey for years. They&#39;ve been doing terror attacks, attacking to civilians of Turkey... Also they killed civilians in ≈ûanlƒ±urfa and Mardin recently. <br /><br />So Turkey isn&#39;t attacking Kurds, Turkey is attacking terrorist organization. Of course PKK/YPG include Kurds, Arabs and even Turks and maybe people of other countries. It doesen&#39;t matter because if you are in a terrorist organization that means you are a terrorist, you are not Kurd, Arab, Turk etc. because when you join a terrortist organization you lose your race, region and civil identity. Terrorist is terrorist."

Comment 1083.5	I support Turkey, from Greece.
Comment1084	Is it me or did this video skip over the fact that turkey is invading over Syria borders? Or the many other facts and other aspects to this war? <br />For example Turkey are saying they are Acquiring this extra 30 miles of space, INTO Syria to ressetle refugees from Syria there, back at the border. Also skipping over the ISIS prison that is in the area that Turkey&#39;s government have said they don&#39;t want to pay for and so are going to leave 60,000 ISIS prisoners unguarded in an area thats pretty close to ISIS territory.
Comment 1084.1	No my friend... First of all, there are not 60.000 ISIS in the prisons in Syria. Also, those ISIS guys are not from Syria or Iraq or Turkey. They are from Germany, USA, Britan, France, etc. which means from Europe. Europian countries pays 700USD/man/ month to USA to keep them in Syria prisons. Is Syria a trash country, where Europian terrorists are dumped? Turkey will send them back to their own countries because, Turkey has an agreement with those countries and they have to take their trashes back. Did you understand, why Europian countries are against Turkey? üòâüòâüòâ
Comment1085	Kurds helped U.S to fight against ISIS, now U.S left them behind

Comment 1085.2	jake xu Turkey fights with isis. U.S helped to sdf , not kurds. There are so many kurds who dont support sdf or ypg. Sdf, ypg,ypj are part of pkk which is a communist terrorism organisation which is in the  USA terrorist groups list
Comment1086	Thats what muslims live for!

Comment1108	Its crazy world! when the human butchers are accusing Turk for human rights violations! <br />I&#39;m not supporting Turk with the invasion but I&#39;m asking my self &quot;how can USA and it&#39;s allies judge another country with invasion or violation, when we know what they are  doing on this world specially middle East 3rd  world? &quot;&quot;.
Comment1109	The UK government aided ISIS to try and topple Assad. So did the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Turkey helped them too for the first few years of the war against Syria...who had attacked none of them! They all worked with the terrorist cut throats and slave traders when it suited them.  I&#39;m sick of this rank hypocrisy and the dishonest reporting from the likes of the BBC and other mainstream outlets.
Comment1110	DISGUSTING display by the west, the kurds almost single handedly defeated ISIS and this is how we repay them? im utterly embarrassed to be European.... British.... and quite frankly.... I&#39;m embarrassed for humanity as a whole.
Comment1111	THE UNITED STATES PROMISED not to leave the Kurds. We asked them to help fight in Syria. In front of Congress we promised NOT to pull out our troops and leave them. Today they are getting SLAUGHTERED by Turkey because we pulled back our troops. I AM SO VERY ASHAMED OF THE UNITED STATES. We PROMISED THEM! Get angry AMERICA!
Comment1112	because this is yet another example of the British divide and conquer strategy... just another 100 year eternal war planned by the British partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. They will never have their own country because the British made it so! And why am I not surprised to see the US backing another terrorist organization in the middle east, YPG, and PKK. they didn&#39;t learn their lesson from Al-Qaeda. After this backstab, I&#39;m guessing there will be another 9-11 in America.
Comment1113	Kurds of Syria must attack on Iraqi government.  Turkey must respective the sovereignity of a state.
Comment1114	O its news again on the BBC.. There&#39;s millions of Syrians who left that land..of all religions. The Kurds did some nasty  things to the native Syrian peoples who lived there.. Just because you fight for America doesn&#39;t mean you get to keep what they promised. The Kurds tried to do this in Iraq and the Iraqi army went in..they were calling it Kurdistan. Get the American British French Israeli out and leave the peoples of the middle east to work there own problems out.. We all know this was known after 9.11 Iraq Syria Iran were all to be attacked..

Comment 1119.2	@Mohamed Hesham Not smart just love history(unlike most anericans). I&#39;ve also met arabs whom are so kind and have lost many family members. <br /><br />As for 9/11 my guess is Saudis worked in cooperation with the U.S. to train the pilots. The the day of the attack the U.S. flew every single interceptor(jet) out to the north Atlantic and gulf of mexico(so the planes wouldnt be interrupted on route to thier targets). This was unprecedented in the airforce&#39;s history. That is the only fact I need to know really. <br /><br />As for ISIS the cooperation was the same. Our CIA, saudis and Israel launch a massive program to train the most well armed, well trained, lighting quick, rapid response force the middle east has seen in 200 years(ISIS). It took a LOT of money and effort and it nearly paid off. As to why we created ISIS?... the same reason we create any terrorist group, to fight wars that are deemed too unpopular by the american people to fight directly. We tried to invade in 2014 when the first chemical attacks were faked. The American people didnt fall for it. So we sent in our mercenaries(isis). We supplied them till they had fully failed in thier mission to take down assad. <br /><br />If you can remember Israel and the U.S. even provided them with direct air support when assad and russia finally had them on the run. We did whatever it took to justify bombing Syrian air bases, even faked more chemical attacks. <br /><br />We tried so so very hard to invade ourselves near the end, but Russia is the worlds most powerful nuclear power(the edge us out slightly). War with them was too risky. So they won. And stopped the bloodshed. Neither assad or Russia are without sin but I am very proud of them for standing up to the unholy alliance(USA, Israel and Saudis) and winning. Really amazing if you think about it. Against all odds
Comment 1119.3	@Brandon E you are the smartest american I have seen in this comment section yet but about the starvation part no I wish no harm to anybody <br />There is one question I have tho? If the USA does actually train Isis how did 9/11 happen
Comment 1119.4	@Brandon E ‚ù§‚ù§
Comment 1119.5	@i Love Cops lol ! no one betray batter then usa
Comment1120	Wait why are all these comments here bashing US? The Kurds weren‚Äôt fight with us because they wanted stop isis they saw the rise of isis and a good time to try to make a country. How is that ok? What about the Assyrians whose land the Kurds stole just recently during the height of isis? This is why people‚Äôs opinions shouldn‚Äôt matter because you‚Äôre a bunch of donkies
Comment1121	Fake News channel ..
Comment1122	Turkey administration ideology is fascism a and racism there is no right for other ethnic groups in turkey
Comment 1122.1	Aso 20111111 yep that‚Äôs why free medicine, healthcare, and citizenship are given to most Syrian refugees living in turkey.
Comment1123	Mainly misleading information  from journalist. 1) Turkey is not attacking Kurds, but YPG terorists ( branch of PKK in Syria, PKK is a terorist organisation not only by Turkey, but also by EU and USA) 2) Most of those fumes coming from burning tires by YPG terorists in order to eliminate drone view.
Comment1124	Erdoan is invading Syria and everyone is blaming Trump ?<br />Maybe Mr. Trump just had enough of the Syrian Problem to which  he sees no solution and who can blame him.<br /><br />If you support the Kurds they will continue to fight the Turkish side in their Quest for a independent State therefore upsetting the Turkish side.<br /><br />If you do not support the Kurdish side you will aide the Islamic fractions in the region who will raise again.<br /><br />If you are against the Turks Erdoan will flood the world with refugees not bothering to check if any of them are former ISIS.<br /><br />(I think there are something like 3 million refugees in Turkey right now)<br /><br />If you continue to aid the Rebel force fighting Assad (manly Islamic Radicals with links to ISIS or Al Quijada) you will risk millions of dead Alawites and other Syrians who helped Assad once they would have won.<br /><br />Than he hase to take into account the different Russian, Iranian, Saudi Arabian, Israelian, European, Sunni, Shiite, and a bunch load of other party‚Äôs interests which will never coaling no wonder he has enough.<br /><br />Mr. Obama put the US is in a very expensive no win situation and he pulled the plug.

Comment1136	muslim murders 4 policemen in France !! Mmmm why did that story vanish?!!
Comment 1136.1	@,jgvfyufcgvk&#39; you kidding right. I&#39;ve never seen a coverup when a muslim murdered someone. It would have been big in the article that he was muslim, just like you with your comment. If a white person does this, it wouldn&#39;t even gain that much interest in the media, since it&#39;s always Propaganda against muslims. They would say Paul M. murdered.. And muslims don&#39;t murder in the name of their religion, the IS does this but they are anything but no muslims anymore, they seperated themselves a long time ago from Islam
Comment 1136.2	@Purple Floyd Christians are not killing people in the name of Christianity.  If it had been a white person the BBC would label them white supremacist etc, and droned on about it for weeks.  Soon as it came out it was a muslim it&#39;s covered up.  that&#39;s the difference.
Comment 1136.3	I wouldnt be surprised if  the bbc blame the manchester arndale stabbings on knives, and not some  Muslim looser
Comment 1136.4	actually I&#39;m surprised that this wasn&#39;t in the media. Since he was a muslim, this would have been all over the world, but they have to deal with better Propaganda now. I don&#39;t even understand why you had to mention which religion he had. I don&#39;t think that you would have said christian murders if he was christian.
Comment 1136.5	because they‚Äôre only 4? grow a pair?
Comment1137	If the attack on Saudi ARAMCO couldn&#39;t get the cattle into conflict; this will; and if this couldn&#39;t, they&#39;ll stage another 9/11; Hegelian Dialectic at work; one incremental step at a time, until the synagogue of satan achieve their wet dream, The New World Order.
Comment1138	BBC is a disgusting media that doesn&#39;t show the truth. Turkey attacks YPG/PYD aka PKK which is recognized as a terrorist organization by the U.S and the EU. But somehow our &quot;ally&quot; US didn&#39;t want to destroy ISIS with Turkey but they chose our enemies. Why? All Turkish people know why. Turkey will not be divided! We won&#39;t allow this plan to happen. I wish everyone in the world knew how much our people suffer from those terrorists (PKK/YPG/PYD and ISIS) Fuck them all! We are gonna kill them all!

But when Turkey starts an operation right at its southern Border to get rid of a terror organisation, all the western powers who have a long tradition of attacking weak 3rd world countries, killing thousands of people just to be able to steal the natural resources of that country, just like in the old colonial days, become worried about human rights???

All the western powers know this, so they align themselfs with a marxist terror organisation to achieve there strategic goals wich is primarily to one day be able to attack IRAN , here take a look at Senator Graham in a US senat hearing talking about it  &quot; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLiVjIv9fdc%22"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLiVjIv9fdc&quot;</a>.

Comment 1159.4	@mcmatthew7898 here in turkey we have 4 milion syrian refuges and most of them have come from the northen syria, why do you think that they left their home and come to turkey as an refuge. Nobody wants to be refugee.

FACT (3) PKK/YPG have been launching terrorist attacks in Turkey since 1984 and murdered 40,000 civilians so far (some of them were Kurdish origin Turks). FACT (4) Most ISIS terrorists were nourished in the European countries and travelled to Syria to get rid of the Esad regime.

FACT (6) The Turkish Republic have been looking after 4 million Syrian refugees (Syrian Kurds and Arabs) in last 8 years with minimum financial help from the international community.

FACT (7) The Turkish Republic has 15 million Kurdish origin Turkish citizens. These Kurdish origin Turks&#39; ancestors fought against British, French, Italian...invaders during the Turkish Republic Independence War. So there is nothing against Kurds whatsoever!

Comment1164	I don&#39;t believe the Turkish Government  is really so concerned about the Kurds. They have for years been able to keep the at bay. What the Turks are really after is a huge land-grab. They propose to take an area a little larger than the U.S. State of Rhode Island (1336 sure miles). Of course once they take it with Trumps blessing they will then have a larger vulnerable area than before. Does that make any sense? Trump not only betrayed the Kurdish fighting forces, he betrayed the entire Kurdish people of consisting of 30,000,000 souls.

It is so complicated that it is normal to you to not understand the case. And they use it for their own propaganda.
Comment 1166.3	No you cretin Turkey doesn&#39;t prefer is over pkk. Is declared jihad against Turkey years ago. Did suicide bombings. Both pkk and is are enemies of turkey. Turks are capable of annihilating both groups. The problem is usa has been protecting kurds for israel&#39;s sake. Kurds are pro israel anti turk anti arab and to some extent also anti perisan.

Comment1171	Dear Kurds, unfortunately, you will never ever have an independent state in that region. You need to get land from Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Iran. Is it possible to do that? NO! You can get a land in a welcoming European country or in the US since they are so keen on looking after you and shelter you. Otherwise, just suck it up and try becoming good citizens of the countries you are in already. In Turkey, there are 15 million Kurdish origin Turks. Turkey has had Kurdish origin president (Turgut Ozal), many ministers... You already have lots of rights in these countries as citizens. Carry on demanding other rights peacefully instead of going and fighting for a terrorist organization like PKK/YPG. You&#39;re harming yourself and anyone around you by doing what you are doing. Be logical!

Comment1178	Love support and respact from Pakistan for our turk brothers and sisters
Comment1179	I think it&#39;s essential to mention that there is proof and it&#39;s also been confirmed by senator Lindsey Graham that the kurdish fighters known as the YPG are linked to the kurdish terror organization called PKK that has killed over 40,000 turkish and kurdish civilians. They for example were responsible for the shooting &amp; bomb explosion at the Atat√ºrk Airport in Istanbul, which took the lives of over 50 innocent people. For me saying that &quot;Turkey attacks kurds&quot; is not only very misleading, but also a big disrespect for the kurdish people who live in Turkey including my family, whose relatives were kidnapped or killed by the PKK and YPG.
Comment 1179.1	As a Kurd, I know better than any western people how really the Turks are and what they did to us. all that shit about PKK being terrorists and killing turks for no reason is just bullshit they only fight back when the Turkish army attacks them. Turks had been invaders for centuries and i don&#39;t think i should say much about the Ottoman empire cause we all know how they were. Turks are invaders and mostly racists. It&#39;s in their blood. I wish anyone who says those bad things about Kurds just come and live in the Kurdish cities of Turkey and see for themselves what the Turkish Government is really like. I bet you will have a different thing to say then.
Comment 1179.2	A great explanation, thanks for being critical thinker. However western media knows the truth, but for the benefits of europea, they buy cheap oil from terrorist group ypg, they support ypg.
Comment1180	After ww1 - Israel was on its way to nationhood .  But Kurds were denied a state till this day .  This is of course is a double standard .  Its high time the Kurds were united into one contiguous nation in portions of northern Iraq, Iran and Syria and given also Southeast portion of Turkey .  I am an American of northern european descent .  But I think it is high time the hispanics in the southwest US and the Native American Indians(where ? good question ) should also have their separate  nations carved out of the USA .

Comment1216	Its not a war between Kurds and Turks. in Turkey a lot of different type of culture and ethnic origin lives together with peace and respect ...yes its a Turkic country but Turkish means citizen of Turkey its a international I.D a Kurd can be doctor, police oficer or anythink you think.These videos are lies about civil war and story of freedom fighthers... pkk and ypg is same group that financed by imperialist states for devide the borders for energy ways and strategic points in area.Turkic Persian Caucasian Arabic and other origin nations going to live together in peace in their mothetlands.These operations are against multinational sepetatis groups like isis and pkk/pyd/ypg they tried to seperate Turkish/Armenian border with asala terror group and they failed. asala was working with pkk, their pkk plan is going to fail to...People in word is able to think and see the truth... Peace
Comment 1216.1	@M Kid You are the brainwashed one here.
Comment 1216.2	M Kid Act of a group in entire Kurdish population does not means all of em wants what they want...You are telling me st*u but im not gonna tell same thing to you, i want you to keep writing here, keep confessing the betrayal of that groups you believe to every country they live in every oportunities.Maybe im realy brainwashed like u said and its a false that u r not an 13 year old kid... but can you tell me how you gonna take land from Turkey or Iran while u attacking to civils and patroling soldiers with your armed groups and suicide bombers against more than 1000 year old armies and why non seperatist Kurds going to join you ?
Comment 1216.3	And what your saying is in no way true, we wont ask for borders if we werent suppresed by you, the kurds have been suppresed for hundreds of years by iran, iraq syria and turkey ever scince ww1 ended, we were betrayed by the US, we helped topple that Saddam Hussein maniac, but that doesnt count, we rose up against the ottomens in ww1 and helped topple it, but according to donald trump that doesnt count, we spiled our blood for isis, and that doesnt count, apparently what does count is normandy, which we didnt help in because we were to ignorant or because we had no choice as we didnt have the state promised to us by the US in ww1, turkey is a pure chaos, peshmerga were seen as terorists just like ypg until iraq finaly gave em land and the true story came out about the suppression, so get facts before you get opinions, if kurds dont want to be part of turkey give em a free state or just be a dick head and invade their brother land, urdowan is a dictator, and thats a fact, EMERGENCY POWER can be anything, and right now it is kurdish blood,
Comment 1216.4	stfu u brainwashed aurdowan kisser

Comment1218	Turkish ASSASINS.
Comment 1218.1	There is no freaking genocide, no attempt to wipe out any ethnic group. Why are you trying to lie as there is? Shit-I live in harmony with my next door neighbors (they are from Mardin and are Kurds) in Istanbul and you bunch of know-it-alls, far far away from ground zero of all this chaos of terrorism, just try to plant another seed of hatred among us. How dare you accuse me and millions of others with such horrible things? How can you assume I would ever want my neighbors dead? I can‚Äôt even fathom. It‚Äôs just an another topic for you guys to ignorantly comment about. You have no idea how real and awful it is for us to go through all of this. We want peace in Middle East more than any of you believe me on that one but we also help those in need. Turkish citizens has been paying twice as much for the taxes even for the smallest and simplest things since we opened our door for poor Syrians and saved their lives (unlike any other nation), only to save up money so we can help them even further. We do not complain and would do it again. <br /><br /><br />Please have some decency whilst you share your opinion.
Comment 1218.2	@simay kavraz there&#39;s nothing to troll here. Civils killed by  crazy turkish dictator with the consense of the orange haired president USA isn&#39;t a joke. BOYCOTT TURKEY in every possible way is the only way to act for us common people to stop this massacre.
Comment 1218.3	Andrea Andrea great movie! I would also recommend American Assassin, Dylan O‚ÄôBrien did a great job there. It‚Äôs better than the ‚ÄòTurkish Assassins‚Äô since of course America is the absolute best in such fields as violence. <br /><br />Best wishes ‚úåüèª

Comment1228	Turkey says india is violating human rights in kashmir and also says that ypg is a terrorist organizatio.tukey uses airstrikes,artilery fire,tanks against the kuds to displace them off their land probably this is not human rights violation for turkey.turkey statement call for muslim unite against india since it is a hindu majority nation but i have one question is turks real muslim who are desperate to shade the blood of another sunni muslim kurds .it is hear that ethnic clinsing is done by turkey but in kashmir ethnicity is same of kasmiris wih rest of india and not religion because 18 crores plus muslim leaves in all parts of india but kashmir being a muslim majority wants freedom.if being a muslim makes kashmir separate than apz abdul kalam have made nuclear weapons and agni missile program capable of hitting 10000 km so be ready to full muslim if kashmiris are against us you call for muslim unite than 18 crores plus muslim can defeat full umma for their nation and their religion is a matter of privacy.nation first than religion

Comment 1237.1	@Diggnuts are u historianüòÇ a liar historian
Comment 1237.2	Yes, as a historian I study both the historical and contemporary socio-political contexts and it is fair to say that any detractor/denier or advocate for this Turkish aggression is just as rotten, corrupt and evil as a holocaust denier.<br /><br />The reason is that Turks are deluded to think there is some part of the Ottoman empire left while obviously there isn&#39;t. In that crippling inferiority complex, the only traditional enemy in sight are the ones that sided with Russia several hundreds of years ago. It is a retarded reason to condemn a generation 8 times removed. Turks are idiots.

Comment1242	Seriously?<br />Wondering who or what moved 4 millions of Syrians from their warm homes to 81 cities of Turkey..?
Comment 1242.1	‚Äã@OZ Z I tried mate, believe me, since these stuff started to happen I&#39;ve spent countless hours researching all sources, not just friendly ones. Shared the links / youtube videos / news all with their google search image guarantee (most pictures shared at such events are false information, hence it is best to google image search them one by one before believing them) but unfortunately Youtube / CNN / Channel4 and even Al Jazeera (doubt it was Al Jazeera, ironically that&#39;s the most democratic news/channel out of all the others) deleted or blocked my comments. Even my comments on Music videos doesn&#39;t show up (only replies to existing messages show up) for a while now. <br />If you refer to the Kurdish population in Turkey or any other information I&#39;ve already given though, it is really easy to find out on web. The hard part is as I told; to filter and make sure they are true. :)<br />And about the claims on the so called Armenian Genocide, the numbers I gave alone is actual numbers from Wiki pages too, the only part needed to be done is basic maths to come to a conclusion, rather then listening Political Lobbyist&#39;s stories.. since they mostly show up just before elections and act like historians just for votes.. and there are few good targets in the region to demonize other than Turkey.. (Just like Turkish politicians try to demonize Greece just before elections.. it is the reality of Politics)
Comment 1242.2	@Mateo Lemaster for sure yes There are around 14 million KURDS who are living in Turkey now. There is absolutely NO conlict in between Turks and Kurds. Kurdish people were deprived of their basic rights around 35 years ago. But not anymore. U can see many Kurdish people in all sorts of jobs and positions. Turkey is against PKK. Just make a simple google search and see how many Turkish soldiers and civillians PKK killed since 80 s. U d be amazed !
Comment 1242.3	@Demran brother, can u show some kind of source to all u said?<br /><br />It d be really interesting to read all of this from a factual source. Thanks
Comment 1242.4	@Mateo Lemaster Turkey has 16+ Million Kurdish population. They are not refugees - they are not immigrants and they are proud to call themselves Turks. (There are 56 different ethnicities in Turkey if you include minor ones too). <br />Even most Kurdish people in Iran and Iraque support Turkey, and quite a large number of Syrian Kurds as well. (450.000 of the Syrian Refugees in Turkey are actually Kurdish Syrians).<br />While PKK the Terrorist Organization consists of 25000-30000 US armed militants, most of which are Kurds. <br />So when Western Media says &quot;Turkey kills Kurds&quot;, it is actually like 1% of Kurdish population which became a Terrorist Organization, to do US&#39; bidding in Middle East.
Comment 1242.5	OZ Z PKK is the name of the group of Kurds fighting against Turkey?? It‚Äôs not all Kurds and Turks hate one another, just this specific group of hostile Kurds? Do Turks and Kurds already residing in Turkey generally get along and work well amongst each other?

All u need is Indus water. U know wat? It was king himself who seceded it to India along sheikh abudullah who later became cm. So technically ppl was okay with India.

Armenian gangs gathered Turks in mosques and then they burned them alive. Our grandfathers always told us these facts. After all, the Ottoman Empire popped from the country the Armenians to protect the people. Didn&#39;t kill anyone, just took them away from Anatolia.

Comment1273	Why Syrian Kurds choice other nation as allies instead of the Syrian government?
Comment 1273.1	Because they are sluts.
Comment 1273.2	Kurds were already used to divide syrian for Israel. Accordingly. Is this true?
Comment 1273.3	Because Syrian government did not give them citizenship, you know this better than everyone
Comment1274	Why turkey are bombing Syria at time we are finally Muslim
Comment1275	President Trump made the right tough decision!  Our mission was to destroy ISIS.  PERIOD!  That is it, and the only reason we were in Syria.  We destroyed ISIS from their last position in March.  We no longer have any reason or invitation to be in Syria...a foreign country.  It was past time to get out.  The Kurds knew up front we were only aligned in our fight against ISIS...not in their civil WAR.  We aren&#39;t some band of brothers with them.  If our interests weren&#39;t aligned on ISIS they would turn fight us too.  They also would have expected us to leave Syria when the ISIS fight was over.  The Kurds want to occupy and hold onto ground that isn&#39;t theirs which ISIS had caused Syrians to flee from.  Syria and Turkey do not want the Kurds occupying that land.  Whether right or wrong, this condition, civil war with the Kurds, Turkey, and Syria existed long before us.  It is not our WAR, it is their own civil war.  Trump absolutely made the right call in moving US advisers out of that conflict.   I hope Trump does sanction Turkey, and support the Kurds as much as possible, but it is not our WAR...it is theirs.  Turkey is a NATO ally and supported NATO in the Iraq and Serbia wars.  Turkey also has a large Air Force and possesses nuclear bombs to defend NATO.   Is that a WAR you want President Trump to push America into, then you are insane, uninformed, or just simply as usual a Democrat who just hates everything Trump does with out justification.
Comment 1275.1	Supporting the Kurds as much as possible would only destabilize the region more. The statistics show that the Kurds have killed 14 thousand between 1984 and 2015. They want to conquer all their surrounding region to establish their own sovereign state. Turkey needs this safezone to keep the Kurds away from its border. I agree with both the decisions of Trump and Erdogan on this. Unfortunately, there was no diplomatic solution to this and innocents are suffering as we speak :(

Comment1315	Turkey is not bombing &quot;The Kurds&quot;. It has launched an operation against PKK/YPG terrorists and is establishing a safety zone in a region that is Arab majority. These so-called &quot;Kurds&quot; are vicious, child-conscripting, suicide-bombing cadres that answers to  Turkish-speaking PKK leadership in the Qandil mountains. They want to ethnically cleanse Arab majority regions and think living next to Arabs &quot;dilutes the culture,&quot; hence &quot; Rojava. &quot; Meanwhile you media, Britain or the EU,  don&#39;t raise a peep about current Russian bombings of Idlib or refugees starved by Centcom in Rukban. Turkish/FSA operations have been the cleanest in Syria, with infinitely less loss of life than Centcom/PKK operations. Nor do you EU fanatics lift a finger to help with the millions of Syrian refugees in Turkey, which include 1000s of Kurds fleeing YPG/Pkk conscription. The hypocrisy is astounding. Just quit with the Saudi/UAE/Israeli/ Brett McGurk propaganda, because it seems you EU either want all Turks, Kurds and Arabs to either die or live in a Stalinist state.
Comment1316	Im saying this to all europeans and americans and whatever place you are from. The media currently is all lies. They are defending and arming them for a reason . My message is please just go and do research from other sources and look at the Turkish side of the story.

Comment 1318.4	Moral of the story the USA helped you during a time where both the Kurds and the USA had a common enemy to fight and now that the USA has trained and armed them it‚Äôs time for the Kurds to gain their independence through their own means! I say good luck I hope you are successful but don‚Äôt act as if the USA is a backstabber because I see no contract or agreement between their government and the Kurds where they said we will help fight for your independence! Wrong! We (USA) agreed to help fight a group (Isis) that both the Kurds and the USA didn‚Äôt like! That‚Äôs all! Sorry if you had unbelievable expectations but TRUMP is the president of USA and his interests are with the American people first and foremost!
Comment 1318.5	@flungingpictures they bought it cuz US was supporting the ypg in Syria who would eventually fuel the insurrection in Turkey. The US went against Turkish interests from the start.

Comment 1319.1	@BonnieSumo100 Half of kurds still vote for Erdoƒüan&#39;s party. And more than half of Kurds leave their poor region and live in parts Turks live. So how do you know all kurds want independence ? Let&#39;s say if we give them a country, do you think the kurds living in Turkish area will leave for a new poor country ? Also what about Catalans ? They clearly want to leave Spain. They even made a referendum. But you will see Turks only.
Comment 1319.2	If Northern Ireland wanted to be part of the Republic of Ireland it would be but we have a thing called democracy and the majority of Northern Ireland want to remain with Britain. Remember we had a empire which we gave up because the people wanted to rule themselves, we allowed them, Northern Ireland did not want to go, its the violent IRA who bomb innocent people who are the bad guys. The majority of Kurds want independence, Turkey is not allowing them, there a difference. We have the democratic will of the people, the Turks don&#39;t, they are more a suppressor.

There are over 3,5 million arab syrian refugees in Turkey and Afrin was kurdish dominant syrian city.After the invasion of Afrin in 2018 200 thousand Kurds left the city. The goal was to drive out the kurds and push Syrian arabs into these territories so that in the future there are no kurds close to Turkey. But this is ethnic cleansing. Turkey has over 25% kurds and they are afraid. Turkey is the agressor. Rather turkey should have cooporated with Assad so he could unite the Kurds back into Syria. Turkey is doing war crimes.

Comment1342	Anyone in U.K. who watches live TV broadcasts on TV or radio or watched or receives any BBC TV or radio by laws has to pay for the BBC TV license.  Now if you don‚Äôt pay the BBC TV license you can be fined or go to prison .  Many people are confused and believed just because they have a TV in their house assume they have to pay the BBC TV license and they do not wish to face prison or heavy fines if they don‚Äôt so they pay it. Now it may be possible that they didn‚Äôt need to pay for the license. If you look at the rules they are often vague and intimidating should the fee not be paid. The government have a BBC charter in place allowing these laws to exist and be enforced.  The BBC is absolutely not allowed to be biased and if there is a bias complaints have to be filed via two concurrent methods via the BBC complaints service and failing the outcome of this the third line of appeal is through OFCOM . It really is very beurocratic and long winded .   There is no freedom of choice and there is unfortunately plenty of bias.  It is long winded and complex deliberately in order to maintain the current level of subscriptions to the BBC TV license which collects many billions of pounds per year.  In summary the government allows laws to exist which are unfair.

Comment 1355.2	@Algerie no way phahaha youre so stupid im sorry... you should change your information sources but even if you do your situation seems lost.
Comment 1355.3	@Algerie no way This is the dumbest shit I&#39;ve ever heard
Comment 1355.4	@Blue Sky &quot;Zionists and the oligarchy&quot; want a line that separate turkey from other islamic countries ( Syria - Iraq) ..a line from iran to mediterranean sea ( where we found natural gas) .. a line that his citizens never speak arabic so that they can&#39;t speak with other arabic neighbors so they will be easy controlled by the American media( in other word: media of the &quot;oligarchy  &quot;).. if this line is established &quot; israeil &quot; will invade all of syria so easily ( greater Israeil ) ... this line is under the name of  (( KURDiSTAN))
Comment1356	"Turkey must understand that it cannot resolve the Kurdish problems themselves. They should withdraw from Syria and let Russia Iran Iraq and Syria solve the problems. Then PEACE will prevail, and then economic progress can be made within an Economic Block with Russia Iran Iraq Turkey AND the Caspian and SCO countries. The main driver will be O&amp;G industries and the BRI projects.<br />Turkey bombing the Kurds. <br />This is a bitter lesson for the Kurds and all others around the world. As stated in the Quran and hadith Never Trust the Zionist Jews to honor their Agreements. They will eventually betray you. Many examples during the Prophet‚Äôs time until today. Sad Bad. Turks please exercise restraint and be Compassionate <br />The Kurds should have surrendered to the Syrian government"
Comment 1356.1	@Yusuf Deveci Because unlike the Iranians and Russians Turkey was never invited to help the Syrians. Therefore, by international law, it is called an invasion. And by Islamic law killing another Muslim brother will guarantee you a place in Hell. Yes, life is not easy but there must be patience otherwise there will be eternal animosity between Kurds and Turks. Your grandchildren would not like that, wouldn&#39;t they?
Comment 1356.2	Stop just stop the second u said you should let Russia solve the problem ? Iran? Lmfaoo  Russia been involved in Syria doing dirty work
Comment 1356.3	My friend, who believed in Zionists, took money and weapons against other Muslims? Turks or PKK? I don&#39;t count PKK as Kurdish, because there are many Armenians and non-muslims. Now Zionists are betraying to betrayers... üáπüá∑üáπüá∑üáπüá∑

Comment 1357.1	@Gavin Lim Not my concern who is converting to Atheism. In the end Muslim are the only one resisting western traditions, every else besides Muslims are adapting the western culture, even Hindus and China. Islam is the only alternative, every other religious people are mainly hobbyists, not really religious.
Comment 1357.2	@mirkaa r u talking about last century? .. u fought with the Kurdish in 2019 in Syrian war...They were ur allies last week, smelly traitors
Comment 1357.3	@Ali Hendrickson Wrong. Moon God worshippers are the ones turning to atheism at record levels. Moo See Leems are sick &amp; tired of bowing to a pagan building called the Kaabah instead of bowing towards Baitul Maqdis üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Comment 1357.4	@Gavin Lim Why not? In the will be only Atheists and Muslims left.
Comment 1357.5	@Ali Hendrickson Islam had 1400 years to expand but it still has only, 100 million more adherents than atheist China, 300 million more adherents than the Hindus &amp; 1.1 billion less adherents than the Christians. How long do you need to expand? Another 1400 years?? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Comment1358	Turkey is fighting with the terrorists and Daesh, not with Kurds. All you tell are LIES.
Comment1359	The turkish people are delusional and have an undeserved superiority complex they dont only want the land that the kurds have they want to do an ethnic cleansing of the kurdish people!!! Turks should go back to mongolia and play with their horses
Comment 1359.1	Mongolia doesn&#39;t welcome them back lol
Comment 1359.2	turkey is made of many kurds. i dont see them gas chamber-ing there own kurds.
Comment1360	Poor kurds
Comment1361	Twice we have turned our backs to the Kurds
Comment 1361.1	@kerwin green yeh they will fight because they have no other option. No state, no army, no economy and no life. First Saddam gassed thousands of them than ISIS steamrolled through them and now Turkey is going to hammer the final nail into the coffin.
Comment 1361.2	@kerwin green yes. The bad thing is everyone thinks that they know what game is being played, while in fact nobody does. Everyone believes in the lies which their country and media are telling. So, I am turkish, and i don&#39;t really support this operation since I don&#39;t know the ins and outs of it. But i defend it online. It&#39;s a minor effort to balance out the propaganda that is against it. If propaganda was for it, I would talk against the operation. Ok, i know you&#39;re like wtf but the point is, we don&#39;t know anything, whether if we are from turkey or eu or us. I wish people could calm the f down.
Comment 1361.3	@Esas √áocuk, never can tell what game is being played yet it is a political game being played out with lives.
Comment 1361.4	@kerwin green they will not surrender. They will die. That is, if this whole operation is not again a play just like others in the past
Comment1362	Muslims doing Muslim thing.<br />Leave them alone ffs.
Comment1363	kurds? you do realize that in the Turkish military alone, there are millions of kurds right? Thousands of them are on the field for this operation as i am writing this ... <br />Which kurds are you talking about ? West should stop being allies with terrorist organizations
Comment 1363.1	@Dorke De and where was the world looking when PKK was killing thousands of soldiers and civillians for more than 20 years?<br />some just ignored this, and some even dared to call them &quot;freedom fighters&quot; <br /><br /><br />I wonder how americans would feel if, say, asians living in america claimed a land for themselves and wanted to build their own nation there. and when the government say no they form a terrorist organization, do suicide bombings and ambushes to both military and civilians and set mines on the roads etc. <br />And the entire world either ignores the presence of the said organization, refuse to call it a &quot;terrorist&quot; organization, and some even call them &quot;freedom fighters&quot;<br />how would you feel about that if that ever happened to your country?
Comment1364	4 million Syrian refugees live in Turkey.<br /><br />15-20 million Kurds people live in peace Turkey. It&#39;s news lie. Turkey don&#39;t kill civilians. <br /><br />Turkey fighting ISIS,PKK,YPG,YPJ,PYD
Comment1365	PKK says that they are protecting Kurds in the area while Kurds are making only 10% of total population. But PKK controlles 50% of area. Makes sense. PKK kicked Syrian Arabs out of their cities and they placed Kurds there to make it like these cities were always Kurdish. Right now, there are 3m Syrian Arabs who fled to Turkey because of PKK&#39;s cruel control on the area. But biased west media tries to show it like Turkey is fighting Kurds as a ethnic group. But the reality is we actually stand together with Kurds in Turkey against PKK. Because PKK also kills Kurds too. They kidnap Kurdish boys and girls to use them as human shields and fighters. But Kurdish families protested this recently. You can search &quot;Anne Eylemi&quot;. Unfortunatelly, there are no English reports about it.
Comment1366	12 million or so of that total of 30 million Kurds currently lives in Turkey. Kurds are not the target. YPG and it&#39;s branches are.
Comment 1366.1	@pro plus Mate these are all cool and all but this all sounds like a big stretch. You can make them sound whatever you like them to sound but what the verses mean, is what they mean. The verses you cited from Bible doesn&#39;t specify or forsee a war between Kurds and Turks. Qur&#39;an doesn&#39;t mention Turks either. Turks are only mentioned by the Prophet in only two hadiths. And this operation, is not an all out war. <br /><br />Believe me when I say &quot;Kurdish citizens in Turkey are tired of this conflict between Kurds and Turks&quot;. They don&#39;t want to be a part of this conflict anymore. Syrian and Iraqi Kurds on the other hand, want this conflict to last, last for a long time.
Comment 1366.2	Furthermore the Quran refers to rum  and states clearly in surat at rum..  this Surah deals with byzantines. The people of byzantine were Greeks whom inhibited Roman empire and lived in turkey.. called themselves rhomaioi.. and also in this rum also refers to some arabs..  eventually the seljuk turks took over this and you know your countries history better than I.
Comment 1366.3	@√úns√ºz Herif the prophet muhammed had already prophesied that the race of atark(turks) would become dominant and that they would conquer arabs.. which we can see now diyarbakirs name comes from land of bakrs... which was originally arab name given. The atrak are a group of races originating from mongolia and Caucasus mountains. The prophet said also said that fighting the turks will lead to you losing.
Comment 1366.4	@√úns√ºz Herif Jeremiah 51:8-29 also the bible states the purpose of god is to make babylon without inhabitants.. so I believe soon these lands will again crumble
Comment 1366.5	"@√úns√ºz Herif Isaiah <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrxIvUTerXM&amp;t=13m17s"">13:17</a>  behold I am going to stir up the medes against them. Jeremiah <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrxIvUTerXM&amp;t=51m11s"">51:11</a>  the lord has aroused the spirit of the kings of the medes, because his purpose is against babylon to destroy it"
Comment1367	WELL, GET UR FACTS RIGHT! TURKEY IS NOT BOMBING THE KURDS.. TURKEY IS BOMBING THE YPG-PYD WHICH ARE THE ARM OF TERROIST ORG PKK.
Comment1368	Real asking; why is Turkey bombing the terrorist groups
Comment1369	Turkey is bombing YPG/PKK who are American/Israeli proxy terrorists. They&#39;ve have killed more than 40,000 civilians in the past 50 years. (I.e. several dozen times more than ISIS and Al-Qaeda american proxy terrorists combined)<br /><br />As we speak, YPG has shelled Turkish border towns, and syrian refugee camps injuring and killing several dozens of civilians.<br /><br />Kurds aren&#39;t the target. Turkey houses millions of Kurds and Many Syrian Kurdish groups have backed the Turkish Anti Terror operations.<br /><br />BBC and the other western media along with western governments are nothing but terrorist creators, sympathisers and supporters.<br /><br />The Muslim world is far to tolerant of the west backing terrorist groups. There should be a direct retaliation against the west.<br /><br />Terrorist nations (U.S/U.K/Israel/Saudi etc) who create and back proxy terrorist militiasn shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly. They need to be dealt with militarily.

Why armenians didn&#39;t accept our invite for research about this subject? They didnt open library to researchers because they are know that it is not genocide. It is big lie.
Comment 1373.2	@Dorke De Ask Armenia why they dont want to share history books of that years. You will find your answer there.
Comment 1373.3	Not genocide. Tehcir(Forced Migration). OK, fuck this I am not gonna explain the difference between these two things for the 999999th time.

Comment 1377.2	@Serious Nurturing Kill/imprison extremists. Live peacefully with the normal ones. That&#39;s the rule. Anyways, this is not about religion. Pkk kurds want their own country. In turkish lands/right at the border. Turkey sees this as a threat. And there&#39;s a war going in between pkk and turkey for decades. So this happens. Keep calm and keep researching. Try different sources. Not only eu or us or russian ir whatever. Listen to all if them and think for yourself.
Comment 1377.3	pranav kumar It‚Äôs good this way. we need to punish extremist radicals from all religions to the max so that anyone in the future won‚Äôt even think of doing things like that. And I even include terrorist organizations like ISIS, Al Qaeda and PKK. Also I want to tell the people that Media is only giving you half of the story about this Turkish and PKK matter. This is done so that they can bash trump as the narrative they are giving to us right now is trump is a liar. He might as well be but PKK are not the saints that media is telling us.

Comment 1394.1	Dorke De Wrong, PKK has pretty much turned in to a terrorist group. Turkey wants to get rid of PKK militias in Syria to give the refugees a better life and PKK is responsible for the death of Turkish civilians including children. 11 civilians dead, dozens of Turkish soldiers and many pro Turkish faction dead. It‚Äôs not ethnic cleansing. They fight PKK because they believe that they are terrorists and also many Syrian Arabs and Kurds left to Turkey because of the alleged cruel rule of Syria. This is what media is not telling you. ‚ÄúObjective journalism‚Äù at it‚Äôs finest.

Comment 1395.3	@Dorke De You are wrong my friend, North of Syria there are 3 million Arabs, Turkmenian, Kaldanies, etc. but only 400.000 Kurds. That&#39;s why the name of the country is Syrian Arab Repuclic. You now nothing about Syria or have misinformation. PKK kicked Arabs, Kurds and Turkmenians out from their homes to Turkey 4 years ago and took the control there. But in the mean time, they kept torturing still staying Arabs and Kurds... Killed their leaders and captured by force their kids to make them terrorist. PKK gets money frƒ±m USA over each terrorist.

Comment1414	Turkey is not bombing ‚ÄúKurds‚Äù. It is not about nationality. Turkey is bombing universal terrosist organizations such as PKK, YPG, and SDG.

You can no longer trust or count to my country of USA
Comment 1415.1	@Sassa Gaki The pkk in a way is a turkey isis. Turkey has had problems in that area long before we invaded. Its a turkey problem. And if you feel that way, please by all means go control that area using the pkk. I do know others can touch us, but how is bombing countries going to stop terrorism. If anything it will make it worse. We could be bombed by anyone at any moment, even by terrorists in our own country.
Comment 1415.2	@pandasniper1 , if you think Turkey cares about eliminating / controlling ISIS you clearly dont know your history.<br />ISIS is a threat to all. Are we still that ignorant to believe no one can touch us? Did we learn nothing from 911 ?

Comment 1416.2	You are a hypocrite. Turks always are using Kurds for their own benefits, deceiving Kurds by saying we are Muslims we are brothers but at the end of day Turks forbad Kurdish language and culture. Is that the way how your Allah is teaching you? How nasty way to treat Kurds?

Comment 1420.3	@Cyka Blyad FREE KURDYSTAN UPRISING
Comment 1420.4	@KS turkish government led them away. <br />Here is the deep explanation. <br /><br />European countries pushed armenian groups to riot and create a autonomoua regime/country in turkey, meanwhile turkey was in war. Therefore, the people who did chaos in the country were forcibly removed from turkey instead of get killed(which is real genocide). So this is named as relocation but not genocide, which all the countries have the right to do that in proper situations.<br /><br />The lesson has been done, you can go home kiddo.

Comment 1428.3	@Mohamed Hesham Most of the natives were killed through disease. They weren&#39;t wiped out in camps.
Comment 1428.4	@kingsong FY We are either imperialists policing the world or we are backstabbers leaving our allies behind. Which do you want? Do you want the US to stay in the Middle East or leave it? You can&#39;t have both. The only mistake we made was pulling out without giving the Kurds time to prepare. Aside from that, we took a step in the right direction by leaving. America should never have set foot in the middle east. All that has done was fuck the region over.

Comment 1429.3	@angelxc , there r so many videos in youtube , where Captured/surrendered IS terrorists saying how thousands of man women went through Turkey to join ISIS, where they getting food,water,shelter even training to fight against Sdf,kurds. Fsa ally Al qaeda,isis and Turkey helping Fsa, so who the real Terrorist?? Like Pakistanis giving shelter to Kashmiri Terrorists, who fight against India.. Turkey,Saudis provoking the Terrorism in middle east, but if someone plays with Fire, get ready to be hands burned.

Comment1434	BBC usual bull crap lies bombing Kurds turkey have 30 million kurd live in turkey why go anywhere
Comment1435	Is it so difficult to say PYD-SDF/PKK instead of Kurdish fighters? Those terrorists don&#39;t represent Kurdish people. Turkey is fighting with terrorists, not Kurds. Turkey saves the people of the region from PYD terrorism, while the Kurds here support the operation, calling these terrorists &quot;Kurdish fighters&quot; is just a purely propaganda.
Comment1436	Why Obama give weapons to Terorists?<br />Turk and kurds are brother.<br />You are very bad propagandist.

Comment 1439.1	@Azam Khan Well brother, as long as the Saudi-Wahabbi and British alliance rules the Hejaz it is unfortunately impossible to restore power in Muslim hands, I suppose you know why I said so. The problem is within us, we people don&#39;t stand against our puppet governments, whether it be of Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, UAE  or any other Muslim country having significance, it is unfortunate and yet painful to say that as long as Muslims keep justifying the killing and oppression of other Muslims under the banner of Nationalism, secularism, or sectarian groups they condition will not improve but will yet worsen.

Comment 1466.1	First I make a strong distinction between governments and people, but America shouldn&#39;t have gotten involved in the first place and YES it shouldn&#39;t have left at this particular time knowing very well what would happen.<br />We are used to decades of  hypocrisy from UK and the US : they have messed up the world by creating and fanning tensions and/or bombing non existent WMD&#39;s and terrorists (A big part of Africa, Palestine/Israel, India/Pakistan to name only those). You are telling me the US has suddenly decided to stop being the (corrupt) cop of the world? This is just a one off situation and even in leaving, the US manages to be destabilizing because of the deliberatally chosen timing.<br /><br />But well, history is a cycle of empires decaying and collapsing.
Comment1467	Cannot believe these people still don&#39;t have a country...
Comment 1467.1	@Mallakastra Jon√´ As Turks we gave lands to 37 country. We saved our own lands by losing 3,5 million people. At the same time we have kicked their asses.

Comment1473	We are not bombing kurds. Kurds live everywhere in Turkey also everybody is okay in our country. We are attacking terrorist group pkk. They are killing civilians and soldiers of Turkey at last 30 years. Turkey is NATO member and powerful allies of Usa. But usa betrayed Turkey. Usa giving them rockets ammunations and other things. All the nations trying Turkey push back from middle east because they are afraid for their policies and oils. We are Independet Country and We are defending our lands. If Kurds want indenpendence from north syria thy can discuss that problem with Syrian Goverment  after the syrian civil war. But they are not. They arent different from isis. pkk are killing babies, civil people. we will not allowed them. Our Father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk says &quot;Indenpendence or death&quot;. We will not give any lands from our Country.

Comment1475	To ensure the formation of an EU Army? or to deflect attention from somebody being impeached? Am unsure..will have to be a toss up...
Comment 1475.1	@Rahul Krishna eu population 700 million Russia 120million, usa 350million. only china has a large population around 1.1 billion, but china is 3rd world country outside of east coastal cites. and the yaun is worth 0.13 to the euro, so basicly nothing meaning in a long drawn out war china buying power will decrease faster, they could never afford the same level of technology or army sizes as European countries that are very wealthy per capita (which is really important not over all gdp).  eu has hundreds of small wealthy nations with different ecconamies and technologies. europe is very diverse and it is the richest Continent in the world. in war the eu would combined total strength and boost the overall buying power of the Continent.  usa is the only real contender here due to how wealthy they are (they can afford good technology and not mass junk like Russia and china, iraq showed what mas junk armies look like in a war against high tier armies). Russia is broke and basically a 3rd world country outside of Moscow and st petersburg. na a eu army with all of Europe&#39;s backing would be unstoppable. the only thing getting in the way is European morals and beliefs. but the threat of Russia and turkey could change that.
Comment 1475.2	@mark haynes üòÇ yeah okay. Bigger army than USA and China combined üòÇ. And also Russia
Comment 1475.3	and what is wrong with an eu army? someone scared that white Europeans are going to have an army bigger then china and the USA combined? and just as advance (in aviation even more so)? i know turkey will be scared. you will not be able to bully your neighbors anymore.
Comment 1475.4	Elaborate ?

Comment1479	Blood is on donnys hands.
Comment 1479.1	You were saying blood was on Americas hand for babysitting the primitives &amp; now you&#39;re upset because they leave
Comment1480	Lol maybe Turkey is bombing them because the kurds want to kill them.. Lol the kurds are not our friends.. They were the enemy of our enemy.. That&#39;s it.. We are going home.. Who cares what happens to them.
Comment 1480.1	PKK is a terrorist organization officially recognized by USA. Don&#39;t let YPG, SDF and all the other letter combinations confuse you. Their source is PKK. For getting involved into the Syrian Crisis while everybody was having a slice of cake USA decided to use YPG to clean out the formerly created ISIS. It&#39;s like pouring honey on all over the floor in disguise and then hiring a cleaning company when all the bugs reached to your set goal of territory. By doing so and using an letter combinations of PKK, USA also overcame the official recognition towards PKK in the past. To make them cuter they&#39;ve even added a &quot;democratic&quot; title to SDF &quot;Syrian Democratic Forces&quot; . I mean seriously? Separatist Kurds and PKK are one of the extreme Marxist Communism followers. They use to &quot;establish&quot; their state and attack to Turkish Armed Forces by using guerrilla tactics like Cuban guerillas till majority of them moved to Syria from Turkish mountains to operate there with higher chances to gain control of area during a civil war. I mean they even call their martyrs or soldiers guerrilla. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s democracy here. Even if it happens and a state gets established for them. They&#39;ll not be independent in this anti-communist USA domained world. They&#39;ll be puppets
Comment 1480.2	They are not Kurds <br />PKK and PKK are terrorists like ISIS

Comment1482	Since when establishing the stability in the border became killing Kurds? Those men are threat to all the lives in Turkey. They came from other countries, invaded North of Syria and became the direct neighbours with Turkey. Even the Syrian regime sees them as terrorists. Turkey says they will create a buffer zone to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks. If PKK terrorists want to live a couple of days more, they should leave the zone Turkey wants as the buffer zone.
Comment1483	president orange bag of fecal matter trump has a twin tower trump hotel in Istanbul Turkey that is more important to him than supporting the people who did the majority of fighting against ISIS and were our allies...The Kurds also have over 10,000 ISIS prisoners, but president orange bag of fecal matter trump is not worried about them escaping since they will all go to Europe...The US is currently being &quot;led&quot; by the most criminally corrupt government in its history...

Comment 1484.4	Policing over fighting is always better. America starts most of the conflicts since WWII and never finish or finish poorly twisting and manipulating to their advantage. Don&#39;t want to police - then stay out from the start.
