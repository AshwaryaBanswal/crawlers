Comment1	"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23liarborisI"">#liarborisI</a> don&#39;t care about Brexit. I&#39;ve wanted a progressive Labour government all my life. Today We have a Labour Party with a progressive left agenda. Like Bernie sanders in the USA, corbyn is a politician of and for the workers. Those of us who have not struggled as much as our fellow Britons need to show we are in solidarity with uber workers, Morrison workers, nurses, social and care workers and teachers who have seen their work load increase and their wages stagnant. I never trusted new labour with their income support provisions that put the burden on tax payers as opposed to big corporations. I have never seen the tories as a party of the majority, the tory government are composed of old moneyed mogg types who are averse to the unwashed masses, cruel traditionalists like D raab types, stupid chancers like javid and pritti, libertarian misfits like Boris and classical cons like may and Kenny. The lib  Dems are socially liberal so they like gays and blacks but not if they are too needy. The libs have their hands in the dirty business of neoliberalism which has caused the most destruction. You need only to look at the cruel voting record of its leader jo swinson and others to understand their feeling regarding the working poor and those on benefits. So in my humble opinion. We, the majority, have one chance of saving our nation and our humanity. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23votecorbyn"">#votecorbyn</a> because he wants to help us, all of us. He wants to turn our country into a beacon of hope it can be. A vote for Labour is a vote for a caring uk which treats all its citizens as equal, wanted, needed and essential. A Uk which gives a voice to all  its people. A green and bright United Kingdom."
Comment2	Hard Brexit now !   Time to permanently DEPORT this islamic terrorist pedophile hate clerica and 23.000 jihadists out of England.   Nigel Farage for Prime Minister. <br />Lets allow  white NON islamic immigrants to immigrate to England to save the white race.
Comment3	"This is what they said when they thought the referendum would get a remain result. Such liars.<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/Eu6PIUT8M-A"">https://youtu.be/Eu6PIUT8M-A</a>"
Comment4	Before the fixed term parliament Act this log jam would have been sorted out by a General Election, but HM Opposition are behind in the polls and are so blocking one. The behaviour of the Speaker and of many MPs is bad, considering Labour and Tory MPs were elected on a manifesto at the last General Election to honour the referendum result.  In previous years this kind of thing has been resolved by a General Election.  The behaviour of the House of Commons is wrong, given the promises that were made to the electorate both before and after the referendum result.
Comment5	He only knows Romans or Greeks - maby turkish. So what do you expect?
Comment6	cocaine sniffing ministers none are worth the air they breathe.
Comment7	Boris Johnson selling the UK into slavery to the mogrel dogs in Brussels and to the traitors who support the EU in the nation these are dogs.
Comment8	Sounds like his writers are straight out of Monty Python.
Comment9	Wasting time on the Brexit
Comment10	i know now  why  the mps still back   HS2  they want it built , for when the shit hits the fan    and they  will want to escape from  london .as quick  as they can .
Comment11	The EU should ensure that they offer an extended period if needed, otherwise, Boris Johnson will say that it was NOT offered to him and the ONLY way to implement a Brexit on the 31st October is to crash out without a deal! He can the squarely blame the EU for what has happened. EU do not fall into this trap!
Comment12	Take the deal the initial offering the sovereign UK offered is pretty generously humble tbh. Labour Party agreed on the result. [Deal+A] and [No Deal] are the only options forward. Where A asforementioned represents a bonded Amendment.
Comment 12.1	That said. The obvious focus is always bettering more than only the UK. Nothing wrong with celebrating UK sovereignty a little. The weave is out so... don‚Äôt be left on the left
Comment 12.2	"Moderator of good and impressive House of Commons acknowledged his legal responsibility to notify via pen and paper the Scottish and <a href=""http://n.irish/"">N.Irish</a> body which occurred and following a intense intelligent discussion it was passed as a UK unanimous decision to move it forward as the consensus decision and  then to address and fill in the details later. Changing clips doesn‚Äôt change history"
Comment 12.3	Paper and Pen evidence
Comment13	And the Tories keep going on dividing the UK further and further, year after year, with their big mouths trying to hide their incompetence.
Comment 13.1	@food4 thought Trump is a Republican. He&#39;s even worse than BJ, a criminal doing business with shady Russian oligarchs.
Comment14	I had hoped for a peaceful solution.  I fear there isn&#39;t one. <br /><br />Free Hong Kong. Free the UK.
Comment15	Working on Saturday means you get double pay when you look at the faces you can üòÇüòÅ see them taking the piss out üòÇ of use these MPS &amp; the Lord&#39;s need removing they just love the money which his a joke the little people work for less while this lot get fat üò† taking us all for fool&#39;s

Comment18	L would like to see corbryn working on a building site where he gets his hands dirty bet he as never üòÇ had a real job the only job he has is to go round the country to tell people how he loves the UK all the while being a good communist
Comment19	MP&#39;s who have integrity will represent the views of the constituents they represent. The other shallow and dishonest ones follow their own agendas and serve themselves, betraying the principles of our democracy. Their weasel words cannot excuse their actions.
Comment20	Why does he talk about working on a Saturday as if it&#39;s uncommon? Is he thick?
Comment21	"A very good case for Brexit:- <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WgVa3VRFb4"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WgVa3VRFb4</a>"
Comment22	The only hope is a no deal as what our PM is suggesting is not Brexit in any shape or form .
Comment23	I don‚Äôt mind if they come in every weekend like the rest of us
Comment24	An extension!?.. For what? To vote, vote and vote again on the same thing.. √† la May.. That‚Äôs the ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù we have - keep trying to vote on the same thing until you get the result you want.. FBS!
Comment25	"If you back Boris sign and share this <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/uk-parliament-let-boris-get-brexit-5f574402-fbae-4694-afc8-df4e39d8d38b"">https://www.change.org/p/uk-parliament-let-boris-get-brexit-5f574402-fbae-4694-afc8-df4e39d8d38b</a>"
Comment26	The revised treaty is nearly identical to May&#39;s treaty and puts Britain at the mercy of Brussels forever. Parliament are traitors and so is Boris despite his claims.
Comment27	THEY HAVE NOT UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS HUMANITY  IS FAST APPROACHING TO THE END OF IT&#39;S HISTORY.-- THEY SHALL NOT BE NO PEACE ANYWHERE IN ON THIS PLANET EARTH. UK WILL NEVER BEA UNITED COUNTRY ANYMORE. THE DAMAGE IS TOO DEEP AND DONE ALREADY.
Comment28	Yeeeeeeeyyyyyy.
Comment29	all the women to bojos left are always smiling....they love a bit of boris...i would love if boris just said &quot;look ffs i wasn&#39;t in power when the previous tory PMs destroyed this country, give me a chance ffs.
Comment30	Insufferable traitors to the once proud english nation. Oppossers of the deal, of brexit labour party, liberals and the like do not wish to exit the EU against the will of the people and so have no right to be in parliament as they are only serving their own interests.  I&#39;m quite sure they all have their own little EU houses in sunny Greece or Italy, or business practices abroad so are quite happy to betray the very people that gave them office. Shame.
Comment31	It&#39;s an awful deal. Nigel was right all along. Glad letwin&#39;s  amendment passed and I only hope bercow shelves this may 2.0 next week. This is not what I spent 3 years waiting for
Comment32	European union has once in life opportunity to evolve. UK is dieses. Get healthy as soon as possible EU.<br />üáÆüá∏üáµüá∞
Comment33	Amazing how the EU and America are coincidentally going through the same crisis at the same time. <br /><br />Is the western world getting better or worse? They seem to be so divided at a time when unity is the most common sence thing to do. <br /><br />A bit odd to see the west in such turmoil as China and Russia take the leading position in the world. <br /><br />Walls and tarrifs and immigration. This is huge on the world stage. The United kingdoms are falling down, right?
Comment34	WHY does there have to be a DEAL? Why can the people just LEAVE?! <br />I thought EUROPE&#39;S CITIZENS VOTED TO &#39;LEAVE&#39; the EU? I thought they had VOTED FOR BREXIT?! <br />Did I miss something?
Comment 34.1	You missed everythingÔºå and you will miss everything.
Comment35	Show them the turd üí© of a deal, bail out on 31. Brilliant. Get it done ‚úÖ
Comment36	Police escort mp scum home but very soon someone will get through and there will be bloodshed . They are begging for it .
Comment37	I voted leave and BJ deal is 95% the same as the Theresa Treasonous Incompetent Liar Kick The Can May‚Äôs. I now believe we the people should have a confirmation vote on any deal negotiated with the EU.<br /><br />The reason we now need a confirmation vote is we‚Äôre being railroaded into accepting something that is not in any shape or form what leavers like me voted for.<br /><br />On any new ballot paper it should have 1, Leave on WTO 2. Any Deal Negotiated 3. Remain anything less is being railroaded and conned. <br /><br />BJ is just another traitor and EU collaborator, he was given a chance and he‚Äôs blown it so he can expect to be the shortest serving PM in British history and can count on that come the GE
Comment38	VIEW FROM AMERICA <br />Huray for Boris . They were cheering . Three years is much too long . The vote was for Brexit , get it done .

Comment45	stop acting like you are saying &#39;i told you so&#39; when nothing has been done yet, you pleb.
Comment46	A very good speech of Boris Johnson in the parliament. He brought the deal, just vote now for Brexit . We in Europe are tired with your Brexit , just go now. People in UK voted for it so
Comment47	Boris RESIGN please....
Comment48	Keep up the good work MP‚Äôs your doing a brilliant job. I applaud you all for giving up a Saturday to do a job you were voted in to do which you clearly can‚Äôt do. <br /><br />Brilliant job at showing the public what a bunch idiotic, out of touch bags of air you truly are.
Comment49	Keep going Boris the british are behind you,all 17.4 million of them ,get us out
Comment50	In my personal opinion that man is a very good and charismatic speaker, and I sincerely mean that, but the problem being that deep inside you just have to be constantly aware that in fact he is a pathological liar.
Comment51	these remainers will end up like those protesters on the trains,couple of slaps!roll on.
Comment52	majority of the Englishman and woman serve in the army lives in the country side! those who shoot people abroad are people live in the country side those exact same people who doesnt want immigrant! who participate in destabilising other to cause poverty and rufugees etc are the same people living in the country side.
Comment53	Ffs no wonder Dianne Abbott slept all through this.
Comment54	REMOANER MP&#39;S DISGUST ME

Comment55	What is the cost for this brexit adventure so far? I hope it will last for another 3 years at least. Very entertaining to watch these inefficient clows. With love from Germany
Comment 55.1	leider zieht uns der Mist auch runter
Comment56	Boris is so full of crap. It&#39;s no wounder Trump likes him.
Comment57	Build a wall around the M25 and keep the a London Island to itself.
Comment58	Prime Minister, you must be kidding yourself but you are not kidding us. It is a bad &#39;treaty&#39; (not a deal)! You are backstabbing the loyal British citizens of Northern Ireland and making it more likely that pressure will be applied by the Nationalists to get a united Ireland. The referendum votes in the Province were weighted towards staying in the EU because the Nationalists (Republicans) wanted to remain and it is significant that a number of folk appeard to arise from the dead in order to vote (a common occurrence)! These folk give no allegience to Her Majesty or her Government yet sought to  use the referendum as a means to further their own ambitions. I believe that if you leave Northern Ireland in a different relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK, it will come back on your own head!
Comment59	Ted Heath TRICKED the UK electorate into joining the EEC ( Common Market ) back in 1973.<br />Then later on we had the European Parlament appear out of nowhere and WITHOUT A MANDATE FROM THE BRITISH PEOPLE.<br />WHY didn&#39;t we get a say on that?<br />We have been tricked and lied to and denied a vote on several occasions before.<br />This time we GOT a vote and certain people don&#39;t like it.

Comment62	Priti is dead sexy. I love it when she goes &quot; Urrrrrrrghhhhyeeeeaaaah!&quot;.

Comment64	When are the Mps  in the house of commons going to give the people what was voted for the outcome was leave ,but these Mps keep saying &quot;I DON&quot;T WANT TO LEAVE &quot; what do they mean &quot;THEY DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE&quot; its not up to them its what the people voted for that is democracy . these Mp&quot;s need to be sacked.
Comment 64.1	Just one word l to agree to that they don&#39;t understand the word leave all they understand his money
Comment65	British bullshit corporation.  And paedophile enablers
Comment66	The British government informs.<br />Parliament has betrayed the interests of Great Britain. Facebook rioting advertising is funded by Soros from abroad.<br />Elizabeth II is disappointed with British politicians and prosecutors.<br />October 31, hard Brexit. All other conversations in the status of an independent state.<br /><br />62% of Britons support Brexit without a deal with the European Union.<br />Go out and defend Britain! Give kulak traitors the face!<br />The London prosecutor&#39;s office is obliged to start checking why the referendum law in the UK is not implemented.
Comment 66.1	Do you even know the referendum law? Any referendum is purely advisory (not legally binding) and called by the government to see how the public feels about stated matter.
Comment 66.2	Source for any of that rubbish?
Comment67	I work every saturday, cant see why u cant boris
Comment68	no vote to all government when comes second referendum or general election. this is what they wanted and all of you fell for it, this entire government do not deserve our vote at all.
Comment69	As the descendant of Irish refugees, may I wish the Brits the best of luck with their upcoming famine.
Comment 69.1	@WasRemainNowLeave nah, I&#39;m alive.  Best of luck to you all though
Comment 69.2	Still playing the victim card?
Comment70	The traitors have spoken  and the puppet show continues  democracy is dead and the corruption continues  . They will do anything to remain  the lot of them needs replacing as soon as possible
Comment71	Parliament needs to be dissolved and prepare for general election.Let the people decide their future.
Comment72	Hopefully,  the EU will not grant an extension.
Comment73	I am french and agree english people to vote YES....know GET OUT.....OUT of ECC....that will be good for us....we do not need you......I am sorry for an inteligent part of this people who vote NO.....sometime the democracy has bad effect.....remenber !  Adolf Hitler has been democratically elected....stupid borris too
Comment 73.1	For the next 5 years or so all people who want to leave the UK should be free to do so and live here in the Eu again. If the young and qualified leave the island it... well, they would get what they deserve.
Comment74	BRINO
Comment75	It seems no matter what deal is put forward, it‚Äôs always voted against.
Comment 75.1	@Angel of Justice Which &quot;slimy tactics&quot; did the EU use?
Comment 75.2	@Angel of Justice Sure I&#39;m serious, the EU is highly democratic and very well organized. The downside is that it&#39;s complex and easily misunderstood.<br />In many ways, the democratic  procedures,  checks and balances are better than f.i. in the USA.
Comment 75.3	@ZorbaTheDutch You go tell that to the French right now i should know i live here and since 2005 when the french voted NO to joining the EU, and the EU used the same slimy tactics as they are using now on the UK they havent changed their ways at all ! They are a long long way from being democratic! it&#39;s more of a dictature as the french say it !
Comment 75.4	@ZorbaTheDutch &quot;&quot;&quot;The EU is the largest democracy in the world.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;üòÇ ü§£üòÇ ü§£ Are you serious ????   There is nothing democratic about the EU get your facts straight you fool !
Comment 75.5	@Angel of Justice The EU is the largest democracy in the world.
Comment76	oh no. They have to work on a Saturday.
Comment77	Many criticise and will continue to criticize BREXIT as a political crisis but to me it&#39;s a good thing, it taught the whole world some very good lessons, it&#39;s a reminder to the modern world how democracy really works. As a person who embrace democratic values, I respect UK people for its BREXIT referendum, I respect for the two prime ministers who has the guts to resign when they knew there own way is not working, I respect the Supreme Court&#39;s verdict on the suspension of parliament case. Even after more that 300 years since the Glorious Revolution, UK has a lot more to offer to other nations. You guys are making history here, godspeed UK stay strong
Comment78	Well, if this is not the end for the Tories then I don&#39;t know what else they have to do in order to wake up the electorate. Remember this clown with his we will walk away....oh yeah sell us down the river Boris. Don&#39;t worry the people will not forget come the next election. Mind you Corby is also a complete bullshitter.
Comment79	"t&#39;s very  simple   Boris . Decades of ani E.U tabloid propaganda, Dreams of a lost Empire  &amp; British  MEP&#39;s. doing fuck <a href=""http://all.to/"">all.to</a> promote British policies That&#39;s why there is no &#39;&quot;European feeling&#39;&quot; in England. ."

Comment81	Try having a part time job that pays 480 to have 300 deducted by the government 62 p in the pound and then get a council bill for 92 pounds the same month dorris...then tell me your life is difficult
Comment 81.1	@AuToTuNeDiN 6 You are correct.
Comment 81.2	@dragonfly6908 they are all as bad as each other the only honest politician is called a myth
Comment 81.3	@AuToTuNeDiN 6 You think that Labour, The Liberal Democrats and the rest don&#39;t claim expenses?.  Also there are more than a few Labour MP&#39;s who are millionaires, they are known as &quot;champagne socialist&#39;s&quot;.
Comment 81.4	@AuToTuNeDiN 6 My husband earns less than people on benefits which outside London is capped at ¬£20,000.
Comment 81.5	This isnt about brexit this is about keeping the scum tory party in power by any means..
Comment82	I&#39;ve been here before....Deja Vu,?
Comment83	I&#39;m going to try and visit England and see the sights before the chaos starts. I was able to do this by visiting Turkey and Egypt 20 years ago. You really can&#39;t do that now.
Comment 83.1	There literally won&#39;t be any change in your ability to visit the UK or see sights or whatever after Brexit, so don&#39;t worry too much about it. Also there won&#39;t be any of that &quot;chaos&quot; you speak of either life will still be as mundane and boring as it is, the only effects its gonna have is on businesses and how they do trade and stuff, the only real notice to the vast majority of people is a few price tags might change a little bit and thats about it.
Comment84	What happened to a nation that elects clowns as its representatives? He ain¬¥t saying anything. His deal is crap. But nobody cares, it¬¥s all about appearances. Appearances matter more that the actual reality. What¬¥s wrong with you?
Comment85	I am soooo devastated they had to work on a saturday!!!! Bloody useless, lazy over paid muppets! They are so removed from the real world and none are fit to hold position
Comment86	They all sound like sheep lol. yyyahahabaaaahhhhh. BbAAAAHHHHHH!!!! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAHBAAABABAAQQQWW!!!
Comment87	Legend

Comment91	Get Brexit done. The ‚Äòdone‚Äô part being the selling out of those who voted Leave. This will be addressed at the next GE.
Comment 91.1	Chiriac Puiu Brexiteers are laughed at not only in Europe, but internationally.
Comment 91.2	@Shinzo Shitititititoto You are on some crazy drugs. If people like you voted for Brexit then no wonder you are all laughed at by everybody in Europe (and taken advantage of by everybody else because of the pressure of a no-deal disaster). Ignorance is not an excuse for a decision that will destroy the future of the younger generation in the UK.

Comment92	These idiots couldn&#39;t agree on what day it is let alone get a BREXIT deal done. They have been working on a BREXIT deal for years with absolutely nothing to show for it! While these politicians grandstand and bicker with each other to further their political career, their constituents and country&#39;s industry go down the tubes. Nice job fellas! For once can you set aside your differences and do what&#39;s best for your Country?!
Comment 92.1	@LxÂåó No it&#39;s not. It&#39;s political grandstanding, and the people are getting tired of it.

Comment96	theresa may with a slightly deeper voice... what happened???
Comment97	He struck a deal that the people didn&#39;t vote for and expects people to trust in the deal he puts to parliament well good luck with that. Listen to the people they voted to leave the EU not remain with a deal!!
Comment 97.1	The voted to leave. The how was left out of it. If you wanted to leave your house, would just as happily jump out of the top floor window or rather exit through the door?
Comment98	Ignore those remainer crybabies Boris. Just let no-deal come to pass

Comment101	Brexit from the World Cup in Japan is Ireland&#39;s fate too

Comment104	from america, POWER TO THE PEOPLE! long stand the union jack!!
Comment 104.1	"@Jeff Lee No, I am not mad. In fact, you are the one who shoots constantly and talk something like &quot;yo Skippy, what happened to you?&quot;, &quot;you are going to let me beat up on your meth smoking buddies and not help them?&quot;, &quot;also where are you from there Skippy?&quot;. It is just pointless and stupid toxic.<br />Also, I live in Germany. The richest country in the EU and our maximum tax is at 42%. The &quot;50.7%&quot; is just a funny number and I don&#39;t know where you get that."
Comment 104.2	this is completely shocking at how many people are mad at me because i ithink people should run their own lives. this is completely unnatural, i literally can not believe what i am seeing here
Comment 104.3	@Tobi- 98 - also where are ya from there skippy?
Comment 104.4	@Tobi- 98 - college isnt free anymore. but it was when i went to school. and exactly what are you mad about there skippy? are you angry because i think the people should run their own lives instead of the government? and im not sure what ya mean about the tap water unless youre talking about michigan. other than that our water is the best around. so again, are you mad and attacking me and my country because  i believe the people should run their own lives?
Comment 104.5	"Oh really? So why need people decades to pay off their student loan if it is free?<br /><br />&quot;European highways actually carry more traffic and considerably heavier truck weights than U.S. roads, yet they are smoother and far sturdier. European highways are designed by their builders to last 40 years; the projected life of American roads is half as long&quot;<br />Just google &quot;roads in europe vs usa&quot; their are also some statistics.<br /><br />but i didnt even mean the roads. Lets start with: try to drink the water out of your water tap"
Comment105	It required a &quot;leap of faith.&quot;  Ms. Bourgeois Fame knows where to find her nobody prince.  She needed to take a leap of faith in order to meet her man who was waiting for her.  Everything unlocks because he&#39;s The Star of The Show.  The man is Brexit himself.
Comment106	Wish we have a character like trump in this country would straight all this out
Comment107	Brexit by now Romanians n all this shit from Eastern Europe out
Comment 107.1	yes , that ill change your life instantly wont it loser?
Comment108	Boris the Bullshitter.<br />Bullshitted everyone with the vote leave tripe, still bullshitting us as PM
Comment 108.1	YOUR RIGHT CHRIS. HE&#39;S GOT A BULLSHITTERS FACE AND BULLSHITTERS BRAIN................WHERE&#39;S IT GONE ! ! !
Comment 108.2	@Biffa Bacon i voted to leave for a reason, nothing to do with the lies and rubbish that they tried to bullshit everyone with.<br />As a country we should stand on our own feet and not take crap from the EU or anyone else.<br /> It could be so much worse, we could have corbyn as Europes puppet.
Comment 108.3	I doubt if anyone except a remainer would make you happy.<br />Boris is trying to implement what the people asked for, and that is Brexit.<br />It‚Äôs not a true departure from the EU, but it‚Äôs all he can do, as the tactical traitors have the numbers to outvote him.<br />Poor old remainers have no say in this, only in parliament.<br />If parliament defies the people, they will pay the price.<br />There are other parties waiting to take advantage in a General Election, and the two main players will fade away.<br />Most of the remain MPs will be unseated.
Comment109	What the fucks he talking about? Couldn&#39;t they put flat screens in there like they do in every pub all over the UK?
Comment110	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RINzMxMKeU&amp;t=2m21s"">2:21</a> This is proof enough that the UK should leave the EU. What Boris Johnson says here is completely accurate: Even those in favor of remaining have argued in completely practical terms. There is no love for the European Union. Those in favor are merely strategically in favor. That alone is reason to leave."
Comment111	Everyone hating on him for the dumbest shit,  listen to the words he‚Äôs actually saying. Maybe instead of insulting the people fighting for change and a deal you try could add constructive criticism, haven‚Äôt seen one comment building on something he‚Äôs said but I have seen loads of mocking. you say they are ones letting us down when we won‚Äôt even start a dialogue except that we are unhappy and have no interest in helping but only salting wounds.
Comment112	Friends I&#39;m from Ukraine and I have many indian friends ,,they call me and say &#39;&#39;tea is fantastic‚òï&#39;&#39; I asked them which tea,,they all replied me &#39;&#39;Sorry I&#39;m not supposed to tell you &#39;&#39;
Comment 112.1	@Peter Hruska I think your gand has been burnüòÇ‚òïüòÇ‚òï
Comment 112.2	makes no sense dude, please rephrase that
Comment113	UK who consider itself mother of freedom and democracy has become a joke in itself. Majority of Brits voted for BREXIT  but evil British govt keeps on delaying. Is democracy a joke? Shameless Britisher are liars and cheaters, making a mockery of itself.
Comment 113.1	@Jimmy Tighe just protest in millions to oust those going against the democracy. Dont let them undermine the decision of the majority. You mean if elected they will be allowed to become dictators? You have poor knowledge of rule of democracy. Kivk out those who are trying to undermine democracy, so what!even if they are elected.
Comment 113.2	@Tourdo ops how do we throw the opposition out when we have the fixed term parliament act meaning the only way to remove the opposition is for the opposition to remove themselves??? You need to actually learn how things work in our Parliament
Comment 113.3	@Jimmy Tighe lol...dont make excuses. People can easily throw those opposition out. The world already has impression that all Britishers have forked tongued and great liars. Dont prove them further, just kick out those people in opposition. They are making Britishers a greatest joke.
Comment 113.4	Its not the Government that is stopping us leaving it is the opposition.
Comment114	snakes
Comment115	Oh - Boris blah blah blah - how we like all wrong deals our governments! Boris is a dealer but the British people have to pay the price. I do not want a great deal. We want NO Deal!
Comment116	My right and left dishonourable thundercu.ts well done for doing a Saturday. You are now one step closer to understanding what a real worker normally works....ü§¨ good job they can sit down because they will need a week off for doing a Saturday... belters! <br /><br />Rant over: moving on....get it done!
Comment117	So , yet again, the traitors in the house are abusing their powers by voting to delay Brexit, until all the laws they concocted have been set in place.<br />It‚Äôs like giving the criminal in the dock, the power to change the laws that he has just broken.<br />This country is now in the deepest shit, in its political history.<br />‚ÄúCromwell‚Äù, the film of the man himself, shows exactly how this  self serving , arrogant , most corrupt parliament is acting.<br />Oliver Letwin is just another name to add to the list of disgraceful politicians, who will have to answer with his seat.<br />The so called ‚Äúmother of all parliaments‚Äù, is now the most shameful of all parliaments.<br />A bloody disgrace.
Comment118	Im 25 years old in the prime of my life and I need to work every friday and saturday night graveyard shifts just to live. These people are insufferable and should be to all common men.
Comment 118.1	@G M Of course, a larger slice of the pie that I myself make for my employer. I know exactly how many thousands of dollars I make my employer on each night and how little I am paid in comparison to that number. But that wasnt my point here, im not the exception, they are the lazy asses getting paid too much for too little with all the wrong qualifications.
Comment 118.2	So do you think you DESERVE more money or something?.. And if you do, why?.. And where is the money gonna come from?
Comment 118.3	MrLoobu just pray labour don‚Äôt get in and raise your tax to 36%
Comment119	I wish Ireland would leave the EU. Place is full of social welfare tourists from Africa and Eastern Europe. They bring nothing to the country and don&#39;t integrate at all. Meanwhile our native population have emigrated to the four corners of the world to make a living. I was never a racist bigot but I&#39;m fast turning into one. Fuck the EU, Merkel and open borders. I want my country back.
Comment120	The people‚Äôs soul has been taken never to return! Now it‚Äôs your turn to reap the Wrath of your greedy actions, you will be eaten from the inside out,never to return. SAD BRITAIN,SAD. TRUTH.
Comment121	Letwin amendment result.Another disgraceful attempt to stop brexit.All those who voted for should hang their heads in shame for again going against the wishes of the people who voted out.Letwin should be ashamed of what he has done.
Comment 121.1	Wherever you stand on the debate, it is disgraceful to put forth such an amendment so close to the 31st. He should be removed in a by-election immediately.
Comment122	BORIS IS THE GREATEST PRIME MINISTER SINCE CHURCHILL
Comment 122.1	@AuToTuNeDiN 6 We are at war with the dirty liberals
Comment 122.2	Churchill tbf was a step up from what we had before him, it was allot like the Americans in 2016, voting for Trump over Hillary is like voting for someone to shit into your ear instead of into your mouth
Comment 122.3	Churchill was only a good wartime priminister a bumbling fool when not in  war, I see your point
Comment 122.4	Churchill destroyed Britain . If i had money , i would leave this shithole.
Comment 122.5	We haven&#39;t had a decent once since Cromwell
Comment123	Let us nail the lie that Parliament is Sovereign chanted by the likes of Gina Miller who does not know let alone understand English Constitutional Law.  Here are the facts on the 8th March 1784 during the reign of King George I Parliament voted on the question of Sovereignty and voted it rest with the Monarch. The Monarch is the guardian of it for us the People and our Oath system is all based on it. English Constitutional Law is clear no one not even the Monarch can give our Sovereignty over to a Foreign State. People in Parliament are committing High Treason.
Comment124	My opinions on Brexit have flip-flopped  all over place over these last few years and somewhere along the line I somehow became a communist but I think I speak on behalf of all British people when I say that this farce has gone on long enough, if you want a second referendum then give us a second referendum, if you want a no deal exit give us a no deal exit, if you want some shitty deal give us a shitty deal, if you want to remain then remain at this point I couldn&#39;t care less, we have plenty more important things to discuss and problems to address than Brexit, just get this shit done and get it done yesterday, we&#39;re sick of it.
Comment125	Teresa&#39;s deal was better. Boris should resign.
Comment 125.1	Neil Kinnock and his wife did very well financially out of the EU, you can read how well on the internet.  Maybe this is why their Labour MP son Stephen wants to stay in the EU.  üòÆüòÆüòÆ

I sincerely hope that the UNdemocratic , dishonest , corrupt MPs get absolutely annihilated at the next election , off the gravy train and on the dole .

Comment133	We&#39;re screwed if this pases no Deal
Comment 133.1	Why? We keep our 38billion and as currently the second largest contributor to the eu it makes sense for the eu to come knocking.

Comment153	If only he had written the speech himself, but you just know his minions wrote it for him because there is no waffling jibber jabber in it.
Comment 153.1	Leaders including Presidents of the USA, rarely write their own speeches.  They don‚Äôt have the time and instead employ speech-writers to do it for them.
Comment 153.2	Jacob Rees moggs work I reckon
Comment 153.3	@Nathaniel Lake and that&#39;s why we are where we are cos nobody gives two shits if a privileged private school educated person speaks someone  else&#39;s words but is only saying those words to feather his own nest. But dont worry he will change his mind tomorrow.
Comment 153.4	simon kimber who gives two shits, it‚Äôs the words that matter not who wrote them. It‚Äôs a political party and he is the leader so it‚Äôd only be right that even speeches assembled by multiple members should still be voiced by him.

Comment 174.1	It&#39;s why his wife locked him out of the house, then divorced him.
Comment175	I want to know if we will still paying into the EU ??? And how much ???
Comment 175.1	Supposedly Britain is going to give 33billion¬£ as apart of withdrawal deal. <br />Thats alot of money to hand out especially during this recession.
Comment 175.2	@RAGSTAluvsDA90z  no it&#39;s more complicted, after the 31st there is a transition period (1?2?3?10 years?) and UK will continue payng FULL membership every year to have access to EU. so NO on the 1 st of november with this deal NOTHING  will change ( including free movement )
Comment 175.3	Payments of Divorce Bill and the UK military defence

Comment 176.1	Housed a bunch of freemasonry pedo rings for years full of evil. Yer fantastic place.
Comment 176.2	The House is fine, it&#39;s the Muppets inside it!
Comment 176.3	Here in America we are all on our roller skates with sparklers in hand awaiting your decision.
Comment177	Boris Johnson you are a dishonest man <br />You use liars to convince people to vote yes for BREXIT <br />You created all this confusion because of personal ambition <br />You don&#39;t have any single love for your country
Comment 177.1	@RAGSTAluvsDA90z And then we can have Jeremy &quot;on the fence&quot; Corbyn, Jo Swansong and Anna Sourbry, i am sure they will all get on.
Comment 177.2	This is why he will resign after this

Comment 179.4	Lol delete this comment
Comment180	By the end of day, the PM will be ordered by MPs to seek for an extension, likely.
Comment 180.1	But we won&#39;t be forced into an extension, the EU members won&#39;t accept there will be at least one veto. We will be leaving on the 31st without a deal.
Comment181	I don&#39;t care for semantics. I want the details.  If EU are happy we have been compromised.
Comment 181.1	@Fingers don&#39;t you like my duck face  pose?  Lol. Silly Billy.  You&#39;re emotionally leaking.
Comment 181.2	Pretty sure almost everyone is happier than you. Sad looking little person
Comment182	So out of touch, they‚Äôd be all fucked if they did 40-50 hour a week Manuel labour jobs
Comment183	No deal followed by the immediate breakup of the corrupt BBC.
Comment 183.1	Because it is a publicly funded national media broadcaster, it has a duty to be balanced, fair and impartial but it is not . It is a far left political propaganda machine
Comment 183.2	@Auf dem Laufenden It has a very specific agenda, the socialists and right liberals hate them equally, also TV liscence collection is like a racket and prominent BBC officials have a nasty habit of getting caught using taxpayer money to fuck kids
Comment 183.3	Why corrupt? I am from Germany so please explain
Comment184	I just focus on his hairstyle..how about you, folks..
Comment 184.1	Gombal Mukiyo72  What hair STYLE ?
Comment 184.2	@Nathaniel Lake I recognize you as a brexiter then..
Comment 184.3	Gombal Mukiyo72 maybe if you focused on the words you‚Äôd actually get something out of the video besides labour level childishness
Comment185	We want our transport back too.
Comment186	WTF, you were doing so well and now gone and sold us out. This is Brexit in name only, it&#39;s been 3 years and this is the best you can come up with?

Comment 186.4	He hasn&#39;t been Prime Minister for 3 years. He&#39;s been Prime Minister for a few months. What are you talking about?
Comment187	"If you want to see what you will face with Brexit - take a look at this: <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/brexit"">https://www.gov.uk/brexit</a><br />People may have voted for leaving the EU - but they were seriously misled about what the consequences would be.<br />Go to the website - and weep."
Comment188	üëû
Comment189	Boris Johnson got a slick tongue though still talks in Babylon riddles. The way forward will always be unity and that goes far beyond EU, far beyond any border or division. Each one teach one, life is ‚ù§Ô∏è, the world one great university. No human is lesser important, we don&#39;t need a government, we just need evolution of consciousness, blessed love and Iness ‚ù§Ô∏è‚òÄÔ∏èüåç‚úä
Comment190	We have a debt rising at ¬£95,000 a minute ALL this is &quot;Alice in wonderland&quot; bollocks. The simple fact is the world is on the brink of another banking financial crisis, they are just holding it off long enough to blame the brexit result. The government will only be using money that does NOT exist as our debts have risen by at least ¬£10 million listening to half this video.
Comment191	Obviously, they will note no yet again, Boris will request &quot;some time&quot; from the EU, maybe a week. Seems like the EU has to do Parliament&#39;s job. <br /><br />Good one, Parliament, you prefer no deal.
Comment 191.1	@Darren Murphy Bullshit, it&#39;s not the EU, it&#39;s 100% the UK.  People were told that Brexit will be all sunshine and double rainbows... and the old ppl believed all of that crap and voted against the will of the younger generation. The UK deserves this shit show.
Comment 191.2	EU are the ones making things difficult, through their English political counterparts
Comment 191.3	HunterShows there will be no deal but boris will request an extension or risk jail
Comment192	NHS gets all of its meds from Europe, getting the same things from America, isn&#39;t surrendering the NHS at all. Changes nothing, think politicians need to stop over thinking and feeling they need to have a say on everything because they think because of the position, they have a valid say on everything. Without realising they&#39;re causing delays and causing a rift between sides. <br /><br />I&#39;ve said for nearly decade that Boris will be prime minister, I think he&#39;s a baffoon but he is a leader and can reunite nations.<br /><br />Corbyn on the other hand is a disgrace and only has his motives at heart, Corbyn is disgusting and a danger. <br />&quot;I will not do a deal with America or trump&quot;<br />Polite notice! It isn&#39;t what you want, its what the nation wants that matters...if the nation voted leave, then we damn well leave.<br />If the nation wants a deal with the biggest economy the planet has ever seen, then that&#39;s what the nation gets!<br />Absolute moron of a politician
Comment 192.1	@BasterMater5000 well it seems to work well here in Australia and we are further away than the UK
Comment 192.2	The difference is medication from the US costs considerably more.<br /><br />Secondly you can&#39;t import many drugs that distance because they have short half-lives.
Comment 192.3	@Paul Patterson sounds to me that wages need to be capped. Seems to me no matter where u place a human, were always gonna take the piss with liberties.
Comment 192.4	I worked in the NHS for years in IT projects and I can categorically say that money and more importantly time is pissed up the wall. Entire departments are ran like little fiefdoms, Chief execs promoting their wives and their bits of fluff into positions nearing six figure salaries based on 0 skill. It is dire need of privatisation.
Comment 192.5	Also.. People hold the NHS up like some &quot;sacred cow&quot;... It&#39;s not... It&#39;s just a service(and a very flawed one at that).
Comment193	A daugther of immigrants behind him....kkkkk... smiling and agreeing  with every rubbish boris&#39; thoughts....kkkkkk...hilarious!!!!<br />It&#39;s like the shit that&#39;s happening here Brazil!!!!...kkkkkk
Comment 193.1	@„Ç∏SenpaiScape What is happening there is not just about british stuffs and immigrants...is much more than that!!!<br />Anyway, we have to pay for our choices...Cheers
Comment 193.2	Kalel Juc√° are you implying we are completing closing the borders to immigrants? Cause I don‚Äôt think that is would happen.
Comment 193.3	@Jim Raza Her parents(maybe yours, by your name) came there, coz, through the history, Brits(not just them) have been putting their noses in foreign lands to get some sort of advantages, and, of course, that would have consequencies...<br />Anyway, we&#39;re making a fuss for some obvious &quot;Trump, Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon&quot; &#39;reasons.... Cheers, Mate!!!!
Comment 193.4	@Kalel Juc√° Her parents came here when the country needed labour and immigration was controlled. What we have now is practically an invasion of Eastern Europeans forced on us by the EU.
Comment 193.5	@Jim RazaSo...following your thought...what is she doing there?!!! This sort of rubbish thought has been spreading all over the western world!!! Extreme right shit!!! Too shallow...lullaby to move on this conversation!!!
Comment194	Who else is distracted by Priti Patel snug entitled face...if anyone was ever named ironically it would be her
Comment 194.1	Mark Smith a smug little snake
Comment 194.2	It&#39;s not an Irish border that we have in Ireland it&#39;s an English border
Comment195	Should have sat in the Summer, but all this is due to them pissing off in July
Comment196	&quot;A delay would erode public trust&quot;...In Boris, because he&#39;s made promises his ass can&#39;t keep.
Comment197	When can we start hearing about an American trade deal? If you want to unite people, give them something to focus on perhaps?
Comment 197.1	@Mykinc Adult-Toys Actions matter as you say. Like Trump naming a race of people rapists and criminals, stoking up fear and anger, offering a solution by building a wall, and then not building a wall. Please don&#39;t justify the racism, fear mongering and abject political failure of this pussy grabber.
Comment 197.2	@fricozoid1 well I don&#39;t agree with him on everything, but I think he can be easily misunderstood. He has a mindset, it&#39;s definitely isn&#39;t malicious in nature. Perhaps a little overly dominant. He&#39;s passionate about his country. He isn&#39;t afraid to say no. And he speaks his mind.<br />And the grab&#39;em by the pussy line was really a private &quot;haha&quot; joke between to adult men. That got manipulated into a bigger thing mainstream media, in order to effect his campaign.<br />We all say things we perhaps shouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s not what we say, it&#39;s what we do that matters Imo

Comment203	The big quote for the history books &quot;In any future trade negotiations with any country, our National Health Service will not  be on the table&quot; - Boris Johnson 19/10/19
Comment 203.1	He is a compulsive liar that is beyond dispute &amp; cannot be defended, his own family can‚Äôt trust him, his own party can‚Äôt trust him, the EU negotiators can‚Äôt trust him, the electorate can‚Äôt trust him. All politicians are economical with the truth, but Johnson just cannot tell the truth, workers &amp; consumer rights will be eroded over time just as the NHS will be sold off to big American corporate health providers. The electorate can stop it, whether they have the will is another question.
Comment 203.2	It obviously isn&#39;t true but whatever gets the bourgeois parliament to talk about anything else, at least when our relationship is clear we will know exactly which threats our public services will face and can organise accordingly

Comment206	Eating popcorn and watching episode 1212 of the Brexit soap opera.

Personally I wish you the best success, successful neighbors makes for a nice neighborhood.<br /><br />But there is not a doubt in my mind that this has been bad. I still get confidential recruitment calls from companies looking to relocate from UK to Sweden, huge companies.<br /><br />So thanks for the business I guess.

Comment207	Personally, I would have liked to have seen an extension just long enough for the new EU rules on tax havens to come into force, to see which politician is actually thinking of the country and which is thinking of only themselves. I&#39;m sure that revelation would be an eye opener for many. Regardless of whether you voted remain or leave. Nevertheless, it is time to put Brexit to bed and move on.
Comment 207.1	Welcome to leave, if it goes tits up for anyone leaving the United Kingdom. Your on your own. I don&#39;t believe the United Kingdom should care for anyone that wants to turn their back on us.

Comment211	It will be half a country when it gets smaller when Scotland  goes
Comment 211.1	@Biffa Bacon London subsidises the rest of England. Look at tax receipts. Maybe this way you&#39;ll understand how it is to be on the receiving end of (your) insults.<br />&quot;I don‚Äôt care about fiscal this and that.&quot; - wow, are you so uneducated that you don&#39;t even know what fiscal means!?
Comment 211.2	Jojo Chen <br />Oh dear, you really don‚Äôt get it.<br />Just for starters, London is subsidised by the whole country, hardly the other way around.<br />Scotland is not an independent country, and that is a fact. I don‚Äôt care about fiscal this and that.<br />It abides by the rules of the union, not by its desires to be independent.<br />Your arguments are based on ifs and buts, and not on the basic fact that it is part of the U.K.<br />When we have finally left the federal state of Europe, Scotland can re apply to join.<br />They have little hope of succeeding, without holding the hand of England, and those scroungers from the North.<br />Scotland is another one of those countries that wants all the benefits, but has very little to give in return.<br />You put a spin on every comment , and now resort to insulting the English people , without whom , London would not exist.<br />Full of immigrants , coming to this country to suck it dry.<br />Get those border controls in place, the sooner the better.
Comment 211.3	"@Biffa Bacon OK, let&#39;s continue your reasoning for a sec. North England has a bigger fiscal deficit than Scotland [1]. And as a Londoner I&#39;ve got to subsidise these numpties in the North who voted Brexit.<br />Even worse, Boris is promising them a huge spending boost because Brexit causes so much damage to their manufacturing.<br />I&#39;m not having that. Northerners should suffer their self-inflicted pain.<br />Let&#39;s have an independent London, finally unshackled from these English deadweight simpletons surrounding us.<br /><br /><br />Oh, and the deficit statistics you cite on Scotland are highly questionable. There simply isn&#39;t the data to know how an independent Scotland would fare.<br /><br /><br />[1] <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/23/uk-budget-deficit-grows-to-more-than-10bn-as-people-spend-less"">https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/23/uk-budget-deficit-grows-to-more-than-10bn-as-people-spend-less</a>"
Comment 211.4	Jojo Chen <br />Despise ?<br />I don‚Äôt despise, anyone.<br />I‚Äôm explaining to you that Scotland has no rights to it‚Äôs independence, as far as Brexit goes.<br />When it‚Äôs over, I would support the Scottish breaking away from the U.K.<br />That‚Äôs what they want, they just don‚Äôt have any more rights than  England does to an independent referendum on Brexit.<br />They aren‚Äôt of any value to the EU without being tied to the UK, as apparently the deficit to GDP is 10 cent, and the max required by the EU for membership is 3 per cent.<br />They only qualify when tied to the U.K.....as I said , <br />Dead weight......
Comment 211.5	@Biffa Bacon As you despise Scotland and Scottish people so much, why aren&#39;t you happy if Scotland breaks away from the UK?
Comment212	Boris Johnsons deal is not brexit its Theresa Mays surrender deal repackaged.

Comment213	French is rejoicing with this new agreement with Boris.  If they are rejoicing it can not be good for the UK. I think it is a terrible mistake to rush this vote without looking at the detail of this text and reflect properly.   People are fed up but the may well be also terribly screwed after today and for a long time to come.
Comment 213.1	Why do you think France is your enemy?
Comment214	Love or hate him, that was one brilliant speech.
Comment215	Here here! Brilliant speech and the best prime minister we have ever had second only to Churchill. This vote can only go two ways; 1, the remainers and the traitors will lose their nerve and fold like a cheap suit to vote for the deal to try to save their jobs come the next general election. Or 2, the same people will still be traitors and thier lust for money and power will make them vote down or distain from voting. We all know that at least 100 MPs are the EUs pocket, so I hope the deal gets voted down so the glorious and best no deal will happen, WTO is the only way.
Comment 215.1	Because Churchill made the UK win WWII, and BJ has.. er... er...  er...
Comment 215.2	@Declan Manning Yes I believe in the one and only God of the Bible. I know who your god is. Do you?
Comment 215.3	@Giving You The Facts Ministries , do you actually believe in a God Jamie?
Comment 215.4	@Aswayne Locks Exactly, he&#39;s only been the PM for 5minutes and achieved the biggest and most important democratic exercise since world war two, he&#39;s not just stood there with his tail between his legs and cowardly listening to the EUs demands like Teresa May did. He fought back and got us out of the deep hole we were in. This deal isn&#39;t perfect but he&#39;s shown that he can do the impossible. The EU, Teresa May and labour said it was impossible to renegotiate the deal but he did. Now he will take us all out of the EU without a deal which is perfect, a clean slate and a chance for the UK to think for itself to bigger and better than the EU. Who else has done any better? Would Jeremy Corbin, no.
Comment 215.5	@Giving You The Facts Ministries the guy has been PM for 5minutes and still has got Us out of the EUü§îü§î what did he achieve so far

Comment 216.3	@Dylan Murphy You&#39;re acting as if you have, judging from how angry your responses are... perhaps have a look back over what you have wrote sunny Jim :P

Comment223	you cannot trust this clown act, he went to DUP conference and looked them in the eye and told them, he would not put a border in the irish sea, and he was fated as a hero<br />today with this very bad deal stabbed them in the back
Comment 223.1	@rapier1954 Farrell the EU are the ones who pushed this backstop to overshadow the brexit phenomenon, the sovreign taking back their sovreignty from the multinational nwo machine
Comment 223.2	@Darren Murphy I think this backstop business is gone. Whether the border would be fully militarized I have no idea. But a No Deal Brexit would mean customs checks and that would create tremendous delays and there would be added duties etc and all that could kill cross border trade or at least mess it up badly. Some businesses now do a high percentage of their business on the other side of the border and those businesses may not survive. At least that is what some of the owners claim. Some of the owners claim they are making over 10 trips a day back and forth imagine if you had to go through customs checks of some sort in that case !! Nobody knows how a No Deal Brexit would look like on the Irish border. A leap in the dark.
Comment 223.3	@Ed Devlin it was the skilfull twisting of words and opinions what got Ireland into the EU mess in the first place, the last proper government Ireland had was formed in 1916, and subsequently sold down the river by successive governments, politicians from cork and Dublin are both responsable for that atrociously sweet deal handed to the EU for a bit of Monopoly money.<br /><br />That prick ends Kenny only set it up for varadkar he is only a yes man for the eu.<br /><br />Also religion has been all but forgetting by modern society thanks to all the shit they done in Ireland and all over the world coming to surface, the church had serious power in Ireland for years and I&#39;m sure they also had a hand in turning northern Ireland into a war zone, Maggie tatcher was no saint either but politics and religion just like work and pleasure, should never mix
Comment 223.4	@rapier1954 Farrell I tend to agree with you there, I can&#39;t see the troubles as they were, returning, I would hope that a United Ireland does happen, then we can start negotiating our own release from the clutches of the EU<br /><br />The things that would happen in a hard border would be militarisation of the border, and business&#39;s relying on both sides of the border would be adversely affected, does anyone even know what the backstop is?
Comment 223.5	Debbie Lough  No shame in being young, it was your generation n the one before which created that situation.
Comment224	I&#39;d just love to see Boris continue his losing streak in Parliament. It&#39;s great to see a public liar publicly humiliated. Nothing he vouches for in his deal can be trusted anyway!
Comment 224.1	@Jess√© Middleton „ÉÑ<br />No, i mean the people will allow it at the upcoming general election of reckoning, if you manage to defeat democracy and hold the UK captive in the EU.
Comment 224.2	@Anonymous Good luck with that. As if the Parliament will allow a disastrous &quot;no deal&quot;. üôÑ
Comment 224.3	Oh you want No Deal too? Cool, so do i actually!
Comment225	free northern ireland....now is the time....
Comment 225.1	Dylan Murphy There will be no budget. The northern oil is running out, the financial firms will reallocate their headquarters, students will no longer be attracted by Scottish universities as they will then have to pay the tuition fee. There will be no wealth for the nation, and Scotland will be poor.

Comment 226.4	@rational conservative If you are going to call someone an imbecile, make sure you spell &#39;you&#39;re&#39; correctly. Your point of view will carry a little more weight. As it stands, ybor20 is probably correct. So far, for all of Boris&#39; faults, we can&#39;t accuse him of attempting to blackmail Presidents of other countries for electoral gain. As for hating &quot;establishment politicians&quot;, that I can understand. However, I cannot understand electing someone who clearly has zero understanding of how international organisations work and operate. I will remind you of the time that the General Assembly of the United Nations laughed at your president. Far from making your country great (I won&#39;t add &#39;again&#39; as you never have been), he has made you a laughing stock. Throwing your question back at you, I ask why can&#39;t Trump supporters understand this? Your country with its present leadership is a joke. Not only a joke but untrustworthy, hypocritical and on top of all that, you betray allies on the battlefield. How dare you call someone an imbecile when you claim to be a Trump supporter.
Comment 226.5	@rational conservative beside  a &quot;rational&quot; &quot;conservative&quot; is a contradictio in terminis, its means that you even do not understand your own chosen name.
