Comment10	Guess what? Democracy has failed in HK.<br />The only thing works is FreeDOOM Fighters which rules HK.
Comment 10.1	@John Koh I&#39;m going to backtrack a bit and say you&#39;re right, HK never had the right to govern themselves when it was a colony, partially because that&#39;s how colonies work. You know whats also true? The people don&#39;t have the right to elect their own Chief Executive either.<br /><br /><br />Hk is part of China, except it&#39;s &#39;one country, two system&#39;. Chapter 1, article 5 of the Basic Law, quote &#39;The socialist system and policies shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years.&#39;<br /><br /><br />Not even going to discuss Singapore because that&#39;s straying way too off topic.<br /><br /><br />It&#39;s an entire staff of the bookstore that got abducted by Chinese authority, of which one was forced to admit his &#39;crimes&#39; on CCTV.
Comment 10.2	@LokYin Yun<br />You fail to admit Britain had never given HK freedom to govern themselves for 150 years. Your Hypocrisy is obvious.<br />You fail to recognise the fact HK is part of China. I suppose You never read history book. <br />Democracy fails in HK, one good example is where rich capitalism prevails as 4 filthy rich HK families control much of HK land bank. HK people get use to living in cages since the British rules. <br />Whereas Singapore LKY, a socialist authoritarian &amp; critic of democracy, implemented undemocratic policy to ensure youths can afford housing. He controls western news, freedom of speech, locked up &amp; banish political dissidents. Yet Singapore thrives despite being undemocratic.<br />I thought HK book seller is nothing but a opportunist to defame Chinese leader. BTW, Who will buy his story?
Comment 10.3	@John Koh I love how this discussion of &#39;democracy has failed in HK&#39; took a sharp turn to &#39;list all the bad things colonialism does&#39;, but sure, I will continue.<br /><br /><br />There&#39;s no need for locals to get involved when the governor is implementing policies that benefit the people. Stuff like education and housing. Don&#39;t play identity politics with me. It&#39;s only after the handover that every CEs have attempted to assimilate the future generation to the mainland, and not fully addressing the needs of the people. <br />Did the rioters care when they plant bombs and killed innocent people, including children, or state media threatening an invasion? Or that time militia across the border shot and killed police officers?<br />Again, it&#39;s hell of a luxurious slavery when the people are enjoying all the perks of a first world nation.<br />Also, universal suffrage is promised in the Basic Law of HK. <br />Freedoms taken by China? Gee I don&#39;t know, but is &#39;kidnapping and convicting booksellers selling books party officials don&#39;t like one of them?&#39;
Comment 10.4	@LokYin Yun<br />Did Britain give any minister posts, senior government position &amp; governor post to HK people?<br />Did British care about HK when they shot at rioters?<br />1982? Too little too late after 150 years of slavery. <br />China &amp; HK government are too kind to give Hkroachs a second chance. <br />The fact remains the same, it is a Quasi-constituitional government just in case you don&#39;t agree. <br />Name those freedoms taken by China?
Comment 10.5	@John Koh &#39;China allows HK...govern themselves&#39; Um, not quite. It was the Sino-British joint declaration. <br />&#39;Britain never given them freedom to govern themselves&#39; There were local elections as back as 1982. Also, the colonial government back then did a fairly good job in turning a city prosperous and free.<br />&#39;150 years slavery&#39; We had uncensored internet, freedom of the press, wealth and got to see the world, while across the border intellectuals are sent to work in farms and landlords murdered. So I&#39;ll say there&#39;s quite a big hole in your cage.

Comment12	Well done. He should have bitten his neck!
Comment13	We support freedom, democracy for HongKong ü§ùüí™
Comment14	Funny how people who call themselves ‚Äúprotesters‚Äù have all the rights to stab and shoot, and yet still be cheered up after. While the ‚Äúpolices‚Äù are blamed  for force reactions, even those reactions might only be for self-defense.
Comment 14.1	&#39;all the right to stab and shoot&#39; Give me an example of a protester shooting someone.<br />Also the police lobbing tear gas at journalists or into people&#39;s home is sure as sh*t not self defense.
Comment 14.2	You assume he was a protester! Yet he attacked a pro-democracy councillor, Andrew Chiu.<br />And I notice that SCMP has neglected to mention he is a democrat.
Comment15	The order of event....protests lawful or unlawful, riot after set-up road blocks, smash and set fire to shops,   enter shopping mail to hide,  riot police respond!!  Stop mess around with words and order of event!!
Comment16	A pro-democracy leader got one of his pro-democracy ears bitten off. How painful!
Comment17	I am really praying that Hong Kong officials politicians can bring negations to their young people that will end this desperate situation
Comment18	Sad case
Comment19	fuck all those chinese and free Hong Kong Shi is a mo fu
Comment20	Free scotlandÔºÅ
