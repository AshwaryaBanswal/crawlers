Comment1	Volume is low, üò¢
Comment2	FWIW: 18&quot; uplift @jellystone
Comment3	Haywood is way over due. slip slide n frack..how insane..
Comment4	Could it be possible that the usgs is being manipulated in some manner ?
Comment5	I‚Äôm wondering what is the depth measurements of the active volcanoes that have erupted what is the longitude latitude vis-√†-vis the earthquakes
Comment6	El Mirage was closed 4 days ago due to water?, I checked yesterday and open?  Where did water come from/go ?  Yes 86 miles far away, ideas?
Comment7	Any Pumis along the Cali. Coast lately?
Comment8	Drill points make me think of the 6 Cities recently showing HIGH METHANE, sewage is used to fill these fracking holes. Humans do produce methane in our poo,like farting the gases have to rumble through to escape out a weak spot. Pressure moves the plates along with gases,magma etc. Its all coming to a point,volcanoes are proof.
Comment9	I was explaining to a former Clifornian who was now my neighbor in Tornado Alley, what to do in case of a tornado. Her response was, &quot;oh, like an earthquake &quot;.  Therefore, we all need preps, even if we don&#39;t live in an earthquake zone.
Comment10	WHAT DOES THE NASA KNOW THAT WE DONT---  STEVE QUAYLE REPORTING ON LISA HAVENS REPORT.   on 07/29/2019   NASA planes scanning of San ANDREAS,  Ridgecrest/ china lake MAGMA ready to exploden whithin 90 days.   Cascadia  more of a danger than Yellowstone .  BOISE IDAHO  crater of the moon-  12 active volcanoes 200-300 miles west of Yellowstone.  CASCADIA MORE OF A THREAT THAN YELLOWSTONE.
Comment11	I am concerned that USBS is also messing with the depths. When you have a couple deep ones and suddenly all around them is 6.2 I don&#39;t think so
Comment 11.1	Congratulations! You&#39;re now in the Dutchsinse Posse for Seismic Truth
Comment12	Thank you so very much Copper for all that you do.  I hope that all is well with you and that you and your family are staying healthy.  Dutch, thank you for your reports, forecasting,vigilance in observation  and being a watchman.  Thank you Duchess for allow Dutch the time to do his reporting.  Hope that you are doing well dear lady. Dutch found a jewel when he met you.  May all of Dutch and Copper‚Äôs moderators and followers stay healthy.
Comment13	This is why we question the professionals, and why do we call them professionals because they are supposed to know what they are doing, NOT
Comment 13.1	I am sure they know WTH is going on but bet they get bigger pay checks to lie about everything...
Comment14	Hello from Belgium! Question, with all of the permafrost that is melting around the globe, doesn&#39;t that change the way the magma moves underneath the plates? I herd from a scientific report that because of the melt the the weight of the ice no longer pushing down on crust is causing the crust to rise, so we can say that that this movement changes the magma flow direction?  If this is true isn&#39;t it safe to say that we can also blame all of this extra plate tectonic movements which are causing all of these earth quakes on climate change?
Comment 14.1	No.
Comment15	Thank You Dutch for keeping us informed.  God Bless You and Yours.  üíôüíúüíôüíúüíôüíúüíô
Comment16	I think the refuse from Kilauea will show up on Maui.
Comment17	I got a question for ya Dutch, do you see any correlation between the movement of the magnetic North Pole and EQ activity at either south pole  or north pole,, curious about that, indications are the earth is due for magnetic flip
Comment 17.1	A lot of ppl have been specualting about thhis one, you might also try Skywatch media news. Steve&#39;s a great guy and a lot of Dutch followers are over there as well. He did a video this week on just that topic.
Comment 17.2	South has not moved at all.
Comment18	Great Job Dutch
Comment19	Thanks!üå¥üê†üå∫üå¥
Comment20	El Mirage Dry Lake filled with water and did not see that it rained but close to Ridgecrest
Comment 20.1	It is 86 miles away. THAT is not close at all. I LIVE closer to Ridgecrest than that-and do NOT consider myself close at all.
