Comment13	Get your facts right, torys in last 10 years have borrowed so much already!!<br />IM VOTING LABOUR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER!!
Comment 13.1	@Dave jay<br /><br />Sorry but I&#39;m not interested in voting for a circular system whereby one party screws the economy up and then another party fixes the screw up and then the previous party comes back in and screws it all up all over again. <br /><br />That&#39;s like voting for a dog that chases its own tail. I chose a continuous stable governance over that flip flop crap any day of the week.
