Comment5	Dutchsinse wont come up on my feed. I&#39;ve tried everything. Several weeks of no notices. What&#39;s happening?
Comment6	Everyone, go to copper tropical live, everyone goes there now to chat.....
Comment7	Check NZ very busy at the moment. A magnitude 6.3 quake has struck just north of Milford Sound causing significant shaking in Queenstown and other parts of the South this evening
Comment8	Hi Dutch- You stated in this video that Yellowstone formed right under/on the North American Crayton because it‚Äôs a weak point.. with this in mind, couldn‚Äôt it also be plausible that the weak point being hit in California with thousands of earthquakes could in fact also be volcanic in nature? Isn‚Äôt it plausible that the leak could be legitimate and that a super volcano is also forming in that area, just as alleged by the whistleblower?!
Comment9	I am getting really tired of hearing that term &quot;conspiracy theorist.&quot;  People need to look up the history of that phrase and who came up with it. Its a way to shame people into following the mainstream narrative. It is simply a way to bully people into thinking like we do. (FBI came up with it when people began to question the JFK murder) Every single time it is used it literally keeps people from thinking outside of the box. You can say you dont agree, but dont shame people into staying quiet. (unless it is the msm...lol..you can shame them all you want) Think about it this way....would we have airplanes and cars if people were shamed into staying within the mainstream narrative? We wouldnt be sitting here listening to Dutch if he had not kept pushing what he believed despite the shaming he has received.
Comment10	So grateful that you care enough to do all this work to help people and give them good advice
Comment11	There is sooo much going on in this world. My heart is crying. People hurting, confused, broke, sick and the weather warfare  is deliberately depopulating the people and  stealing the land we live on. Hence, I am drawing close to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and keeping in His Word. This earthly life is ending soon. I am storing my treasure in Heaven. Love and prayers people.

Comment13	Hello from New Zealand, thank you for keeping us informed. Please keep¬†up the good work. We get lots of earthquakes here, so it&#39;s always good to be one step ahead, of possible quakes coming our way.
Comment14	Thanks Copper!!
Comment15	Thank you Copper and Dutch and family! ‚úåüò∏
Comment16	Thank You, Thank You Miss Copper, You is still da bestest, this side of any where. . . . B BIG Time Blessed, Sweet Heart. . . .
Comment17	Excellent pronunciation of Juan de Fuca , (Few-ka) we will have  to give you honorary Washington State citizenship. Keep up the great work, and pronounce it however you wish. I will still be watching.
Comment 17.1	Wait &#39;til he has to say Snoqualmie! Tehachapi gave him some issues for a bit, but he figured it out. LOL Better than Mary Greeley....I cringe while listening to her, but she tries, bless her. ‚úå‚ô•Ô∏èüò∏
Comment18	what did he mean by 187 for youtube?
Comment 18.1	It is in section 187 of CA criminal penal code for the crime of murder.  That is what the internet said it was.
Comment19	I cant be the only person who sees that DS completely blew off mentioning the 4.1 offshore Oregon 2 days ago AND the offshore 3.3. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br />Another total failure to mention the 2.93 off Petrolia, CA, (that&#39;s not even including the swarm there where some have already dropped off the map), but who&#39;s counting? I am, viewers should be. <br />Happens every time man, theres a pattern here. It begs the question of,  &quot;WHY&quot;?
Comment 19.1	@ThereIsABattleForYourSoul JesusLovsYou <br />I understand what&#39;s taking place. What I cant figure out is how/why DS &quot;fans/groupies&quot; dont pick up on this little factoid. Every single time theres significant activity off OR coast, DS is either MIA (it&#39;s a birthday, mom fell down, yadda, yadda...), or, he completely ignores it. People look to him like a &quot;weatherman&quot;, dont look for themselves, don&#39;t question HIS narrative. How he gets away with doing an &quot;update&quot; while completely ignoring pertinent info, and NO ONE calls him out is beyond me.
Comment 19.2	Chelle Shiiki I live in Oregon
Comment 19.3	Chelle Shiiki because they don‚Äôt want people wanted because they want to use their almost slaves still for their companies until it‚Äôs time or they want them all to die so that they don‚Äôt try to get saved maybe before they wake up in hell for an eternity.
Comment20	Thank you for the update, and happy birthday to the Dutchess üòä Hope you are well!
