Comment1	She would be a hero if she ran a nation wide massive campaign through all the prefectures towns and islands about why mental health care is something that you shouldn’t be ashamed of or feel bad about going. Everyone needs a little help sometimes.
Comment2	She is beautiful
Comment3	Mental health issues do not necessarily mean mental illness. I do wish i understood more of Japanese Imperial culture.  The new Empress appears to be poised to fulfill Her destinies. She has beautifully shaped eyes.
Comment4	How come we never about Japan&#39;s royal family. Its always about the dysfunctional British Royal family.
Comment5	They are a lovely couple. I know my Princess Masako will be the best royal.
Comment6	I always feel sorry for this nice woman - she got so much under pressure that she had got a depression , stopped talking and stayed behind the palaces walls for years ...<br />Her husband always has been at her side  -  and I hope she is now strong and secure enough to fulfil her role ... Good luck and strength , Your Majesty !! 🌹<br />With love from Germany !! 💟
Comment7	Who is this shallow ignorant ugly asian reporter?Looks so stupid, hahaha.
Comment8	If anything, the emperor really stood by her all these years and protected her from the pressures of the emperial household agency. She will do great and is already in her element.
Comment9	Sit around, smile to the crowd, collect your huge welfare check, everything around you bought by the hard work of your citizens... yeah, life of royalty must be hard.<br /><br />The only time royal life is bad is when the citizens wake up and realize that they are being conned.
Comment10	I feel very bad for her, she’s obviously very intelligent and has had to change her destiny to be with the man she loves. I hope she can get out of the shackles of the imperial system and regain some of her confidence!
Comment11	Women marrying into Japanese royalty do not whinge about &quot;pressures&quot;, unlike  British royalty
Comment 11.1	yes they do. Did you watch the video?
Comment12	My goodness. I had no idea the Japanese royals were quite so diminutive...Melania towers over both. Nevertheless the Emperor and Empress present themselves with great dignity and panache.
Comment13	I would love to see her make it her mission, if possible, to combat the stigma surrounding mental illness in Japan. Mental illness has such a profound impact on society and must be faced like any other illness, less it lead to tragedy.
Comment14	shame on this misogynist country for ruining such a wonderful woman!!!
Comment15	SHUT UP FEMINIST ! Your shit ideology doesn&#39;t belong in Japan, nor anywhere else
Comment 15.1	Neither does yours. 🤗✌🏾
Comment16	Ganbarimasu!
Comment17	Must be rather chilly in the studio...
Comment18	"Hi, to relax from all this pressure, I just made a musical video about Japan:<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/-GU3r6BoKLk"">https://youtu.be/-GU3r6BoKLk</a><br />..for those who love Japan and breakbeat! Thanks for the visit :)"
Comment19	Who would not get depressed if you vannot live the life you want to live. Great respect for Empress Masako. She was very happy visiting the Netherlands.
Comment20	This reporter is just plain dumb. She obviously didn’t read up. Another Trumpian
Comment21	Sorry BBC. Now I remember that a baby monkey new born in Takasakiyama Japan was named after Charlotte - the first daughter of William and Catherine - then it was  criticised by the british media such as BBC,  Telegraph and others. And the zoo apologised it but remarkable is that the british royal family announced they didn&#39;t mind the naming.
Comment22	she is pretty until now and you can see her pretty now at her princess 🥰
Comment23	The emperor loves his empress so much.
Comment 23.1	He does. It is so sweet.
Comment24	"The reporter says, &quot;Japan&quot; in neither British or American English correctly. So <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23weird"">#weird</a>"
Comment 24.1	SHE SAID IN IN AN INDIAN WAY
Comment25	このへんな顔の女誰や。<br />典型的な外国かぶれ。きも。
Comment26	The Feminism is in fact attacking women, not all women want to be in the front of the battle that’s why the muscle men’s exist is to protect her to support her while he is fighting, and this forms change much these days.<br />So it’s ok to have women in the power but is also ok to keep women protected from this ugly world. And women’s in fact knows it and use the men for it but then this feminism came saying women have the same muscle as men then OK then go there and fight agains this ugly world for your family then.<br />Guys will now be at home cooking and washing ( oh my god I really want that to happen ...... any strong butch women want to marry me ? I cook I wash I clean with pleaure )
Comment27	She is a wonderful woman and will make a incredible empress!!!
Comment28	LOL<br /><br />Life is so hard! <br />What a load of 💩
Comment29	Thank you.
Comment30	I love empress Masako, she&#39;s the epitome of beauty, elegance, and intelligence.
Comment31	It has been  extremely tough on Masako Sama , but Emperor Naruhito stood by her all this time and now she is supporting him as new Emperor <br />Just goes to shoe Love is very strong between them .
Comment32	it&#39;s like meghan markle. Masako grew up in the states, she went to public high school, became student president  and went to  Harvard after. Then, you suddenly become a wife from royal family where, you have to live like a stone age where women can not say anything, and being bullied by the royal court for having a american personality.
Comment 32.1	@Ramon Lopez Very good response Ramon. Unlike all these idiots...
Comment 32.2	"@Ana Marie Vivero Both admittedly suffering “adjustment disorder”, I mean it’s a fact.  This is the problem, people like you connate on the prestige and traditional values and I’m pretty sure Masako is probably much more successful than MM, due to her extensive Harvard education. But you can’t ignore that they are still HUMAN BEING, these two MODERN WOMEN are being thrust into a Stone Age culture, and people like you, ignore the fact that these princesses are still human and prone to mental health, issues. Something has to change, and I am glad both women are talking about it. So, if your biggest issue is that Masako and MM are incomparable... Guess what. They are still human beings and prone to the same mental issue that every living person on earth experienced."
Comment 32.3	Ramon Lopez <br />She is not like meghan at all!<br /><br />Empress Masako’s Father is a Diplomat!!!<br />He’s been Japanese Ambassador to many country.<br /><br />Please don’t compare Masako Sama to meghan!!!!! PERIOD!!!!!
Comment 32.4	@Rain Y And Meghan Markel is uneducated? She went to North Western and worked at U.S embassy at Buenos Aries and she is also U.N ambassador. I think, Princess Masako is insulted in your intuition regarding other women. Masako holds very extensive educational and work background in the states, so she definitely knows first hand,  how hard for women to be in a position of power. So going back, what you said.. I respect Masako, a lot, but your statement is literally nothing to do with the Princess but pure hatred for Meghan.
Comment 32.5	Pls don’t insult Empress Masako by comparing her with that American D-list actress. Empress Masako is Harvard and Oxford educated Japanese diplomat before marrying into the royal family. Empress Masako is also elegantly beautiful, well loved and respected by the Japanese people.
Comment33	This reporter is always famous for including lies and Bad faith. Be careful not to be fooled.
Comment 33.1	How is this biased. Lol don’t just spit criticism and back up your opinions. Mr “no name”
Comment34	BBC, CNN and NYT reports are biased.
Comment 34.1	Just a biased as Fox. Wake up
Comment35	Westerners may be indistinguishable, but I think this reporter is not Japanese.
Comment36	Why is BBC  always negative about Japanese culture . . .<br />なんでBBCは日本の文化に対していつも否定的なんだろうか。
Comment 36.1	別に全然ネガティブに感じないと思うけど。事実を伝えているだけ。最後もポジティブなコメントで終わってる。新しい、今までなかったような人がこれから輝き続ける、ていう感じのニュアンス。<br /><br /><br />It’s FACTUAL TRUTH that women in Japanese society are burdened with traditional, and often sexist expectations. As someone who was born and raised in Tokyo, I don’t see this as anything “negative” it’s just the “truth.” I’m sorry that the truth is so upsetting, maybe that’s something that can change in the coming generations.
Comment 36.2	@Krento <br />NHK which is Japanese public broadcasting station is just like BBC in a scene...
Comment 36.3	Because they hate motherhood and children. They hate tradition and culture too! Leftist mind poison
Comment 36.4	8989とろろまま <br />まあ日本人が日本文化をこれからも支持していくしかないと思います。イギリスも数ある一国に過ぎません。戦勝国というだけです。
Comment 36.5	いつもいつもいつも<br />ホントムカつく👊😠
Comment37	Во Имя БОГА, Любимого.<br />Слава БОГУ, Милостивому. БОГ один, другого<br />божества нет. БОГ сотворил Землю и Небо,<br />ОН дождем с неба растит вам пропитание.<br />БОГ всех знает, видит и слышит. Ничего<br />не происходит без ЕГО дозволения. К БОГУ<br />предстоит всем и прибытие.

Бойтесь Ада, следуйте Мне<br />Пророку, доверяйте Свету. Пророк Камил.
Comment38	She was a bright woman. She had an excellent diplomatic career ahead of her. But Naruhito fell in love with her, and she had to agree. Masako did not want to marry him. She knew her life would be ruined, serving only the people, not herself. And it is. Crippling depression, anxiety and various diseases haunted her as she served her tenure as the Crown Princess. And the unnecessary pressure by the Imperial Family to produce a male heir. I hope things will get better for her as the Empress Consort.
Comment39	Japan is full of female sexism why can’t a female take over at least England has Queen Elizabeth
Comment 39.1	Well, it is tradition. Japan and England are worlds apart. Japan has a far more rich history and a much complex culture. There have been 126 Emperors of Japan to date, starting with the legendary Emperor Jimmu in 660 BC. But believe it or not, there have been 8 female Emperors or Empresses who have ruled Japan, upon the death of their Fathers or brothers. Such as Empress Suiko, who came to the throne in the year 593. For thousands of years, there was no law stating that females cannot ascend the throne. It was only in 1889 that this law was passed, under the wish of Emperor Meiji, who commanded immense power by defeating the shoguns and daimyos- lords who had divided Japan like a cake for themselves. Since the first 20 Emperors were all, obviously, males, it became kind of unusual for a female to ascend the throne. There was no law prohibiting a female, but like the U.S, who has never had a female president, it became an archaic tradition of sorts. And later a law which still exists. The Japanese Parliament had seriously thought about changing this law, but the birth of Prince Hisahito in 2006 came as a miracle to tradition upholders in the country. And the Parliament dropped the subject of female succession.
Comment40	สุดงดงามเรียบง่าย ทรงพระเจริญ
Comment41	Since the Empress&#39;s marriage to the Emperor, he has had a tough daily life such as poor physical condition, but the smile of “Imperial Thanks” is refreshed and softened.🙌😄😌🎌👑
Comment42	she said.  Princess Masako had to give up her career, like many other Japanese women.  but Since she was married to the Emperor family, I think it is natural to resign from public work.  In addition, what she said sounds like in Japan that it is natural to stop working if married, but now there are women who continue working even after marriage and childbirth, and also quit their work on their own dicision. I think that the theory that Japanese women generally quit their work after marriage with the symbol of Princess Masako is different.  I think that it depends on each couple&#39;s thoughts, economic situation, and occupation.
Comment43	Liberal does not respect the empress&#39; commitment to dignity to her country and long tradition.  She left her personal career a long time ago and has a wonderful princess. Just appreciate history a bit.
Comment44	She looks like a gilded, caged Bird, NOT a wife and mother. How terribly sad. She looks like she wants to run away!! They should send Princess Toshi to Europe or the U.S. to college so she can have a life.
Comment 44.1	You are a liar otherwise idiot. You don&#39;t know anything.
Comment45	日本には、「皇紀」という元号があります。　今年は、皇紀２６７９年です。<br />世界で最も古いエンペラーは、日本人の誇りでもあります。<br />しかし、その中に民間人が入るという事は、想像を絶する苦難の道だと思われます。
Comment46	Masako&#39;s father is a real go-getter and she is extremely self-conscious.  Crown Prince’ｓ (now Emperor) marriage with her (a just yuppie) was, and still is a real nightmare.  She is always fussy about official duties, she pays little respect to the rituals!
Comment47	Very hard if a person cannot be herself like her mother in law.
Comment48	She has refused to marry the Prince and her father was sad to see her enter Royal family as he already knew its tuff life. They don&#39;t have freedom and in the sight of the ministry of Arby.
Comment49	She doesn&#39;t need an interpreter @bbc she finished her studies in the us and oxford. The reporter did not make a bsckgrounder first
Comment 49.1	@YK SW omg empress masako is graceful! i love her so much
Comment 49.2	Empress masako sama  speaks Russian and French too.
Comment 49.3	Oxford and Harvard
Comment50	At this age and time, there is no more need to have an emperor or queen, prince and princess. It&#39;s taxpayers&#39; money not spent properly.
Comment51	Description says she was the second woman to be empress, I&#39;m pretty sure all of the previous emperors wives were empresses, how is she second?
Comment 51.1	@Adi Abdillah I think the Imperial rules were updated or changed sometime ago to allow them to marry non-royals.
Comment 51.2	@RADO come to think about it. Did the Imperial rules allow the marriage of a royal blood to a commoner, or they are an exception?
Comment 51.3	2nd Empress who was a commoner. Not of royal blood.
Comment52	Who was in line after Naruhito if the boy was never born and the girl was not allowed to succeed.
Comment 52.1	I want to see  the daughter of Masako and new king become tbe Queen like Queen  Elizabeth. <br />They should change the Law.
Comment 52.2	Naruhito&#39;s younger brother, Prince Akishino is currently the first in line to the throne, that means, he is the Crown Prince. After Akishino comes his son, Prince Hisahito. And after him too, comes Naruhito&#39;s uncle, the very old Prince Hitachi.
Comment53	男子うめ〜
Comment54	The second woman? All previous Japanese empresses were male or transgender? If BBC makes such a stupid mistake, it is natural that all other outlets lie and make up a fake news...
Comment 54.1	@Pom Pompom Look at the description under the BBC News: It is written: &quot;Empress Masako is only the second woman to become empress of Japan, after her husband Naruhito took the Chrysanthemum Throne.&quot;
Comment 54.2	B Batjargal She said “the second commoner”.
Comment55	It is a great hope of mine; to see the Empress truly come into her own. How great would it be if they did change the law if the question was put to the Princess Aiko, would you want to be Empress Regnant?
Comment 55.1	@Oriental Motion Dance Studios It is certainly time for the shackles of WWII to be broken. Many of us were not born during that world tragedy, so why are we still holding that against non allied nations. I hope this can happen for Japan.<br /><br />Kind Regards.
Comment 55.2	@Oriental Motion Dance Studios Thank you for your comment. :)<br /><br />From what I have seen through Japanese media, I can tell the people of Japan would support an Empress Regnant. The people seem to love The Imperial Family.<br /><br />The little Prince Hisahito looks a sweet boy and the Crown Prince and Princess Akishino seem lovely. <br /><br />I just feel so sad for Empress Masako and want to see her empowered as a woman and as a human. If Aiko were to be styled Crown Princess it would also be empowering for her as well. <br /><br />Princess Aiko should be free to marry whomever, but perhaps steps taken to protect relevant aspects of the Imperial system and do away with others that seem to be complicating it&#39;s future survival. <br /><br />Kind Regards.
Comment 55.3	Many Japanese do not mind Princess Aiko being Empress Regnant. It is not about gender. However, the issue is that GHQ dismantled many of the royal families that potentially she could&#39;ve married. Other countries with King or queen do have other families they can marry. I believe that we are at the tipping point where whether we can truly be independent of US influence or not. My English isn&#39;t great so my apology in advance if I&#39;m confusing.
Comment56	Soo cute. Love Empress.
Comment57	She has been embarrassed for many years because of the failure to give a birth to a son. Japan should change the law to allow a female heir to take the Chrysanthemum Throne. Without presence of a royal concubine, it is not realistic to limit a heir of it to only a male. <br />I wont to see a future wife of the last male heir suffer from the same fate as hers.
Comment 57.1	Reigen Lucilfer The 1947 imperial household law was passed at he last session of Imperial diet. The law which defined that a male heir only can succeed the throne was passed relatively recently. The law was largely influenced by Prussian law system and assumes that there was an implicit agreement, which prioritize a paternal bloodline, in past successions. <br />The fact is that Youro-Ritsuryo, an effective law before modernization just specifies a descendant of an emperor, who was not given a family name, can succeed it. So, a female heir was not prevented from succeeding it. There were actually many empress. One empress called Jingu-Kogo was not regarded as empress now. But she was apparently gave a birth to a male heir after her husband, the previous emperor was killed hundreds of days ago. The modern Japanese history denied her enthronement. But, her boy was not able to be called one in the paternal line. So, the early Japan did not prevent a female heir from taking the throne.
Comment 57.2	it is because of stupid us always interfere with other country&#39;s law and rule. waay back then, ancient times, there were head empress. but because us girl are not allowed to succeed anymore.
Comment58	BBC the feminist Inquisition channel
Comment59	she does only thing what she wants.<br /><br />I respect his majesty. <br />but I don&#39;t like empress masako.
Comment60	She Very Brutifur Empress!
Comment61	I think your story is outdated. The pressure is on longer present since it has already been ruled out that Prince Akishino be Crown Prince. That has removed the pressure of her producing a male heir.
Comment 61.1	The pressure isn’t only about her not being able to birth a male child. It’s about feeling restricted, even imprisoned because she has had to compromise her career, her ambitions. Pressure adds up. And just because a male child was born that pressure doesn’t just “disappear.” Mental health doesn’t work like that.
Comment 61.2	Have you read the book , the prisoner of the Chrysanthemum throne? It entails her depressing life. Even though the succession crisis is over, the Imperial Family still torments her by reminding and insulting her that she wasn&#39;t able to produce a male child. But now that she is the Empress consort, things might get better for her.
Comment62	They should have concubines to have babies how it was before USA invade their country.
Comment 62.1	But if they do that a fight will break out, political power of position. That is how korea&#39;s monarchy ended as well.
Comment63	Love Japan from Brazil.
Comment 63.1	Thank you. :)
Comment 63.2	thank you
Comment64	BBC, why are you using Korean to report on Japan? And this inaccurate info on Japan.

Comment68	Meghan, Duchess of Sussex needs to learn from the Empress of Japan and grow a backbone!<br />The empress was an outsider, and even though she struggled after marrying into japan&#39;s royal family, she is now a successful ambassador for her country.
Comment 68.1	Lmfao LOL... Yeah Meghan Markle is learning from her by getting the same faith, suffering from depression.  You know Masako, is American right? She grew up in the states. She was always bullied by the courtier for showing her personality... Sounds like Meghan Markle. Lol
Comment 68.2	Audrance what are you talking about? Empress Masako suffered a nervous breakdown and had clinical depression for many years due to the presdure of royal life. She is a lively ki d and sensitive person but was out of the public eye for a long time (shortlyafter the birth of her only child) and took years to recover.  Ithas been a long process. Duchess Meghan hopefully won&#39;t suffer similarly so it is totally inappropriate, spiteful and ignorant to talk of  having a backbone to get through mental illness.
Comment69	so only commoners are women? What is this summary of the video, BBC News?
Comment70	Masako didn&#39;t want to marry Naruhito. It&#39;s him who went after her. She tried to escape but couldn&#39;t. Masako was a very intelligent and independent woman, with successful school, diploma and career. She wasn&#39;t made to become empress. She had a nervous breakdown a few years ago.
Comment71	Only men can inherit the Japanese throne.. Japanese are truly the smartest species!
Comment72	What&#39;s there to handle, when the&#39;re servants everywhere. What the job, have babies and smile.
Comment 72.1	@dothedeed  Naruhito won&#39;t do that. When he asked asked Masako&#39;s hand in marriage, he said &quot; I will protect you with my life&quot;. Hell, he nearly renounced his claim to the throne for her. He stood by her when she went through crippling depression when the rest of the family tormented her for not having a male child.
Comment 72.2	This is the false impression that the modern public has about monarchies. They have to do public duties. This woman has undergone depression, anxiety due to that. She has to face sorrow each day by visiting disaster struck places in the world each day. It is not a choice, it is a duty. You won&#39;t be able to take her job for an hour, even with 50 servants. Fool. You don&#39;t live in a monarchy, so you don&#39;t know anything. I am a half royal of a defunct royal family. I know how it is. We lost our royal status decades ago, although we still have an ancestral bungalow and a fort in our hands.
Comment 72.3	But that&#39;s the problem - she couldn&#39;t get pregnant. And Japanese culture puts a lot of shame on people and pressure people to commit suicide. After all if she killed herself her husband could re-marry and then maybe have a son with a new wife.
Comment73	Mental illness can affect anyone. I am glad her husband stood by her.
Comment 73.1	Porphyria among royalty. Porphyria get misdiagnosed for &quot;mental&quot; illness. Assuming certain things I Tzar Theodore IV of Russia and Bellorussia and Ukraine ECT.
Comment 73.2	Harry and Meghan whining about how hard their life is so fickle and fake they don&#39;t know real pain, Empress Masako is true Victim. Her husband made a statement they didn&#39;t create a circus around her and demand public sympathy, she genuinely had a problem and retreated from public life to deal with her issues. Japan people might not have understood what was wrong but they accepted it. The more you complain the more you lose sympathy.
Comment 73.3	emperor naruhito is a gentleman and empress masako is a beautiful lady! tenno heika banzai!

Comment77	&quot;I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned. and thine hair is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare.  Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine.  Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.  I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers&#39; skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.  I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.  And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.  Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.  And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God.  But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.  And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.  Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them, And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.  My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord.  Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured.  Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter, That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?  And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.  And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord God;) That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.  Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.&quot; <br /><br /><br /><br />- Ezekiel 16:7-25

Comment82	I’m extremely proud of having her as our Empress. She is intelligent, kind, motherly, and impeccable in my eyes despite her struggles. She will make it fine.
Comment 82.1	@Keizel Harf There was an article regarding Empress Masako years before she became an empress. It said that Empress Masako became depressed was because of the strict Imperial Household rules and how repressed she was. Prior to her marriage (or was it after her marriage), she said she would not change and become the bridge between the people and the Imperial Family. She was very vibrant back then but the Imperial household repressed her so much. She was outspoken, free and filled with vigor but she gave it all up and there was no turning back. I remember how she was called the broken butterfly.
Comment 82.2	@Krento i&#39;m sorry but i don&#39;t understand. What correlation between my replies with feminism? And i&#39;m not western actually, but Asian, Southeast Asian for more specific.
Comment 82.3	@Keizel Harf How else would the Imperial lineage continue? She had a job and she did it, and she should be applauded for it. Stop bringing your feminist (western) views into the Japanese Imperial family
Comment 82.4	Keizel Harf Well empress masako was a career woman type of people, who grew up in many countries, graduated from Harvard University, and worked for Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However because she got married to the emperor (now), and entered into the imperial family, whatever she does is under control and restricted by the imperial family. Due to those pressures, she was stressed and suffered from mental health problems. I believe having a son would have been one of those pressures, although it’s not “forced” but I think she was forced mentally. I think she’s ok now.
Comment 82.5	@Keizel Harf After you gave biased and rude questions to Japanese people ? Masako Sama started another new life as Empress with her strong determination to move forward. So, you&#39;ll be &#39;nice&#39; about her, yeah ?
Comment83	BBC, You never celebrate anything about Japan.
Comment 83.1	@Ahmed Saeed BBC always ignore the  journey of a thousand miles, just stick to little tiny report.
Comment 83.2	White supremacy attitude. No need to be surprised about it. Britishers are usually number one when it comes to racism
Comment 83.3	BBC&#39;s insolence toward Japanese culture sometimes may be derived from envy. I noticed it when once I saw BBC reported japanese Shinkansen(bullet train) and MAGLEV. The new emperor and empress both have experience of studying at Oxford but BBC wants to disregard it.
Comment 83.4	So ture. I don&#39;t know why BBC is always negative about Japanese culture . . .
Comment 83.5	This reporter always mixes lies
Comment84	Who gives ananal fuck about a demon ?
Comment85	THERES ALSO ANOTHER HUUUGE DISTINCTION BETWEEN JAPAN N UK ISLANDS <br />THE SIZE OF THW DECK
Comment86	IN BETWEEN THE ISLANDS OF JAPAN AND BRITIAN IS THE GREAT VAST OF THE LANDS IN THE DISTANCE <br />IF ANY  SIMILARITIES OR DISTINCTIONS LIES IN THE DISTANCE ,HAS FORMED IN THE DISTANCE
Comment87	I think they should change their succession laws. They should let women be part of it, and also let women who marry retain their place in the royal family
Comment 87.1	rufioh traditions are very important to Japan it’s not something you just change
Comment88	It&#39;s easy to get sons... use sperm tube with a y chromosome then BAM!! a baby boy is born.<br /><br /><br /> <br /><br />;p
Comment 88.1	And bam that baby boy might be gay
Comment 88.2	you&#39;re welcome
Comment89	Such a beautiful couple. I wish them all them all the best!! They both have very difficult roles to play. But to do it with such grace... lovely!

Comment96	DOES SHE USE A TOILET ❓😇😇
Comment 96.1	Askeing stupid questions
Comment 96.2	Bo she shits on the floor stupid!
Comment97	They should change the law. Women used to be able to rule just like men. I think they should also allow the women in the family who marry commoners to be able to keep their royal title. I do believe if changes aren’t done the family will find themselves extinct soon.
Comment 97.1	Keep your agenda out of Japan it is not needed not every one welcomes these agendas one day the true reason for theses agendas will come to light
Comment 97.2	Keep your feminist agenda out of Japan.
Comment 97.3	Empresses only took the throne when no male heirs were ready at the time, when there is one, they ALL returned the throne to a male from the male bloodline.
Comment 97.4	They don&#39;t need to change it now.
Comment98	Monarchies are another form of big government. Monarchies are garbage
Comment 98.1	None of your business, foreigner
Comment99	This family was directly responsible for the atrocities committed by the imperial forces in the Second Sino-Japanese War and in World War II, why are the BBC giving them plublicity? They never even apologised for the rape of Nanking?
Comment100	Who will be the next 🤔
Comment 100.1	his younger brother, akishino then his nephew, hisahito.
Comment101	Japan should allow the daughters of the emperor to become empress like in England.
Comment 101.1	Sajal Jain it’s a different culture in Japan the emperor is needed for stability
Comment 101.2	@Joshua Swallow yes japan should do the sams
Comment 101.3	@Sajal Jain that&#39;s the UK not Japan
Comment 101.4	"@Joshua Swallow <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_Crown_Act_2013"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_Crown_Act_2013</a>"
Comment 101.5	Sajal Jain interesting if true
Comment102	Oh boohoo, there’s more important things than careers you idiots. If she’s not up for it, it was her decision to accept it or not.
Comment103	If only👩🏽Asian women in America🇺🇸carried themselves with such elegance🎖️.
Comment 103.1	they already do....
Comment104	Talk about complicated thing. Hail teenage life!!
Comment105	I heard she gives a wicked hot handie.
Comment106	Congratulation for naruhito
Comment107	Jap”ah”n
Comment108	the female anchor is terribly horrible
Comment109	My Japanese mother in the past talked about most people in Japan felt sorry for Masako for the longest time. &quot;She is our Princess Diana. A strong woman who was connected to the people and wanted to do great things in her own right...but the royal family decided to mentally beat her to submission.&quot;
Comment 109.1	@Cam C Don&#39;t be a moron... talk to me once, you read the article.
Comment 109.2	@Ramon Lopez &quot;Comparing her to a typical gang banger American black girl&quot; <br /><br />uhh...? lol
Comment 109.3	@ミゲルルイス Great! Shows the capacity of your knowledge.
Comment 109.4	@Ramon Lopez i wrote you are a real idiot and it is. Putamadre.
Comment110	Only men can inherit the throne the left seem ok with that as its just Japanese but if that was a white country there would be massive out cry
Comment 110.1	I think Japan should allow it just for the daughter of Naruhito and Masako, who is a very smart girl who has the level to enter Todai University, while the boy who is supposed to become emperor is stupid and has a bad temper.
Comment 110.2	@Karen Byrd That will change very quickly once Japan extracts itself from the Paris Accords which are straining its economy. Then the Japanese will start to get married and have babies again. All carefully arranged as everything is in Japan.
Comment 110.3	We all seen what the Japanese think about this PC crap when our western idiots started banging on about appropriating their culture. They started to advertise selling cultures, great people
Comment 110.4	@Tejas Mohite The Japanese are dying out ethnically speaking. Extremely low birthrates. Some predict that there won&#39;t be any Japanese in a hundred years.
Comment 110.5	There have only been 6(or 7 if you count Matilda) regal Queens of England wrt the monarchy since William the Conqueror because of male only gender rules of primogeniture. Those rules have been changed so there may be more female queens in the future but not for a long time. It depends upon whether Prince George, who is 6 years old, has a first born girl.
Comment111	No poor  harry and markel the scrubber today BBC .. how strange..
Comment112	Life can be so hard for Royals...
Comment 112.1	They suffer so
Comment 112.2	AWResistance , exactly
Comment 112.3	@Soham Sharma Indeed. Monarchy is an ancient and natural human inclination, for the very reason that it starts with a family. That family is elevated by the people. In return we have requirements for what we expect. <br />Republic is a system that is young and currently failing. Inevitably the two party system of democracies will lead to a sheepish disillusioned populace.
Comment 112.4	@damein noble I agree with you. The modern public, especially ignorant Americans have made every other form of government obsolete other than a corrupted presidential republic. Fools.
Comment 112.5	Spoken like someone who has no idea what life is like for a family who&#39;s main role is to have a care for the entire nations affairs of state, ceremonial as well as diplomatic and affairs of state. Sure they could give it all up. But I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re not Japanese either. Those of us that have a constitutional monarchy as its preferred system will agree, we expect a lot from our royals. And then we put them in a gilded cage. Duty first, self second.
Comment113	Well, this was a useless 2-minutes I’ve spent...
Comment114	I bet the BBC feels the same pressures having had so many scandals!
Comment 114.1	@Joshua Swallow Goodness Gracious life is bad on JSA
Comment 114.2	Do you have nothing better to do but obsess over bbc and a pedophile
Comment115	"Suddenly it’s become fashionable for Royals to tell us how hard their lives are?  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23poorlittlerichgirl"">#poorlittlerichgirl</a>"
Comment116	<b>Nani</b> ?
Comment117	Can someone please say what and how much the poor taxpayers are taking from the monarchies, than the monarchies are taking from the poor honest (working class) taxpayers??????????????
Comment 117.1	People should stop glorifying greasy elected politicians they cost more than monarchies and of course stealing from the treasury is the main occupation of every president
Comment 117.2	Brainstorming Plus What about the cost of a presidential family in a republic? How much does it cost to maintain the presidential Palace, presidential retreat, motorcade, travels, state dinners, etc. They are heads of State, one elected the other unelected and hereditary. Monarchies usually have reports on the money they spend, for example the UK royal family publishes a report each year. The majority of the citizens are content in having a constitutional Monarchy, it works great with a parliamentary system, and it gives prestige to the State, more than an old politician who cares only for his power and career.
Comment118	strange country where one man lives in a palace and another in a pod.
Comment119	Any One Who Loves Me?  Like here
Comment120	They should have deposed the emperor after WW2.
Comment 120.1	@Huikwan Cheung Nah I&#39;m fine. I want to depose my own monarch so don&#39;t take it the wrong way.
Comment 120.2	Piss off, you western garbage
Comment 120.3	It is easier to deal with one guy then lots of smaller entrenched factions.
Comment 120.4	@okdoky The germans saw The Fuhrer as a god like figure. I doubt the americans would of kept them in charge.
Comment 120.5	they did not dispose the emperor as it could cause harm to the society back then as the Japan people saw the emperor as a godlike figure.
Comment121	&quot;naruto&quot;
Comment 121.1	Humorous idiot.
Comment 121.2	Naruhito
Comment122	She’s so cool!
Comment123	Banzai! Appare!
Comment124	She got killed and replaced with a clone.
Comment125	This is 1st time seeing japanese king. That nose very familiar
Comment 125.1	Emperor, not King
Comment 125.2	@JASON&#39;S WORLD nope, very familiar one. The nose of many kings around the world
Comment 125.3	Jackie Chan?
Comment126	I agree, I don’t think I could attend endless lunches, opening shops and travelling all over the world in luxury like our royal family in Britain do, and reading prepared speeches and sitting on thrones! It’s enough to wear out anyone. And all that money! No mortgages, staff to wait on you hand foot and finger, and even put toothpaste on your toothbrush! It’s no small wonder they all have worries to keep them up at night.
Comment 126.1	@Annyai Presoski Not simply propaganda. Royalty is part of the Tourism charm.👌 It is an unconscious psyche that people buy to believe, thus the influence/soft power of the U.K head of state on the World stage. I do work on PR/Branding before,  Image is a must for those people who work on the bigger stage. And the Foreign office were using them as a platform, so were not only talking about the monetary equivalent here.👌The Gov&#39;t. were refusing to open the can of worms regarding the tourism myth bcoz other subject will be dug out. Like tax heaven and foreign aids funding issue. Surely, you do have the Idea how money flows around the hands of the so called Politician, right?
Comment 126.2	@Annyai Presoski<br />No worries. 😁👍
Comment 126.3	George 89 Sorry George.....I’m getting old....!!
Comment 126.4	@Annyai Presoski<br />Read my comment again. I&#39;m agreeing with you.
Comment 126.5	George 89. Actually, having worked in treasury for 42 years, I know exactly what the figures are. The bit about them bringing in more than they are paid is government propaganda for people to ‘pull out of their arses’ as you suggest. Happy pulling.
