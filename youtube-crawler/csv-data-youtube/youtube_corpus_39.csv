Comment6	Having a Russian asset as your Prime Minister trying to play around with this deal or no deal Brexit situation, you guys are never going to get anything done over there. Hang the PM and find yourself someone actually reliable, somebody who doesn’t wanna be like Donald Trump and go down on Vladimir Putin. We already have one treasonous piece of shit on the world stage, why are you trying to compete with us?
Comment7	Am I the only millennial with my judgement unclouded by the lies of socialism?
Comment8	It does not matter which party you support if you are a true leaver in every sence of the word then the only way we can leave is to vote BREXIT party to get it done. When its done THEN we will deal with the EU.
