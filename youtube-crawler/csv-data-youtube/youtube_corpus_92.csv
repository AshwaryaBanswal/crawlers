Comment1	Praying for you Dutch
Comment2	Thank you Dutch ‚ù§<br />Our Father is the MOST SUPER...NATURAL.
Comment3	Wait so what were those beams?
Comment4	SO-FIRES SPONTANEOUS DURING EARTH MOVEMENT?  BELIEVE IT. SEE BELOW.  BIG CRACKS EXPOSING SULFIDES TO AIR BURNING FORESTS?  YOU&#39;RE LOOKING AT IT.
Comment5	WHEN SULFIDE DEPOSITS ARE EXPOSED TO AIR BY EARTH MOVEMENT, THEY OXIDIZE SO FURIOUSLY THEY START FIRES-SEEN IT HAPPEN RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME WHILE PROSPECTING. WE WERE JUST DIGGING WITH PICKS AND SHOVELS...
Comment6	Nope. That is just condensation due to rise of humid winds trying to go over the mountain. As you saw from the Oregon smoking, it is supposed to look like at during an eruption. I don&#39;t know about the radar though.
Comment7	HEY DUTCH, CHINA HAS BUILT OVER 800 TUNNEL BORING MACHINES, RAND CORP. PATENTED THEM IN THE &#39;50&#39;S, WHO KNOWS HOW MANY ALL THE GOV&#39;S HAVE?  LINES LIKE THAT GET ME THINKING THE DEEP-EARTH TUNNEL SYSTEMS ARE FRACTURING BETWEEN POINTS WHERE THERE ARE SURFACE ENTRANCES.  THE NEWER ONES ARE VACUUM-SEALED ALL AIR EVACUATED TO ALLOW FRICTION-FREE TRAVEL ON THEIR MONORAIL MAG-LEV TRAINS THAT CAN HIT MACH 1.5, ACCORDING TO MANY I HAVE STUDIED.
Comment8	Your seismic knowledge is profound sir, however your grasp of weather phenomenon is lacking.  What you ascribe to &quot;steam&quot; escaping from the ground is in fact just water vapor hitting elevation, and pushing up into the atmosphere and condensing.  It is completely normal.  Ask the people that live in the desert regions like Phoenix Arizona.  Stick to what you know brother, we get enough BS from the regular agencies.
Comment9	‚ù§Ô∏èLove when you make these type of videos, and explain the off shore VOLCANOES üåã.
Comment10	Hope you took snapshots!  Send to Mike Morales!
Comment11	I didn‚Äôt see this till today 7/26 and I‚Äôm near Valencia Ca. and it was totally uncharacteristically humid today.
Comment12	One more thing when you ate driving on the 10 from Orange County towards Palm Springs where all the wind mills are right before that is the off ramp for Twenty nine palms and right before that in the north side of the freeway traveling east there is a place in the rocks you can see the crack that is part of the SanAndreas fault you can actually see it. Side note my brother was on one of the crews that built those wind mills.
Comment13	When I was young my parents and a bunch of relatives had cabins out in Twenty Nine Palms there is a lake way out there off Amboy Road also an abandon silver mine. We used to go out there all the time About 40 years ago. I think they thought someday it would get populated. It never did Anyway, we would go scouting around with my older brother there are pumas rocks all over. Small ones but they are there. There is a Marine Base out there also. There is also a lot of red rocks with gray in the center. They are very smooth. When I say a lot I mean it looks like you are on another planet.
Comment14	Vegas. The area is connected to the base just north of vegs.
Comment15	The government has a base under Las vegas.
Comment16	Yay! Someone noticed this weird phenomenon!! Thank you Dutch! You go beyond your call!
Comment17	The truth &amp; gravity of the situation scares me, of course!! I live directly due East of the China Lake region&gt; Across the Sierra into CA!!! If this big Mtns. Weren‚Äôt there...it wouldn‚Äôt be but a few hours drive! Anyway, of course it scares me &amp; I can‚Äôt leave. My kids &amp; Grandkids are here. But I have to say, when YOU GET FREAKED IN A LIVE STREAM &amp; Shut it down...okay now I‚Äôm really freaked! WTF is going on!!!
Comment18	So proud of you,  Dutchsince!
Comment19	Yeah of course the steams being forced up and out because the ground is sinking that gulf of California thing is moving North West. Crazy times ahead of us
Comment20	Love your sound effects!
