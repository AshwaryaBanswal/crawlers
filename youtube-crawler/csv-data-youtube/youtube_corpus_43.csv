Comment4	Dismantle BBC Jews.
Comment5	Why do remainers want to give up the UK&#39;s wealth, and share it with a lot of debt ridden broken countries!!
Comment6	I dunno why I bother but here we go, once upon a time<br />Uk:we&#39;re leaving<br />Eu:wait, you&#39;re serious? Why? This is the only way we can be powerful enough to face powers like China and the US. Thats a huge blow to Europe as a whole, we&#39;re gonna have a difficult year maybe never recover completely, you&#39;d be betraying Ireland to which you have, huh, let&#39;s say, historical amends to take care of, but mostly you&#39;d be committing suicide while also having to deal with us anyway but, you know, pissed off and ready to pillage. <br />Uk:nevertheless<br />Uk opposition:well that&#39;s 4years and 3 prime ministers of realization that we&#39;d be committing suicide, but I&#39;ll be damned if I have to tell people that not only are we going back, we&#39;d get a worse deal than we had before. People would flip at just the notion of losing the pound.<br />Eu:I mean, extensions are fine for me, the uk degrades slowly but we&#39;re getting fantastic deals out of it, man, can you believe Boris just gave us 7billion?just gave us, like that! Amazing! Maybe it&#39;s not so bad, the uk was already a stick in the mud when turkey and Tunisia wanted to join and that came to bite us as a lost opportunity.<br />Thus the saga continues
Comment7	More delays means more time for EU companies to move operations out of the UK then.<br />The longer the UK delays, the less likely they are to get any kind of deal.
Comment8	EXECUTE THESE TRAITORS!!!
Comment9	Get out you stinkers... you can send an e-mail with your requirements afterward, from the outside... Shoo... get on with it...
Comment10	Boris is a Bluffer !
Comment11	So come on little england you said it.... ya leaving if not there will be riots...😅🤣😂😄🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺♥️🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺
Comment12	How many of the public actually know WTF is in this deal and how its going to affect their lives ? and why has no politician has told the public about the EU in 2021 set to UNIFY the price of energy + massive energy bills for the UK and its also not discussed on any news channels or political talk shows  ,still its just over a year to go to find out then they will slide it in !
Comment13	The word extension = the length of the politicians noses its called the Pinocchio effect every time a politician opens his /her mouth their noses grow longer and there are a lot of long noses in Parliament !
Comment14	Only way to leave the corrupt EU is no deal the remoaners will just block every deal presented because they’re traitors and don’t want to leave.
Comment15	We are very stupid which Tusk prove beyond all doubt by saying he fears their might be a delay after he granted an extension ? Farage must now take his chance and show the country these MP&#39;s and leaders must be replaced for the country to move forward
Comment16	Halloween special
Comment17	39 billion robbed?
Comment18	Get ready for bozo deal <br />31 of October<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />3059
Comment19	Why not just extend indefinitely and the UK leaves whenever they want to? Just like any other member state of the EU? :-D
Comment20	私は日本人だけどアメリカよりも中国とイギリスのほうが好きだよ。<br />First of all, I&#39;m Japanese but I like China and the United Kingdom more than the United States.<br />China now has a friendly relationship with Japan.China is very friendly to Japan.<br />So I am worried about the UK.<br />GDP No.3 Japan has TPP.<br />GDP No2China has one road.<br />GDP No4Germany has an EU.<br />But GDPNo5 UK has nothing.<br />これが現実だよ。イギリスはもっと現実を見たほうが良い。This is reality. Britain should see more reality.<br />It doesn&#39;t mean anything because there is no reason for military action between the powers.<br />Just the righteous example of Japanese emperor Majesty Although Britain has sent Prince Charles, I think the UK attaches great importance to the relationship with Japan.<br />さあ、どうするの？イギリスは。<br />これでもしスコットランドが独立、北アイルランドが独立となったら。<br />国力はほぼ無くなる。<br />What about Britain?<br />If Scotland is independent and Northern Ireland is independent.The UK ends up with a big drop in power.さようなら。ということになってしまう。
