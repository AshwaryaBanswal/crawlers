Comment1	"My dear beloved in Christ,<br /><br />Greetings of peace and happiness to you,My name is Mrs. Janet Campbell, I am terminally ill and have decided to donate my inheritance from my husband to you the sum of $4,850,000,00 with No doubt, you may wonder how I got to know you and your information, and what informed my decision to Will my fortune to you, Dear, you have no cause to worry about these questions, I mean no harm.Regarding how I got your personal details, it is through the the help of the nurse assigned to attend to me in my private ward in this hospital, because I cannot surf on my own due to partial stroke, it is the nurse who surfs for me under my direction because I feel to donate my fortune to an individual and your profile was chosen.<br /><br />I am 58 years old woman with no child and have been diagnosed of acute cancer for about 3 years now, shortly after the death of my husband here , which made me hypertensive and resulted in stroke. In my present condition, life is without meaning to me and hope has since eluded me, each day I give my entire existence a thought, I feel over powered by gloom and despair, also saw nothing but death lurking around, All these are my reasons for deciding on using anything in my name for charity in which co-incidentally you have been favored as the beneficiary.I must tell you that I was truly touched by my inner mind to take this decision action, and I will advice you don‚Äôt see your windfall as avenue for pleasure spree but should see it as an opportunity to build and grow your personal finances to an enviable level and help others, for both your benefit and the benefit of others, always put me in your prayers and ask God to forgive my sins and trespasses. I shall be undergoing major operations in less than two weeks from now and have willed my inheritance funds to you and to help the less-privileged around you.<br /><br />If you are sure that you will use the donated fund as I have advised here, get back to me for more details.Thanks and regards<br />Mrs. Janet Campbell <br />e-Mail: janetcampbell58@<a href=""http://email.com/"">email.com</a>"

Comment69	"Bible Language ‚Äì Volume 44<br /><br />Sea Level Engineering<br /><br />Beloved in Christ Jesus Daniel the prophet who was captured by the Babylonians said that in the last days of this world scientists and geologists will be unable to predict the changes and destructions in the sky and the earth and will tear their clothes and run helter &amp; skelter. Whatever they predict will be incorrect and the end will be desolation and destruction. In today‚Äôs world scientists, geologist &amp; astrologers were earlier claiming that the end of the world would require millions of years however, now they also claim that it may be in a few centuries so they advised that mankind should move to another earth like planet. Now they claim that the climate has changed, deforestation has been done to create bigger and new cities, ozone layer has been breached, the industrial waste and plastic generated by man, pollution caused by vehicles, fresh water and sea water have contaminated which has given rise to Global warming. They also claim that due to this the icy poles of the earth are fast melting and the sea level has risen alarmingly which may submerge many island and cities very soon. <br /><br />The reasons given by the scientist for global warming are untrue. When I was young I was taught by my teacher Ms.Teresa that the pollution caused by vehicles, industries or fire would rise up and the pollutants in the air would be brought down to the earth by rains and would turn to dust giving rise to fresh air once again. The scientist, engineers and others who in the process of covering their mistakes are prophesying a false news. If we drop a square feet sized stone into the sea it would displace approximately five litres of water however, the engineers, scientists and geologists have created mighty bridges, tunnels, canals, harbours, artificial islands, tourism places by dumping million &amp; billion tonnes of steel, concrete, stones into the depths of the ocean and have made the sea level rise drastically. Millions of vessels like cruise ship, warship, cargo, submarines, coast guards, fishing vessels etc also add to the rise in sea level. There is no information or discussion about these factors which affect the sea level from any <a href=""http://source.by/"">source.By</a> hiding these facts and showcasing other facts these people are hindering the real growth of mankind by preventing God‚Äôs plan of progress of mankind which is against the will of God. <br />God said to adam and eve to go forth and multiply and live harmoniously in the world. God bestowed his wisdom upon Man to create and invent things to help him in his day to day living and was pleased with it. But God hated the sins of mankind like idol worship, rituals, superstitious beliefs. The inventions of mankind have been through the intervention of the holy spirit and these are to not to save the earth from any destruction or to protect nature but to empower mankind to fight and stand against thepowers of evil or aliens rising from the sky in order to protect mankind. Man created nuclear weapons however, is living under the fear of the same worried about the nuclear war. However, nuclear products were created by the will of God as the right usage of these can be used to bring together asteroids and meteors which are circling the solar system and create another planet or even another solar system which can be habitable for mankind. These weapons can also be used to grow the size of the earth or use them to either shrink or increase the water bodies in a similar way. Space capsules can be invented which can be powered by nuclear power which can travel to Mars and return in a few days or even create a habitable space there. These are possible only by the mercy of God the Father and His Son our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus said what is impossible for Man is possible for God. But this earth and its nature are not permanent for mankind and many prophets had predicted the destruction of earth in two thousand years. However, many religious fanatics, followers of casteism and geniuses of this world insulted them and killed very many of them. Christian missionaries and evangelists who preached about the destruction, judgement day and repentance said that Christ Himself will come to rescue you from this world and take you to a new place to give to an eternal life. Such preachers were hunted down and their blood was smeared over their countries and cities and monuments were built in their remembrance. <br />Despite their wrong doings now the same people are only highlighting the fires of the Amazon forest, the melting of snow in the Artic and Antarctica, Tsunamis, hurricanes with brute force, solar flares and increasing levels of the sea the leaders along with their bunch of scientists and advisors are lamenting on stages set over high mountains.<br />Beloved there is no feeling of security among men as even children are brutally killed. Christian Missionaries who are preaching peace, harmony, repentance and forgiveness in places filled with casteism, religious disharmony and racial abuses are being killed and the people of those places are themselves becoming witnesses to their own self destruction as the fury of nature has widely opened its mouth to devour them. Beginning from the blood of Abel son of Adam which was spilt on the earth till the blood of the innocents spilt in the churches of Sri Lanka have now risen to worsen  the anger of God. In the days of the coming of Christ all towns and hills will be levelled and destroyed as Christ said to Christians that when these destructions and natural calamities will happen you should raise your chest, lift your head, jump with joy and live cheerfully as there are many rooms in my Father‚Äôs house and I am going there to prepare a place for you and will come back to take you there. Therefore do not be afraid of these destructions and calamities but be awake and pray and wait for my coming because like the way how the world was destroyed during the times of Lot &amp; Noah this world will be destroyed. Amen."

Comment106	"Amy Knorr is the registered direct bloodline descendant of Marilyn Monroe.<br /><br />Amy Knorr is the real Farrah and the real Madonna. Madonna feigned fat Farrah as if thin. The Farrah-Madonna is the v.2 of Amy Knorr&#39;s current lifetime appearance, including the changes through the year 2000 but remaining blonde. Version 2 was set to marry Julian Casablancas, Soulmate.<br /><br />Polita Barnes, the bloodline descendant of Catherine Howard, aka Peggy Marks, is literally &quot;working&quot; the entire Glendale, CA Police Department, on behalf of the highest tier of the Russian underworld patterned behind the Norwegian underworld.<br /><br />When the underworld bumped out the real thing of Amy Knorr via sabotage, a cheap imitation was offered. Julian Casablancas did not &quot;get it&quot; because he is an underworld operative and the other underworld operatives are assigned not to tell Julian Casablancas any information. Meanwhile, the public knows...<br /><br />Six signs that your sexual feigning service is feigning your Soulmate, perceived and pertained to the feigning service itself:<br /><br />1. Foul odor<br /><br />2. Failing health, skin.<br /><br />3. Genital disorders including STD&#39;s.<br /><br />4. Smoke or other signs or visions of punishable sin.<br /><br />5. Bodily deformation caused by pertaining to a conflicting pattern as if the sacred twin pattern of your one and only Soulmate.<br /><br />6. Alcoholism.<br /><br />Polita Barnes enforced unhealthy, poor sexual feigning services amongst operatives in the underworld.<br /><br />Amy Knorr&#39;s v.2 appearance worked out as if the final appearance prior to disability,¬† caused Soulmate mode in the sexual feigning services of cousin Jen McCarthy Mons with Julian Casablancas.<br /><br />Juliet Joslin, Jen McCarthy Mons and Polita Barnes worked together for the sexual feigning service saboteur plot against the remaining saboteurs, to effect &quot;total destruction&quot;.<br /><br />Polita Barnes also feigns v.2 of Amy Knorr&#39;s projected appearance.<br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/UrZRpXoKoFQ"">https://youtu.be/UrZRpXoKoFQ</a><br /><br />The saboteurs in general feigned the Soulmate Union Sexual relationship between Amy Knorr and Julian Casablancas with its ideas, as if the sacred ideas were the parlour tricks of a circle of sexual feigning services, orgie style rather than one on one.<br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/mQ_k_VG6Syc"">https://youtu.be/mQ_k_VG6Syc</a><br /><br />Julian Casablancas learned to perceive Amy Knorr in v.2 mature at the perception change feigned by Juliet Joslin, Jen McCarthy Mons and Polita Barnes.<br /><br />Because the other saboteurs, Lisa Bullock, Gwen Stefani, Rose McGowan,¬† are assigned to &quot;change things up&quot; based on the real thing of Amy Knorr as is, ideas are lost, and Julian Casablancas cannot perceive how to retrieve anything. Julian Casablancas cannot perceive himself.<br /><br />Julian Casablancas perceived that he &quot;lost touch&quot; with Amy Knorr during sexual feigning services but it was a &quot;mute point&quot; because he is still able to sexually feign.<br /><br />The &quot;demolition trio&quot; is necessary in order for Julian Casablancas to sexually feign."

Learn about what life is all about, why God created the world, what our destiny is instead of floating in the world as if U don&#39;t mean anything to God...did you know the Holy Bible is the only book in World history that prophises future events with pin point accuracy thereby proving the God of the Holy Bible exists outside the constraints of space and time..
Comment 113.2	@eric t Shut up, don&#39;t ever talked about fairness or justice. You don&#39;t know anything about it. <br />What is justice? do you wish every japanese people to die? is that what you want so you could be satisfied? is that what you called justice? &quot;something that make YOU satisfied&quot;?<br /><br />Go to hell with your childish thinking! I studied law at university, and i hate people who speak bullshit and called it justice.
Comment 113.3	So why i shut up when we are living in a world where i can say some thing fair for those killed. U don&#39;t like then write some thing else nobody going to stop u. My grandpa died n i am going to write until there is justice for him. So how??

Comment 129.2	Plus we technically started both world wars
Comment 129.3	Well that&#39;s definitely not it, I don&#39;t see things quite this bad in Europe and I think we did kinda worse
Comment130	Japan must repent for the sins of their ancestors from ww2.
Comment 130.1	@gigi paris you are the troll , you are downplaying the war crimes committed by the west and Japan. People like you don&#39;t deserve freedom as you side with the most butcherous regimes in history. Koreans never invaded a country like the west and Japan. This is why the western governments are impaling their own citizens with high debt and high taxes.
Comment 130.2	@mike You deny and downplay all the inconvenient evil acts that Korean did. What a disgusting hypocrite. No wonder Korean are being mocked by China and NKorea. Mind your incompetent government and NKorean warmongers. Stupid troll
Comment 130.3	@gigi paris  the war between North and South Korea was started by the west after they separated from North Korea. They say the North Koreans dug a hole into Seoul, but its actually the other way around. The west has been known to lie, cheat, and steal all throughout history to gain an advantage. That&#39;s why the citizens of the west don&#39;t even trust their politicians and will continue to get taxed for no reason. That situation in Vietnam was fabricated by the west too when in fact more Vietnamese were murdered by western forces than any other country.
Comment 130.4	@Lala Fontaine You can say whatever you want but nature will end up wiping Japan and its people off this planet because of their evil energy. You are a very sick person, and bordering psychopathy.
Comment 130.5	@mike You need to get proper education. What about China and NKorea who invaded and killed millions of innocent civilians in SKorea? You cowards have no guts to fuss about what they did. <br />and Korean should apologize for your war crimes in WW2 and Vietnam war. Read about Lai dai Han.

Comment 131.2	AnimeLoverForever Victoria , I hope karma does not pass by those who kill animals and destroy nature specially this cruel way
Comment 131.3	Rose Madeleine, I just saw on news that Japan is starting a large-scale whaling project and  I thought that some terrible trouble will happen to this country and this happened...

Comment148	"The words of God already prophesied many thousand years ago what will come upon everyone in the end of time...The Lord Jesus sent me in this last day¬† to witness to all of you that you must repent before the Lord God destroy sinners on earth for disobeying the Law of Moses. The Law of Moses is an instruction of life that commands on how everyone must live on earth without tragedies and death. He commanded all of us to love one another without selfish motives and to plant food so that there will be lots of natural food on earth.¬† You built religions that teach you to reject the Law of Moses. You stop working as farmers and went to work for food manufacturers for quick money. Going back and forth to work builds up pollution on earth, the cause of storms and earthquakes to come and increased of global warming temperature. <br /><br />Jeremiah 25<br />You shall not be unpunished, for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, says the Lord of hosts. Therefore prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: ‚ÄòThe Lord will roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation; He will roar mightily against His fold. He will give a shout, as those who tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise will come to the ends of the earth‚ÄîFor the Lord has a controversy with the nations;¬† He will plead His case with all flesh. He will give those who are wicked to the sword,‚Äô says the Lord.‚Äù Thus says the Lord of hosts: ‚ÄúBehold, disaster shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the farthest parts of the earth.<br /><br />Ezekiel <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhBNQqAmflc&amp;t=13m13s"">13:13</a><br />Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‚ÄúI will cause a stormy wind to break forth in My fury; and there shall be a flooding rain in My anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume it.<br /><br />The Spirit and the bride,<br />Mount Zion, the Heavenly Jerusalem<br />Gabriel riah"

Comment165	"Now I told you a about the strong delusion from God 2 Thessalonians <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhBNQqAmflc&amp;t=2m10s"">2:10</a>-12 it is sort of explained in 1 Corinthians <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhBNQqAmflc&amp;t=1m27s"">1:27</a>-31. Now if you didn&#39;t believe that strong delusion has begun, remember when T.I went to prison and got out and started speaking at churches? He recently made a song with Teyana Taylor called Be there. I assure you real, hardened criminals go to prison and hell because they believe in the broad path not the narrow righteous path. The righteous scarcely make it remember? So where and with who you choose to spend your eternity with is totally on you. A political God who can work miracles will be in office presiding over the entire world soon to offer you his name or number of his name in your right hand or forehead. Those who were pure in heart saw that death was better than life with the wickedness of the world. Eccl.4:2-3, Proverbs 31:6-7 Strong drink for your heavy heart."

Comment216	Unfortunately, being one of the greatest countries here in East Asia, Japan bears the heaviest brunt of sea storms, earthquakes, and tsunamis. But I applaud the determination of this nation, they face one of the fiercest natural catastrophes on Earth, and they are as resilient as ever. For the rest of us, this is a warning that climate change is underway!
Comment 216.1	@jahag kagau The concern is pretty legit for the small country of Maldives, as well as the fact that the rising seas are also a direct impact of global warming. But the pity in all this is that politicians and agendist folks are still working hard to make climate change a hoax - would you believe that in 2019? This is something that I am terrified about
Comment 216.2	It&#39;s been underway for a while, even if every country took a hard stance to climate change ( reducing CO2 emissions to basically nothing), the sea would still rise by 60cm.<br />During spring when the tide is highest along with a storm this number changes to 120cms, Say good by to the Maldives!

Comment 225.1	No
Comment 225.2	Typhoon of this magnitude happens every 60 years in Japan, last one killed 1,200 people and that was much much bigger. This typhoon was due, thats why Japan has spent decades building an underground river beneath tokyo preparing for this one. This is why Tokyo was not destroyed last night even though the eye of the typhoon went right through Tokyo.

Comment253	just nuke the typhoon lol
Comment254	"The sad thing is, damages caused by larger typhoons due to global warming was already predicted more than 20 years ago.  In recent years, Japan has been hit by large Typhoons causing flooding and landslides, but it has been rare that the Kanto area (Area around Tokyo) or further North was affected. In an ironical way, we were lucky to have been hit by a large Typhoon about a month ago, which let people be more prepared this time. However, it&#39;s still heartbreaking for the people who lost friends and relatives, and people who lost their homes.<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhBNQqAmflc&amp;t=2m10s"">2:10</a> For Rugby fans, there is good news. The match between Scotland and Japan is going to go ahead as planned.<br />Business as usual....."
Comment 254.1	@SK SK shut up you korean shit.
Comment 254.2	Climate change is a lie. The great tribulation is coming on account of sin. But also Jesus is coming for his people. God is behind all these things, and the prophecies are being fulfilled as written thousands of years ago. The truth is out there but is not found in the crooked media.

Comment 258.1	AnimeLoverForever Victoria the whole world is wicked. True believers in Yeshua are the minority. As you can clearly see from this comments these people are blind,lost, arrogant, prideful and believe in the traditions of man. Don‚Äôt worry once demascus falls and Russia Emp America and America is a dark wasteland maybe then some will get it that if you deny the father your life is meaningless. I hope y‚Äôall repent before it‚Äôs too late. It‚Äôs about to get much worse. This world has been run by wicked too long<br /><br />And there‚Äôs no such thing as religion, only truth JESUS IS TRUTH. There‚Äôs only truth and those who deny the truth that‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs no compartmentalzing ‚Äúoh that just religion and this is the real world‚Äù NO IF YOU DONT FOLLOW JESUS YOUR FOLLOWING SATAN there‚Äôs no in between. And Everyone who wishes separation from the most high will get exactly what they desire in the abyss.
Comment 258.2	@Carl Nebrin you know that it&#39;s not because of religious right? If for example Europe and Japan were switched then the typhoon would get to Europe even if a lot of people are Christian here.
Comment 258.3	@YV Monte Amen
Comment 258.4	Carl Nebrin amen brother they have no idea the hell that is coming <br /><br /><br />Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.<br />Ezekiel 12:2
Comment 258.5	@Adromedox They called Jesus worse.
Comment259	Go atone for yr war crimes sincerity n the typhoons severity will reduced whether u believe or not..Satellites can track typhoons but u cannot predict its path even with the most advance sensors n records also inaccurate. Ie 50% science n 50% act of god. If denial of war crimes has not been so much under abe govt. Then maybe some typhoons could hv been avoided.<br />Those ppl yr troops killed in ww2 would certainly hv wanted some revenge even fr their graves..<br />And this typhoons is the start of more 2 come..<br />Start knowing what is right n wrong don&#39;t fool yrself tt man can control everything.

Comment284	What is going on every day it‚Äôs something
Comment 284.1	AnimeLoverForever Victoria don‚Äôt apologize to me. Apologize to your own soul for denying the father who loves you. You would see plenty of proof if you did research instead of writing it off everytime. If you paid attention you would research and see the demonic things the elite of this world do to serve their God Satan. You think this life is free this is a test. Spiritual warfare Satan wants to trap as many souls as possible so you suffer with him. Fail or pass your choice!
Comment 284.2	@YV Monte so sorry I don&#39;t believe in a book that was found once and for all we know could have been written as a children&#39;s book back then. If I would have actual proof I would believe it.
Comment 284.3	AnimeLoverForever Victoria you ignorance blinds you. For this world is cursed with evil. Evil is good and good is evil. So those who know the truth about the most high are deemed crazy and those who deny him are deemed ‚Äúnormal‚Äù all the proof going on around you that this world is ending and you can‚Äôt see because you act with boundless arrogance! TIME TO REPENT your ego and lack of research will be the reason for the damning of your soul and it‚Äôs sad
