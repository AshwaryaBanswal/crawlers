Comment1	Perhaps the British do not feel the pain of Hong Kong people
Comment2	BBC Fake news
Comment3	These rioters and terrorists do not fight for Hong Kong right or freedom, but only their own selfish interest. They are afraid to compete with their peers in Mainland after having fallen behind in recent years and are simply jealous of the success of others. <br /><br />The real issue here is they lack the opportunities and competitiveness when compared to their counterparts in a global economy and market. When you can&#39;t beat the opposition, the easiest and fastest way is to literally engage a thug to break the leg of your competition....a simple case of Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan.
Comment4	Probably, they must accept Tennō. &#39;cause they attached me from far, with Zen religion. Your Riot pulled me back to here again. But, all men seems be Mao Zedong. It&#39;s exactly Leninism. Who will be formalin ever?  Quit for warmingly to Northen expedition. It&#39;s stupid sex dope licker past Soviet Caucasian with nonverbal communication. It&#39;s not peaceful deal from upper, proofed Alexander&#39;s divorced. Then, you need to nuclear bombs here Gifu, Japan as Hiroshima. It&#39;s same history from my family, sad.<br />I will escape... &#39;cause Japan uses me. I&#39;m perfect defence system when I&#39;m here in Japan. I&#39;m abused, is weapon, when I&#39;m here.<br />I think... Hong Kong guys are wrongly heading to conflict, seems  democide. it&#39;s not your deal, rather Japan must do.
Comment5	Free Scotland !

Comment7	支持中國🇨🇳香港警察!
Comment8	"<a href=""https://youtu.be/JMCK96tKpps"">https://youtu.be/JMCK96tKpps</a> every Sat our South Korea going for blue house."
Comment9	Shame you, BBC, FAKE NEWS, SHIT MEDIA
Comment10	A little TOO LATE
Comment11	journalists should be simple news communicators, but lots of western journalists deliberately turn to news selectors、distorters、even participants themselves, totally break the basic principle of journalism, that&#39;s why so many people have got misled and brainwashed, in some sense those journalists actually have become chaos makers.
Comment12	Hong Kong is a blessed place, the most free place, People are free to enter and exit, Funds are free to enter and exit,... Business can be freely traded, Renminbi, foreign currency can be freely circulated, What financial products are available, all can be freely traded, and what financial products are spurred by the enthusiasm of the dream is developed, the double exhibition is small, and the financial thugs are tempting. Hong Kong is a spy paradise, which is the great value of Hong Kong. Hong Kong&#39;s wealth is a financing center. Hong Kong is an interest group (black and white), and property hegemony has plundered huge wealth. Hong Kong&#39;s surplus value, everyone loves it, Hong Kong&#39;s status is rock solid, value is incomparable, what are you worried about? ? Nowadays, there is wine now drunk!
Comment13	Shame BBC. Hong kong protests are just protests with out casualties of citizens....but extra coverage is given to it because of china....the west and chaina tussel is not hidden from the world......On the other side more vigorus protests are made by kashmiris in iok against indian forces...for more than 80 days kashmiris have been boxed in by india and about 30 kashmiri protesters have yet been killed by indian occupying forces in three months.....but BBC...CNN... and other anti chaina channels are showning a non issue in bankok as breaking news...but the gross human right violations by india in kashmir have  been ignored.... shame west shame....
Comment14	BBC Catalonia people needs YOU, WHY U NOT REPORTING THEM???  THEY ARE NOT DESERVING DEMOCRACY????!!!!
Comment15	American blessings to HK.
Comment16	Praying to Hong Kong Protestors from Iraqi Protestors
Comment17	The demonstrators attacked first to police, you can see clearly that. I really think as it&#39;s logical, that Hong Kong belongs to China. That&#39;s was the deal with Britain and everyone accepted. Like a contract. Sorry! ;)
Comment 17.1	@Matt Doak Yes, incoherent, irrelevant. You are a pretentious ignorant fool. End. Bye.
Comment 17.2	@Manuel Mancilla Hurtado irrelevant; this conversation is being conducted in english, and you said your point was clearly conveyed, using english.<br /><br />Don&#39;t pull that nonsense with me, neophyte.
Comment 17.3	@Matt Doak Matt, first of all, do you speak another language beyond English?
Comment 17.4	@Manuel Mancilla Hurtado you did? Ok, guess I&#39;m the one who was speaking incoherently. Let&#39;s try it your way.<br /><br />Is what has go for Hong Kong so now? If CCP love people of will what soon then? Why not live with same and it will come too?
Comment 17.5	@Matt Doak I expressed myself clearly, maybe you are the one with a lack of knowledge so you see it &quot;incoherent&quot;
Comment18	Old news. Everyone know it is not the bill.
Comment19	“Police will not stop their attempts to stop the protesters”. How can those words come out of your mouth Jonathan ?
Comment20	Bbc have you tried to listen to yourself? Do you have shame?

Comment30	Hong Kong government: <b>Breath</b><br />Hong Kong mobs: How dare you! You are taking freedom from us! Let&#39;s spend next whole week protesting this corrupt government.
Comment 30.1	commie Chinglish! Tell your master get a better commie script for you to write here
Comment31	it’s riot！just like the riot in Chile
Comment 31.1	Only china criminal party calls the HK Movement riot but not the whole world, Haaaa
Comment32	we are all tired with these chicken-eagle games, just do something to prevent Hongkong from constant instability! the immaturity of protesters and lacking in decision from the government makes the situation worse and worse.  nobody nowadays believe it was a extraction issue but effectively  invisible hands were behind these chaos for months.
Comment33	you media is 💩。伪善的傻逼非说自己是自由民主，真恶心
Comment34	Hello everyone. Know that Chinese police is reported to be dressing up as civilians and making the protestors look bad in the media. Know to not just trust one newssource. Know that Chinese police have been using chemical weapons that killed multiple animals including cats and dogs. Know that this is a war on the freedom of Hong Kong. Know that the Chinese police have been using chemical weapons and violence on press and bystanding civilians. Know to think critically on things that Chinese media claims about the protests. It is a dangerous world out there but will be more dangerous if Hong Kong loses this war. Also look up tiananmen squire if you want to now what China is capable of. Good luck everyone!!!
Comment35	你的心是自由的。有勇氣去追隨它。香港人，我們都死了，這只是一個如何和為什麼的問題。人都會死，不是每個人都真的活著。我是美國愛國者！我看到香港同胞和婦女全軍，他們無視暴政。你來到[抗議]作為自由的男人和女人...和自由的男人和女人，你是。你會怎麼處理這種自由？你會戰鬥?....,戰鬥，你可能會死。跑，你會活下來...至少一段時間死在病床上，許多年後，你會願意交易所有的日子，從今天到那，一個機會，只有一個機會，回到香港，告訴共產主義的中國，他們可能會奪去你的生命，但他們永遠不會採取...你的自由！
Comment36	Hong Kong People, We all end up dead, it’s just a question of how and why. Every man dies, not every man really lives.I am An American Patriot! And I see a whole army of Hong Kong  countrymen and Women, there  in defiance of tyranny. You’ve come to [protest] &lt;fight&gt; as free men and Women … and free men and women you are. What will you do with that freedom? Will you fight?...., fight and you may die. Run, and you’ll live… at least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willin’ to trade ALL the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back to Hong Kong  and tell   communist  China  that they may take your lives, but they’ll never take… YOUR FREEDOM!
Comment37	Idiot Hongkonger want to be our western dogs lol.
Comment 37.1	Kendo Pa dog is too nice a word for them. They are f@@@ retarded.
Comment38	China destroys West Philippine Sea. China becoming stupid.
Comment39	All these people are criminal activists....genuine protesters only voice their concerns they don&#39;t vandalise.
Comment 39.1	@Jacob Watson Anyone or Anybody Vandalise a buildings or destroying something that he doesn&#39;t own is classified as a criminal. In Australia you will be prosecuted, and your HK people is lucky that Xi Jingping didn&#39;t arrest all of you.
Comment 39.2	Eric Tran Yeah, and by that logic those who participated in the French or Haitian Revolutions are also criminals right?😂😂😂
Comment40	It continues to be amazing to see the American flag waving people of Hong Kong risk everything to defend their freedoms while ignorant spoiled brats in America burn American flags promoting the thuggish Socialist/Communist system the Chinese use to terrorize, imprison and murder their own people.
Comment41	Reporters from BBC are just so unprofessional and straight liars.
Comment 41.1	Liberate Hong Kong!
Comment42	Hey, how about Barcelona?
Comment43	Free HK
Comment44	Chinese government paying a bounty on protesters for the re-education camps.  Organ donor demand is at an all time high.
Comment45	Fight for freedom, stand with Catalonia, Scotland and California
Comment 45.1	Shawn Sun California?
Comment 45.2	Shawn Sun Scotland? They had their referendum five years ago.....
Comment46	Thank you for a better coverage!
Comment47	The Chinese government dogs infiltrate the protesters group.  The government&#39;s generated chaos and misinformation is a common communist ploy.
Comment 47.1	Keep dreaming Neuropathy
Comment48	for catalonia, for scotland, for freedom.
Comment 48.1	Previous month I managed to receive my first five figure income ever!!! I&#39;ve been working for this company on-line for 2 years now and I never been happier... They are paying me $95 per hour, and the best thing regarding it is the fact I am not really that tech-savvy, they only asked for basic knowledge about internet and common typing skill...Amazing thing about this work is that I have more free time for my loved ones. I am in a position to devote quality time with my relatives and buddies and look after my children and also going on vacation together with them very routinely. Don&#39;t avoid this chance and make sure to respond fast. This is what I do... <b>explore486­.­c­o­m</b>
Comment49	No riots today Friday 25th
Comment50	I am a Hongkonger.  My whole family lives in Hong Kong for more than 100 years.  Hong Kong has democracy, our democracy is different from western.  Our democracy is called hyperdemocracy.  Look！Those rioters beat up polices, destroyed police station, destroyed public facilities, one of the polices’ finger was bitten off by a rioter and the rioter damaged one of the police’s bollock, chopped a Police, burned a police, beat up ordinary innocent Hongkongers.  Can anyone ask the Human right organization to stop those rioters to destroy Hong Kong and stop them bullying Hong Kong ordinary people and polices.  Hong Kong police officers are Hong Kong People too.  Hong Kong Polices worked non-stop 36 hours for those rioters day by day, under the hot sun, around 30 degrees. Now, Hong Kong people look at those rioters (protesters) in disgust.  Hong Kong people call them Cockroaches.  <br /><br />Those so called protesters, in fact that they were rioters.  And those rioters were engaging some events, they called it “ Nang Chow “ not Chowmein (Chinese style fried noodle).  The meaning of Nang Chow is to make any misinformation and lie in order to continually create chaos in Hong Kong.  Some of the rioters were paid to make those chaos and instigate the others.  And some of the youths was brainwashed.  I just watched Cult in Explain from Netflix. Almost the same as what is happening in HK.  Some youths said if they did not go protesting, they would be bullied by their peer, they have peer pressure. And the leaders of the riot kept promoting the belief of value judgement rather than a constructive work.  Their dear leaders of the riot keep doing the soft sell to those youths.  And they used enormous lies to create an Enemy, they see polices, government are their enemy. The rioters and the leaders tried very hard to damage the reputation of Hong Kong Police Force.  Some youths even departed from their family to be rioters.  They do not listen their family anymore.  Their dear leaders of the riot keep telling those youths the New Reality and promoting more violence. What the heck of this?<br /><br />US and England invaded Iraq in 2003. Media goes silent afterwards. And enormous misleading and fake news were spreading around the world like a wave.  Look at Iraq today.  And I learnt something “Never ever take the side of the outsiders against your own government”.  <br /><br />Those rioters (so called protesters) said they have set up a new government in Hong Kong and those rioters are the police force in Hong Kong now.  And all the Hong Kong people’s assets are belong to them.  They are really retarted!!! The biggest joke in this century, they really a joke!<br /><br />Hong Kong was a peaceful place.  China government and Mainland Chinese very mush respect Hong Kong and Hong Kong people. The unemployment rate of Hong Kong before the unrest was 2.8%,  According to the  economics, It is called fully employment.  2.8% was a friction rate.  And our rating of S&amp;P was AA+.  It is true the youths were not easy to buy a house in Hong Kong.  However, the housing problem was in all the countries around the world, not only Hong Kong.  Please dig up your memory, who creates this freaking quantitative easing.  The whole true behind the unrest was somebody tried very hard to not let our Government to build more public housing and the foreign force does not like the extradition.  The whole true behind the extradition is a woman was killed by her bf in Taiwan.  Taiwan urged HK Government to send back that freaking guy to Taiwan.  Taiwan urged Hong Kong three times.  That freaking murder is in Hong Kong now, and was released.  Without the extradition, HK government is no way to send him to Taiwan for hearing.  And the foreign force sees it as an entry point to make this freaking chaos in Hong Kong.  As I said my whole family lives in HK for more than 100 years.  Thus, I need to make sure everyone realised the true of the chaos in Hong Kong.
Comment 50.1	France has yellow vests, Hong Kong has yellow ribbons, England has yellow panties and Spain has yellow toilet papers.  What’s next.......!  <br />The foreign force envies you then handles you!  I named those movements to “Global Drop Dead” i.e., 普世仆直！
Comment 50.2	Thanks for telling the truth.
Comment 50.3	In the beginning I started off supporting these so called protesters for their peaceful protest but when they became more and more violent and more and more illogical.. <br />I am a Chinese from Malaysia and am so disgusted with these rioters or simply gangsters.. I support the government but they are too lenient towards the protesters..<br />Hong Kong is going down the drain and all because of America who is playing this political game.. <br />These rioters are so stupid that in the end of the day.. Hong Kong is part of China.. they may fight and fight to try and get what they want.. but they should know they can never win this battle.. <br />Last and not least..by 2047..!! It will become one country one system..if these rioters don&#39;t like this country.. Just leave and go to Canada or Australia or Africa.. are they going to fight for the next 27 years..<br />A bunch of SOAR HAI been manipulated by America.!! Besides why are Chinese fighting Chinese... What a shame..!
Comment51	You made a very basic mistake. Believe me, most people in Hong Kong don’t identify with Chinese at all. There is something wrong about their sense of identity cuz they have long been colonized and exposed to western culture and western-style governance, which is totally different from mainland China, where has the deepest convention of totalitarian. But we Chinese citizens cannot accept any kind of separatist because we have the longest history as a unified country, which is considered as one the supreme value in our culture. If looking back into our history, it will be very clear that we started so many wars against separation resolutely. Generally, we are very mild, but when it comes to war against separation, Chinese men will go to the front zone without second thought, even giving their lives. That is my thoughts toward the protests in HK. They are entitled to stand up for their rights and fight for freedom. But never cross the line, which is the nonfiction of our country. Hong Kong is really too small to be crushed under such a huge and powerful wheel.
Comment52	So they are protecting criminals from extradition? SCUMS
Comment 52.1	@Dušan Xmetov Which is why extradition laws exist, so that anyone has to be tried in their own country first.<br />In fact, you don&#39;t have to be an authoritarian regime to call anyone &quot;an Enemy of the People&quot;.<br />Meng Wanzhou, Julian Assange and Edward Snowden have all been called &#39;an Enemy of the People&#39; and all of them have been sought extradition for.<br />And they were highly sought for unlike Chan-Tong kai.<br />So now we have a Taiwanese government and a Hong Kong crowd that doesn&#39;t want a murderer be brought to justice for choking his girlfriend to death and dumping her body in a ditch for cheating, while Canada wants to extradite a lady to the US for answering &quot;no&quot; to a question asked in Singapore about a Malaysian company involved in transferring money to Iran via an Emirate payment processer that has a server in the US and therefore the US government finds it justified that she commited a crime in the US.
Comment 52.2	Mainland China is an authoritarian regime, they can call anyone &quot;an Enemy of the People&quot;
Comment53	Why are they using a picture of Bruno Mars in an I luv HK t-shirt to advertise this video?
Comment54	Westerners!.......<br />Don&#39;t think for a moment that this is a CCP problem, ... no not so..... not a Chinese problem per se, at all.<br />What we see here, is what will always happen when very powerful states, come into being....<br />Central planning, central control, codification of decisions, and the inevitable centralised garnering of people&#39;s resources via taxation lead to a cacophony of powerful interests, focusing on a tiny goal.<br />Western countries, like Australia, USA, the Americas and Europe north and south etc have grappled with this growing problem, all this time, pretty much unsuccessfully.....<br />When a state becomes powerful enough, its leaders move from being covert Narcissists to overt Narcissists, and the decline to psychopathy can be very rapid. <br />Look out and be warned. <br />Big states, centrally controlled bureaucracies and the gathering of vast taxation resources, inevitably leads to these results.<br />Nothing will stop this form of extreme conflict, except for various reset scenarios.

Comment56	The world now knows better and more than these western owned bias news.
Comment57	Fake news
Comment 57.1	Fake news, is that when people don&#39;t like or agree with whats being reported, so they call it fake news. Trump said it was fake news when his car passed through Parliament Sq, some months ago, and he said he saw no protesters, even though there were protesters. he called it at press conference later, fake news. It seems to me these words &quot;fake news&#39; are being over used.
Comment58	Why always focus on HK? Free Scotland. u guys should do the same. Free Scotland!! Free North Ireland!!!! u guys need learn how to protest like HK.
Comment59	Freedom for hong Kong
Comment60	Communism is like cancer, it kills.
Comment 60.1	A bit like capitalism
Comment 60.2	This is not communism tho
Comment61	RECLAIM THE MAINLAND
Comment62	I think i have a job to do
Comment63	"<a href=""https://youtu.be/S2tnk1XH-s4"">https://youtu.be/S2tnk1XH-s4</a>"
Comment64	Even though the law has been taken away, the rioters will still riot. Got to earn those U.S. $$$
Comment 64.1	@Matt Doak still waiting dude..guess you won&#39;t reply as you are out of your depth and have no argument. Release all the criminals is human right LOL Right not to be called a criminal when you break the law is a human right LOL
Comment 64.2	@Matt Doak come on then tell how the five demands map to the U.N. charter on human rights? You didn&#39;t because they don&#39;t. Simply stating they do, unfortunately doesn&#39;t make it so. Dear me you are a dreamer.
Comment 64.3	Again, the demands absolutely address human rights abuses. You&#39;re being absurd to claim otherwise, and this shows me that attempting to lay it out for you would be a complete waste of my time.<br /><br />No, you&#39;re right; they&#39;re just being payed by the CIA.<br /><br />Have a good one.
Comment 64.4	@Matt Doak please map each of the five demands against the U.N. basic human charter for me then. <br /><br />Yes, thought so, not a single one. Your obviously much more obtuse than I can ever hope to be.
Comment 64.5	@Bob Grout I guess you&#39;re being willfully obtuse, as the demands absolutely correspond with basic human rights.
Comment65	HongKongers: fighting for freedom <br />Chinese: fighting for government/ communist President Xi
Comment 65.1	@R wi The only thing I said was that there is no fight for freedom, there is a fight against a law that was there to punish criminals... All there is in HK now are just riots! What is your argument cause atm I have feeling you are trolling me -.-
Comment 65.2	Dario Sting yeah yeah democracy is an ideology
Comment 65.3	@R wi &quot;We fight for a better life, not an ideology.&quot; This is what you said! Your first comment on this thread! Since you applied &quot;fight&quot; and it was said in the context of riots and that&#39;s why  I said there is no fight for freedom nor  fight for a better life in riots happening in Hk!
Comment 65.4	Dario Sting now wish me a good luck mate
Comment 65.5	Dario Sting China is not my enemy my biggest enemy is myself. I have no time to fight against an ideology or a government . When I take down my laziness inside of me I will have a better life
Comment66	Jonathan is just wasting money being in Hong Kong when he really thinks that the extradition bill is the real reason behind the riots... 😂😂😂
Comment67	中国好,20个左右都没关系
Comment68	They wear t-shirt says they love HK but then they turn around setting subway stations on fire and beating up whoever don’t agree with them on the street. They call it “democracy”. Seriously?
Comment 68.1	Felt like it’s a almost an excuse now, I saw a video where the protestors just smashed a random restaurant and thrown in a Molotov apparently that was to fight for “democracy?”
Comment69	Human history, The biggest drug dealer
Comment70	BBC garbage
Comment71	A hundred years building Hong Kong up into the amazing success it was, both culturally and financially....then give it to China for 5 minutes and it&#39;s completely ruined.
Comment 71.1	@Dario Sting You just ignored everything I said. Answer my questions, which Chinese city was better than Hong Kong before 1997? <br />Hong Kong has protests every single year ever since the handover, getting bigger and bigger and their poverty is by far the worst ever since the handover.<br />You proved my first comment correct, China ruined HK in just a short time. The wonderful city under British rule that gave us Bruce Lee, John Wu, amazing cinema and Hong Kong culture. The famous prospering city, despite being so small, totally ruined by China.
Comment 71.2	@loot6 Your argument, there were no protests, I give an example, and all you see &quot; COMMUNISM&quot;... Okey! This protest started why? Tell me! I really want to hear the reason why this protest started! Hint: When you say &quot;extradition bill&quot;, also explain why there was a need for it (I want you to mention that murder in Taiwan)!<br />And yeah, let&#39;s start viewing this from another viewpoint than communism and capitalism shall we?
Comment 71.3	@Dario Sting That one single protest was also &quot;Instigated by events in the People&#39;s Republic of China (PRC)&quot;. It was all people from the PRC causing the trouble. I think we&#39;ll blame this protest on the CCP as well.
Comment72	Fight for freedom, stand with IRA! Go free North Ireland!
Comment73	BBC is good at telling lies, making fake news.  Look at how you report the &quot;peaceful&quot; protests in the UK and Spain.  No wonder we, Chinese, say, &quot;go back home and mind your own businesses&quot;.
Comment74	I know there is violation of human rights in hong kong....<br /><br />But they already knew they are in communist country that have binding constitution....<br /><br />So my question is, where hongkong when they colonialized by UK? Are they stand for their right and freedom back then? Why they do not do some referendum back then to seize their independence or at least their democratic system?<br /><br />Where hongkong when some nationalist in china fight for their freedom and independence? And where is hongkong when china invade tibet? Are they fight for it too as same side that fight against china? Because if you want independence, freedom, and democratic system you must fight for it from beginning and show to other country that you fight for it too, to gain alliance and international awereness...<br /><br />So if you just fight it for now, sorry to say you just fight it for yourself because you see it more beneficiary than communist system, and because you just fight it now, your act is against your country constitution which is communist system and that mean you are somekind of separatist because you want to change your country ideology,law system, and constitution
Comment75	Northern Ireland should learn from Hong Kong and go to the street to ask for independence....
Comment 75.1	charlie Quek Northern Ireland, Independent? Hahahahahahahaha, that comment just shows how little you know about the situation in Northern Ireland. It’s union or unification, independence is never in a billion years gonna happen.
Comment76	Stand with HONG KONG!
Comment77	China impatience had broken the HK ‘Bonsai’.<br />Now it will takes many more years to recover.<br />Maybe never will.
Comment78	Whole world will have protests. It is the in-thing. Not happy with anything, protest and destroy more things so more people will have more reasons to be angry, more protests. Total stupidity.
Comment79	UK, Scotland and Ireland also need your continuous care
Comment80	"Should have been scrapped months ago <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23free"">#free</a> Hong Kong fight for freedom!"
Comment 80.1	@Josh Borat You do know that the reason law was put in the first place because a citizen of HK committed murder of his girlfriend and his unborn child in Taiwan, and after coming to HK, he admitted his crime. Since it was in Taiwan, ONLY TAIWAN can prosecute him, not HK. So HK decided to put the extradition bill to make that happen. I mean, dude killed his UNBORN CHILD! The reason why protest began was bcs some fool said Chinese will use that bill to enslave HK -.- It&#39;s not like HK will become part of China in 2047 -.-
Comment 80.2	@Dario Sting Ahh yes because protesters and murderers are totally the same and not the authoritarian ccp
Comment 80.3	Freedom for murderers? Good job! Lets fight for that &quot;freedom&quot;!
Comment81	America needs a mass protest on the&quot;lawmakers&quot;not doing what is wanted by American citizens! Better yet a TAX BOYCOTT!!<br />DO YOUR JOB!!!
Comment82	"democracy or eternal conflict keap going. either government give in or <a href=""https://youtu.be/N2xaluuCiks"">https://youtu.be/N2xaluuCiks</a>"
Comment83	Free Catalonia !!
Comment84	This is old  news

Comment86	IS A BIG INSULT TO 1S LOGIC , AREN&#39;T THE FORMER COLONIAL INVADERS WHO ARE CAUSING THIS MESS IN HONG KONG ? <br />SAME ENTITIES UNTIL TODAY PRACTICING HEGEMONIC TRADE THROUGH THE SAME TERRITORIES ?
Comment87	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AJCXF6flYY&amp;t=0m25s"">0:25</a>  look at that fringe, LOL. I mean, care more about Spain. BBC is such a cuckhold"
Comment88	DO war No free HongKong go to communist armee
Comment 88.1	Piss off dullard
Comment89	Free Catalonia
Comment90	You&#39;re quiet on brexit now remainers have seen their own arse 😂😂😂
Comment91	Events have overtaken the hot issue of the extradition law that sparked the protests. The guy  has opted to go to Taiwan to face trial for the alleged murder case.Curry lamb made a big mistake to introduce the contentious law. She is now in a hot soup to handle the crisis situation that is ruining Hong Kong . A failed leader who cannot communicate with the people.
Comment 91.1	More like people that dont even understand why are they protesting...
Comment92	No laws after the British left. This is part of the reality of China govern.
Comment93	A bit surprised bbc actually admit that normal hong kongers view the violence as trouble
Comment94	Really odd that the riots had just hopped on that Universal Suffrage thing. What have they been thinking (or being told) that mess was all about?
Comment95	Die free Hongkongers!
Comment96	We need people like this in the United States. Nothing says I&#39;m motivated and want change like throwing Molotov cocktails at a police station.
Comment 96.1	I believe the numbers for US right now is 13%. Hong Kong has 20% of people living at poverty level. So who knows, any country will revolt against it&#39;s leaders, it&#39;s just a matter of time.<br /><br />Holy crap Venezuela is 90%<br />Spain 22% poverty<br />France 14% and they have a history of cutting the head of their leaders<br /><br />Id say Venezuela will change leadership in 9 months. US will revolt, if the government take away the guns. State of California will revolt in 9 months and Texas will revolt against Mexico, again
Comment 96.2	@Ron Tailwind and you actually think us Americans will fight the tyranny going on by the government. 😂 Maybe the founding fathers generation
Comment 96.3	Forget Molotov, we have guns. The riots don&#39;t usually start until 60% of the population are below poverty.

Comment102	The opposition party took advantage of citizens’ fear of being extradited to China for trial as simple as posting anti-China commentary online. The fear sparked off the protest.

Comment110	Hilter was selected as a leader after a democratic election. Hence, political system does not automatically equate justice, equality, and freedom. The only things that a society should truly treasure are its people, unique culture, institutional system with the rule of law, and infrastructure. Without these core assets, the society will not survive regardless of political system.
Comment 110.1	You heard some idiot saying that Hitler was elected and you believe it. Man check the facts first. A stable democracy is the only system that stops authoritarian leaders from doing bad to their people. At the end the only thing an authoritarian government is trying to install all kinds of mechanisms to keep their power. Outcome is no freedom of speech and society that is split in two.
Comment111	Prayers with Harry Dunn. BBC had been in support to extradict Anne Sacoolas back to UK to serve justice...
Comment 111.1	When  did  the  BBC say they had been in support top extradict  Anna Sacoolas ?. The only reports I have seen/heard on the BBC are news reports on the  matter, I never heard words saying, &quot;we at the BBC support Anne Sacoolas should  be extradicted back to the UK&quot;.
Comment112	The Taiwan case just an excuse for those communist sperms in mainland to get the extradition law pass so they can execute any political opponents in HK against the regime, and surely that any one sent  to the mainland will disappear without a trace. You just can&#39;t trust those communist sperms - Stalin, Mao, Kim they all use this tactic and Xi would not be exceptional.

Comment 119.1	because they are getting violent. ive kept up to date with this from the start and it has escalated. i do stand by the protesters in what they stand for, but you dont ambush people out in the street, you dont beat old civilians in the street because they have different views to you, and you dont try and set someone alight. i understand fighting back against your oppressor but dont going out of your way to cause lifetime injuries or kill someone

Comment 133.1	"@Bob Grout I think you mean HK. Extreme police brutality is not only in the last 4 months, this clip is from 5 years ago. At that time people only had umbrellas, are you saying they should just take it and like it?<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so1SdZmZuvc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so1SdZmZuvc</a>"
Comment 133.2	@Christopher Banigan Not really sure what 1968 Chicago has to do with things. Clearly the police in UK are too soft, and clearly some sections of the protest movement are rioters. You just can&#39;t argue it.
Comment 133.3	After the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention, it was determined that there was a police riot, this is what is happening in Hong Kong as well without a proper enquiry. One of the bystanders pepper sprayed and dyed blue outside a Kowloon mosque said as far as he was concerned, the police are the ones who are rioting.
Comment134	No to all asylum seekers
Comment135	To me personally, it is highly commendable the way Chinese Central Government has acted/ acting during this entire scenario. CGC proved to the entire global community beyond ALL/ Every resonable doubt they act and took carrying out measures to find a solution to the ongoing misdemeanor by respecting all Hong Kong communities in an utmost responsible manner. Absolutely awesome. in the US, the cops shoot and kill innocent civilians for minor errors or mostly for no reason. So all in all Chinese Central Government should be respected and commended for their professional, humane, and civilized way of tackling this idiotic , dumb, ignorant behavior of   the few hong kong chines community, Who think their way of thinking is far more superior than any chinese. Stupid idiots. All these Hong Kong chinese community who destabilize Hong Kong should be tried in the court of law for treason and should be given life in jail sentences. Period. The dammage they have caused for Hong Kong is irreversible and mind boggling.
Comment 135.1	@Brian Pan How is that off point, it speaks directly to the repressive CPP regime that youth don&#39;t want to suffer under.
Comment 135.2	Christopher Banigan Off point. He wasn’t saying or addressing that. That’s Apple and oranges.
Comment 135.3	Have you ever considered why there is a revolution and what motivates Hong Kong youth? Here is one reason:<br />five Hong Kong bookstore owners were kidnapped by communist Chinese public security bureau agents only to reappear years later in mainland prisons. This rendition happened without an extradition law in place–imagine if they could arrest anyone they felt like and render them to be incarcerated for thought crimes. Try talking openly you are here  in Emperor Xi (Winnie the Pooh) land–they would shut you up permanently. Treason indeed.
Comment136	Why don&#39;t you go n report more about your neighbour , Catalan protest instead of poking yr nose into China&#39;s affair. BBC used to be a fair n unbiased media but after watching the HK protest on BBC, I think they are no difference from those American mainstream media, biased n post edited video to mislead the viewer. I have now switch to  watch CNA news instead of BBC.

CCP lies and myths wont work in liberal and free world as HK and the WEST !! Listen to the People and NOT simply what rulers and Xi Jinping in beijing want!! Puppet Carrie at the beginning of the mess was blaming her masters that she has given no autonomy over Hong Kong....After US Congress passes &quot;HK Human Rights and Democracy Acts&quot;, Carrie and HK police dogs&#39; attitudes on the HK Movement immediately take a sharp turn and become soften and more humane, strange!

When is China gonna give Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong their referendums? Never? Ah right, so much for your “freedom”.
Comment163	China feels that if they ease issues that cause protests , that Trump will ease sanctions.  There definitely is a loss in translation as for what Trump wishes.  <br /><br /><br />Trump&#39;s biggest fight is with Deep State...if China was forthcoming on issues that caused China&#39;s woes in the first place...which was ridiculous promises by Deep State...then they&#39;d reap what they sowed from that harvest most magnificently.  <br /><br /><br />Faith is the Deep State will seal their fate.

Comment 170.3	@Kelvin Lim personally I disagree with them. The UK is supposed to be a sovereign nation. However, Hong Kong IS part of China. Tbh my view on the Hong Kong situation might be changing. But I just hope the violence would stop on both sides. That&#39;s all

So because of the bill which is just a formality because China has no integrity and dopes what they want anyway you want the protestors to stop? For more about the murders which officials are calling &quot;suicides&quot; go to a youtube channel called Voice of Guo media he is a former CCP member who lives in the US now. He has intelligence inside of Hong Kong and reports on it from the US. Check out his channel.

Comment 183.3	"I know what you mean Ray. Different media outlets have been saying for a while now that the Extradition Bill was &quot;withdrawn.&quot; When I heard this, I looked into it and found out that the bill had been <i>withdrawn</i> but not &quot;terminated.&quot; This meant that the Hong Kong government could re-introduce the bill later. Apparently, the word &quot;terminated&quot; is &quot;formally withdrawn&quot; (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AJCXF6flYY&amp;t=0m04s"">0:04</a>) 😑"

Comment187	I hope they are happy! Law that was to ensure a guy who killed his girlfriend and unborn child gets his punishment, was scrapped and guy is free to roam streets of HK! If he decides not to go to Taiwan to be prosecuted, HK cant force him to Taiwan :D<br />Stupidity of protesters has reached climax!!! First of all, their system was left by British, so every blame should fall on British, not China!! Second of all, they will join China in 2047! What is purpose of this Riots? Making sure China sends army and conquers HK in 2047 by spilling blood?

Comment 203.1	9871ification  I think thats the stubborness of  you HK people showing, you pressumed and speculated about a lot of things and tend to believe it as you want it to be believed.  Do you genuinely believe that your revenge on the institution you perceived not to stand by your belief deserved what you have been doing? you judge on your own perception and not on what is truly correct and reasonable.  your reasoning were twisted and maybe 90% of the world stand by your cause but also 90% of the world would not agree with your actions.  Even the western media deliberately concealed and hid the riot footages and focus on the scenes where the police were apprehending the rioters because they believe that you would lost the sympathy amd support if those clips were shown.
Comment 203.2	@9871ification <br />For 99% of poor Tibetians who have live under serfdom and the oppression of superstitous belief rather than modern science and technology, it is for Tibetians themselves to decide whether a society build upon modern economic principles is better or one based on ancient religion of a spiritual leader reincarnate.<br /><br /><br />If you think the occupation of Tibet and Xinjiang is akin to the Japanese occupation of Asia based on carnage, rape and pilferage, then you are mistaken. China has plans to turn this states into economic success and not to diminish the states into perpetual servitude states  i.e. &quot;Polands&quot; during Soviet era.<br /><br /><br />That&#39;s why there are education camps which are actually training institutes to equip poor farmers with skills that are required in nation building. Farmers no longer have to live according to the weather patterns dictated by the &quot;gods&quot; but have a stable income afforded by modern living. <br /><br /><br />With large scale mechanisation of the farms, labour is freed up to other sectors of the economy. And unemployed monks and religious students can be deployed to do productive work that alleviate poverty. Instead of praying for a miracle.
Comment 203.3	@Kelvin Lim you accept how cruel the world doesnt mean others hv to as well, and we hongkongers have prepared to sacrifice  for a better world
Comment 203.4	@Kelvin Lim lol, &#39;does it really matter&#39;, hope you can still say the same when the statue of ur belief get blown by bomb in front of you, and watching ur ppl get raped and if you express ur anger, you get killed
Comment 203.5	@9871ification The Dalai Lama called it invasion. The Chinese call it liberation and unification. Does it reallly matter?<br />Bottom line is are Tibetians better off serving a feudalistic council of men who claimed spirituality or do Tibetians want to participate in the economic wealth that China can bring to the inner landlock plateaus of Tibet?<br />The Chinese has to deliver better standards of living to the Tibetians otherwise they will lose the war on ideology. If it just for exploitation of resources, the Chinese elite will have learned nothing from the exploitation of Africa by white colonist.

Comment229	all that effort and injury just to rescind an unpopular bill.<br /><br /><br />If only they had democracy.
Comment 229.1	@momo lolo You still haven&#39;t understand my argument, this is my third time repeating it. It is not about whether the system is democratic or not, is whether the leader of the country wants to solve it or not. <br /><br /><br />Referring to the point about a leadership, I&#39;ve never said we shouldn&#39;t have a system. <br /><br /><br />Another point that you have argued is about India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. BBC, Channel 4, Sky news do recognise them as &#39;democratic&#39; countries so I will stick to that. These countries have bad governance rather the system itself which is my point at the end. As you have said that they are trying to getting rid of oppositions, this means that the government is not focusing on what the citizen wants, it was trying to get rid of the opposition! One of the good example of a country that has barely functioning opposition (base on the democratic index publish by the west) but a good governance is Singapore. Despite they have gerrymandering and a bad treatment towards opposition and the media, the government has proven they are the trustee for the people, the last government corruption case that has came up seems to be in the 1980s from what I know of.<br /><br /><br />Regarding to your suggestions on having a &#39;true&#39; election and allowing the opposition from the Legco win. A clear example would be Taiwan and the most recent Malaysia. After Taiwan has allow free elections in the 1990s with the pressure of the US government, all I have experience was basically 1) the existing government getting rid of pervious government policies, and vice versa after each 5 years term limit 2)The two parties are attempting to eradicate each other. At the end who benefits, I don&#39;t believe much of the citizens benefit. These parties are only making policies for short term and attempting to fulfill the needs of a small group of population rather while sacrificing the countries long term development. At the end it is still back to my point, it is whether the leader of the country wants to solve a place problem or not. <br /><br /><br />Again about the &#39;stepping down&#39; of leaders of Asian countries that you have commented on. It is &#39;mandatory&#39; because it is the culture a western democracy in general, where it is required to step down when doing something wrong. That is why culture exist, even in politics, because every country is different. Until now you still haven&#39;t proven to me on any Asian PM who have step down because of the protest make by the people (not in the case of western power&#39;s pressure, not because of losing support from the army and cabinet)!<br /><br /><br />The last comment about Fake news was pretty hilarious. Firstly, what do you mean by Fake news? Does a news that doesn&#39;t align with your news means fake news? I do not know any of a leader in an asian democratic country that is willing to step down because of peoples protest (rather than because of the pressure of the west, rather than because of the lost of support in the military and the cabinet), that is why I want you to point out. If I am certainly brainwash then I support be align with a particular agenda, but I have kept on saying that I would not want to defend China on a number of political issues as I personally didn&#39;t really much about that area. <br /><br /><br />At the end, back to this topic, democracy doesn&#39;t solve Hong Kong&#39;s current issue, as a person who has live in Hong Kong for some time (and I am sure you haven&#39;t) there are so many underlying factors such as housing problem, unforeseeable future for the teens, identity crisis, high cost of living, too much mainland Chinese crossing the border thus affect many Hong Kong people&#39;s live. These issues are require to solve by the Chief executive of Hong Kong. I am emotionally connected to Hong Kong, because it has been a place where I started my first career, and it is sad on how the protester are destroying their city and how the government has not enough power to solve the fundamentals of Hong Kong issue. That is what i mean about why democracy is not a solution to this scenario, as good governance and the governments motivation is lacking.<br /><br /><br />*I have know nothing much about Mao, so I can&#39;t comment much on it.<br /><br /><br />**Can you point out that a leader in &#39;democratic&#39; country in Asia would is willing to step down because of peoples protest (rather than because of the pressure of the west, rather than because of the lost of support in the military and the cabinet). As I do not find your arguments persuasive!<br /><br /><br />***Its boring and unconstructive to call someone who disagree with your idea, fake news.
Comment 229.2	@YoshiPeach Mario Boris isn&#39;t elected by the people, its a sign of a failure in democracy.
Comment 229.3	@A Guy <br />About the &quot;stepping down&quot; of leaders in Asian countries, its not really a culture, its mandatory step for a country to not to be wrecked by unecessary protests, riots and rebellions. The &quot;culture of stepping down&quot; is a hoax by created by dictators who didn&#39;t want to step down peacefully.<br /><br />Even if the leader isn&#39;t willing to step down, the cabinet will force him/her to, refusing to cooperate with the unworthy leader. If the leader decides to cause a bigger trouble in order to secure his position, like the Cultural Revolution drama, he&#39;s taking a bigger risk for himself and the country. If he decides to go further, he will bribe the military to cooperate with him, that will certainly cause a civil war, and a greater risk for the unworthy leader himself, not to mention the damage he caused when he&#39;s fighting the cabinet. There is way lesser reason for a capable leader to not to step down in a democratic country.<br /><br />There are many democratic countries in Asia who has leaders willing to step down, I live in one of them as well. It just fake news has greatly influenced your mind and your spirit.
Comment 229.4	@A Guy <br />1.The leader is part of the system as well, a leader without a system might as well as a nobody. For example, a chieftain of a primitive tribe is just another nobody, if there isn&#39;t any kind Hierachy system in the tribe at all. A leader must rely on his/her subordinates in order to rule effectively, therefore in the end of the day, no matter how heroic the leaders are, they have to rely on the system in order to rule properly. <br /><br />Without allowing any kind of opposition in a party/ parliament, leaderships tend to be corrupt fast since its much easier to secure one&#39;s position without much effort and negative consequences. For example, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have a rather low efficiency in terms of democracy, its due to the fact that their ruling party has a habit of physically crushing other parties from participating the general election. Their aim is to destroy the democratic system, then establish a fake democracy where there is only one ruling party, like CCP. Democracy has failed in these places, due to massive corruption within the leadership.<br /><br />Overtime, due to over-centralization of power, the government will got less inclined to rule properly, since the risks of not ruling properly are at the lowest when there&#39;s no criticism from the oppositions at all. If this keeps going on without any reforms or true general elections or politicians stepping down, sooner or later the people will soon rebel and attempt overrun the government by force, further wrecking the country. Most of the time, the military will take this as an advantage to &quot;fight for the people&quot; since they have all the equipments to rebel, like how Qing dynasty has fallen.<br /><br />Regarding the Legco, that is how every congress and parliament in the world works, whether its democratic or authoritian regime. Either ruling/opposition, factions/parties will attempt to obstruct certain bills that will certainly benefit the people. To counter those disadvantages, its very simple, they have to held a true general election. Let the troublemaking party win the election, let them in charge of many controversial bills, broken their fancy promises, lost their voters&#39; trust then badabing badaboom! More true voters for the previous ruling party! The end result is, the people will get more matured in voting and political matters, and the ruling/opposition party wouldn&#39;t dare to screw around so much anyone.<br /><br />Without carrying out any true general elections, its a karma that the troublemaking party has become the embodiment of every flaws that the ruling party has done, things will get out of control. Protests, riots and even rebellions will occur, like the Cultural Revolution during Mao&#39;s era, it happened because Mao isn&#39;t willing to step down or held a general election, so he attempted to crush his oppositions with force, by establishing the red guards.

Comment239	Universal suffrage in Hong Kong is also being provided in the Basic Law. The method for selecting the Chief Executive shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. The terms cannot be renegotiated in the middle of a contract using violence without consequence. Obviously, the current environment does not fulfill such prerequisite. And thanks to this unrest, there is probably very little hope for that to ever occur.
Comment 239.1	The rioters by their actions only proved that a sector of Hong Kong society does not support &quot;one country&quot; in the so-called &quot;one country, two systems&quot;. If so, it is clearly not the condition for universal suffrage.<br /><br />Even in US, individual states cannot secede from the union. Some folks had tried. It is called treason and cause of civil war.

United States will try to use political pressure to destabilize independent countries with independent foreign policies, and if that doesn&#39;t work it will use tariffs and sanctions, if that doesn&#39;t work the Empire will use ngos if that doesn&#39;t work the fascists will use the UN, if that doesn&#39;t work the murder machine will move to shipping arms to opponents of any country that has an independent foreign policy to create internal insurrection, and if that doesn&#39;t work, the United States military industrial complex will try to create a coalition to militarily change the leadership of the country, and if it doesn&#39;t work, then the endless Wars industry will go in unilaterally with its military. Standard operating procedure. United States has already declared war on China, and it is in the beginning stages of softening up China for the preparation of a hot War to come. Congress is no longer used to declare Wars, War has already been declared through US actions.

Comment 253.2	@Kyuhun Kim god bless spainishs&#39;  protest success
Comment 253.3	@Jesse Chan the vast disparty in income is not offset by the difference in cost of living, as you imply. I can fetch the numbers for that if you like, but I think you understand that I have a fair grasp of the statistics regarding this situation, so I won&#39;t unless you fell it necessary.<br /><br />You can&#39;t talk to an international audience(which a YouTube comment section is) about how the CCP has &quot;lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty&quot; without the claim being heavilly misunderstood to be much more than it actually is. The claim itself is obfuscatory by nature.<br /><br />So, when defending the Chinese government against accusations of authoritarian abuse made by members of the international community, you can&#39;t simultaneously use a metric such as &quot;poverty&quot;, and also say that international interpretations of such a metric are unimportant.<br /><br />This is an example of the duel definition fallacy. You can&#39;t use China&#39;s definition of poverty to get the statistic and then present the statistic to western nations as an example of how China is performing in comparison to those nations.<br /><br />You say that China doesn&#39;t want to be the west, but they DO want to compare themeselves to the west in ways that make their system appear to be succeeding more, and by the same metrics.
Comment 253.4	Matt Doak Thank you for your in-depth response. However the only point I see that you are trying to make is a comparison between US and China. As you stated “western standards”. But you see China is not the west and they are not trying to be. Nor do they try to push their ways and methods on the west. The numbers you stated may be true and a beggar on the street could possibly make more than the average Chinese worker but the cost of living is also much lower in China. So I don’t see how your comparison is even relevant.<br />In my opinion, the world would be a better place if countries like the US just minded their own business instead of stick their heads into other countries domestic issues.
Comment 253.5	"@Jesse Chan &quot;lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty&quot;... Ah, the CCP&#39;s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%231talking"">#1talking</a> point.<br /><br />First, China&#39;s average income is BELOW the US poverty line. This means that hundreds of millions of chinese are CURRENTLY in poverty. In fact, street beggars in the US, on average, make more than Chinese workers. The poverty line as layed out by the CCP is akin to what the US calls &quot;extreme poverty&quot;, or less than 2 dollars a day.<br /><br />Next, you have to understand why 80 some percent of the most populous nation on earth were destitute. The four pests, the purges, government seizure of businesses, and so on. <br /><br />Millions of people who were forced into destitution by the ineffectual centralized schemes of the CCP were &quot;lifted out of poverty&quot;, meaning the system adopted enough free maret ideals to start making some money again, enough to pay the workers more than $2 a day, but not enough to pay them much more than that. Certainly not enough to lift them out of poverty by western standards."

Comment 256.3	Brexit should happen haha
Comment257	These people paid no taxes, smashed everything their father generation had build and claimed that they love HK.......
Comment 257.1	@Ike Turner lol<br />made me speechless
Comment 257.2	@Lau Z My country is the best country for me to live in. It is a good country to live in, but no country is perfect, and neither is China. I have lived 52 years in this country, if I was young, I could live in China or another country. I do not decide the fate of China, that is for others to decide. I do not know how long the Party will rule China, maybe 15 more years, before the middle class wants to rule the country, what the hell do I know!!! ADDIO!!!!
Comment 257.3	@Ike Turner No Beijing can&#39;t wait. They are already making HK into one country 1.5 systems
Comment 257.4	@Ike Turner Yep I am from Hong Kong. And Hong Kong is Hong Kong, unless China puts its dirty hands in it. For 150 years our bloodline has been separated, and for that long generations of people become different, and that is why Hong Kongers aren&#39;t Chinese.
Comment 257.5	@Ike Turner And at least Trump could only be president for at most 8 years but Xi is gonna do emperor for life. Imagine Trump being president for life. That&#39;s how I&#39;d feel about Xi
Comment258	Vox Populi 🇭🇰👊
Comment259	The extradition bill would have also enabled Beijing to extradite CIA and MI6 agents otherwise operating freely on Hong Kong soil. That&#39;s why the US &amp; UK media  have been vociferously against the extradition bill.

Comment 263.2	@Arab aur Chin valdin mujhe paise chaahye Most of the anti Hong Kong commenters are paid by China so its just simple to group them all to be paid lol

Comment 265.1	Lol the brits have no balls
Comment 265.2	You do realize that BBC is sort of against Brexit and it is improtant to note that BBC reporter are mostly except some are conservative.
Comment266	Being as a Hongkong person, I am so glad that my government finally listens to what the public has long demanded for.
Comment 266.1	Too little, too late.Had Curry lamb withdrawn the contentious bill in June 2019, the unrest would have been diffused. When a leader makes a blunder, the society suffers. She is still at the helm. Better resign.
Comment267	Keep fighting Hongkongers!
Comment 267.1	very interesting - 40 upvotes for 1 day. This means that there are HK supporting bots which upvote each others.

Comment 268.1	呵呵，香港已經解放了就在1998年香港回歸了中國🇨🇳
Comment269	Why did it take long to be scrapped? Kudos they are fighting for their freedom.
Comment 269.1	@Victor P. China is showing the world how democracy in HK works which the pan democratic parties are fanning by lies, intimidation and violence.
Comment 269.2	China does not want to give in
Comment 269.3	"This kind of peaceful protest BBC never shows cos it will mess up their report.<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/nBet0Akqoiw"">https://youtu.be/nBet0Akqoiw</a>"
Comment 269.4	YoshiPeach Mario It has a democratic parliament.

Comment 271.3	Lau Z 搞半天你就是香港废青本青还以为你是吃瓜群众所以还和你解释下，非常好！香港就是你的国家，快去成立临时政府还有军队，加油哦！关了冷气别跑就成
Comment 271.4	Lau Z well all the public stuff is apart of communism you know that right ?
Comment 271.5	Michel LU so funny indeed, Im a foreigner in China and I took HSR always.  For those dillusional Hong Kong youth, everything about  China is negative, I think its their education that was designed by anti-china ideologist
Comment272	Get rid of communism its the only solution, your choice XI JINPING you have already made a fool of yourself dont make it worse.
Comment273	Spain also need your continuous care
Comment 273.1	Dušan Xmetov lmao,nice imagination
Comment 273.2	BBC don’t have the guts to report Spain,they’re afraid of similar protests will happen in Scotland or north Ireland
Comment 273.3	Dušan Xmetov says by a guy who never has been China hahhahahahaha hello Chinese expert
Comment 273.4	@Trollololol Spain - representative democracy.  People&#39;s Republic of China - single-party authoritarian regime.  Now, I&#39;m not saying that Spain is perfect, far from it, but the citizens of China have it far worse when it comes to living conditions (very selective law enforcement (leading to arrests for petty crimes, and wide-spread lawlessness), no food safety guarrantees (that time children were dying from adulterated milk powder comes to mind), very little environmental and health protection (leading to insane amounts of smog that make it literally difficult to breathe), and phrases like &quot;change the law&quot; being even outright outlawed.)
Comment 273.5	Nah, spain isnt china. Media channels  only support pro-independence movements in HK but not in Spain. Their rationale is that China is evil but Spain is not. Typical double standards.
Comment274	"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23HEARJIMMYDORE"">#HEARJIMMYDORE</a>"
Comment275	Will this end the protests? It also shows the people when united can make changes
Comment 275.1	@Soviet Spud You make a lot of sense.
Comment 275.2	@23143 4803 Now I&#39;m wondering how long this will go on for
Comment 275.3	@SirPanic12 Tbh, the PLA are only talented at folding bedsheets lol. They haven&#39;t even experienced a legit warfare for 60 years I believe?
Comment 275.4	@SirPanic12 Protesters have been begging for that for ages. But seems like they&#39;ve given up to after deleting the propaganda videos a day later.
