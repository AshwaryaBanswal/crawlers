Comment1	Alison Hammond could have a potentially glittering career in sumo wrestling.
Comment2	From a Japanese perspective, women should make another organization. I support it. Anyway, I strongly criticize this BBC&#39;s biased report.
Comment3	Don&#39;t let the women in I only watch sumo to see t*ts
Comment4	This is news while the OPCW is shown to have distorted a report that led to the US, UK and others targetting Syria. While evidence of the Royals suppressing Epstien reports potentialy leading to continued abuse comes out and is not reported...<br /><br />Strange what the BBC considers worthy of their Youtube news reports!
Comment5	What not reporting on Anna  sourbrys court appearance BBC , I&#39;d have thought her lies would have attracted you like flies to shit ..
Comment6	Why do we never hear about men&#39;s netball?
Comment7	There are a lot of fat women in the UK, this may catch on.
Comment8	It&#39;s always political &quot;🍓!.

Comment 10.1	Hah, the BBC dont give a damn about native britons. They&#39;ll make 17 more videos on grenfell (and how it was caused by racist ass wyte pepol) before they talk about weather issues wreaking havoc.
Comment11	Lingerie Sumo will be popular!
Comment12	There is still gender discrimination in Sumo Association.
Comment 12.1	そういうふうに型にはまったジェンダー問題に置き換えるのが頭が悪い
Comment13	If women can&#39;t be pros why even allow them to be sumo at all.<br />Also does this even matter I mean even American sports women have it hard.
Comment 13.1	The difference, physically/mentally, between men and women is large. It&#39;s why women will never be able to &#39;compete&#39; with men, apart from using the sexual market and demanding laws that give themselves a protected status.
Comment14	progressive derangement syndrome
Comment15	Is there actually demand for Women&#39;s Sumo as a sport? Sumo itself is barely watched.
Comment 15.1	No, there isnt a demand. It&#39;s another &quot;&quot;&quot;issue&quot;&quot;&quot; that the left are going to push as incredibly destructive and sexist.
Comment16	Japan will be 50% non-japanese in 30yrs.
Comment17	To be strong, a women does not need to behave as a man.
Comment18	In fact, sumo is not so popular in Japan. That&#39;s the reason why there are few female wrestlers. Even for male wrestlers, we do not have so many dojos. <br /><br />Getting that weight is crazy and unhealthy.<br />Sumo, in Japan, is for old people who are watching NHK all day or specific internet people watching niconico.
Comment 18.1	Hey, stop stating facts!! That&#39;s sexist! dox this guy, ban him!!

Comment20	This is not a healthy thing for a man or woman.
