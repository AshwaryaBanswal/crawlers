Comment8	This is usually the result of big government spending too much, causing prices to go up, &amp; everytime i hear the word ‘equality’,  i smell just another communist-socialist plot, coz ‘grass hoppers &amp; ants’ cannot be equal..
Comment9	Do not be fooled by how the western media reports what’s happening in my country! Inequality, cost lot living, state repression, human rights violations etc! Millions of Chilenos take to the streets everyday protesting these reasons. We are protesting against Capitalism that has crippled my nation! The Neoliberal polices by the U.S backed right wing government is a joke! People are being tortured and killed by the military. They don&#39;t show it in the news here. The fascist government dont scare us anymore! We will not return to the times if dictatorship. El pueblo unido jamas sera vencido!
Comment10	IT IS AN ORGANIZED ATTACK BY NICOLAS MADURO AND OTHERS ! NOWBODY CAN SEE THIS?

Comment14	You are just like chilean national channels... you show only one side of the protests. What about the army (cops  and militaries) shooting and killing people?<br /> Every day The National Institute of Human Rights shows the amount of people hurt by the police forces. <br />More than 100 people were injured un their eyes!! And many of those will lose their sight. <br />The Government is killing  us!! On the street and with our economical issues. <br /><br />My biggest fear is NOT dying  but retire and receive just leftovers.
Comment15	I&#39;m from Chile, hopefully this all is going more pacific than the first week
Comment16	A BIG SALUTE TO PEOPLE OF CHILE. LET THE PEOPLE OF NEPAL GET THE INSPIRATION TO REVOLT AGAINST THE RULERS WHO IS SUCKING US LIKE LEECHES, GIVING AS PAIN AND MISERY!!!!!
Comment17	This is the left in Chile trying to get into the power by chaos and unrest forcing the goberment to resing.<br />Is the only way for them to get into the power. <br />They are destrying the economy, pushing the country into a colapse.<br />They have be in goberment the last 25 years, so if there is someone to blame for the actual problems are they.<br />The economical model works but they have been destroying it bit by bit, and then claim that capitalism does not work. <br />People dont want them, last election they loose bad, and the next election they have no chance, so before we get there they want to turn down the actual goberment.<br />Normal chilean people dont destroy their cities.<br />Normal chilean people want to work and restore the economy.<br />This are the school kids and university students brainwashed by marxist teachers, hooligans from sooccer teams and guerrilla guys infiltrated into the country from Venezuela by the left.<br />And of course the media leftist, supporting all the bullshit.
Comment 17.1	@El Duque Santiago es tan triste y sesgada tu mirada de la vida en Chile que no vale la pena responder a cada uno de tus comentarios.
Comment 17.2	@Amesthys Si claro, dejaron la educación pública en manos de la izquierda con profesores marxistas.<br />Ellos educaron a los guerrilleros que ahora destruyen nuestra ciudad.<br />En vez de enseñarles oficios reales, ciencias exactas, cosas útiles, se han dedicado a llenarles la cabeza con ideología de izquierda; que la lucha de clases, que el día del joven combatiente, que masturbarse es bueno, que la libertad sexual, que existen mil géneros, que los pueblos originarios, pfff.<br />Ahora tenemos puros vagos revolucionarios que no saben hacer nada, frustrados y que quieren demoler el modelo que les dá de comer.<br />Desque que comenzó &quot;La revolución de los pingüinos&quot;, ¿mejoró la educación? <br />Nope, cero, nada. <br />Un claro ejemplo: hicieron mierda el Instituto Nacional.
Comment 17.3	@Amesthys Hemos tenido dos gobiernos de derecha, los dos de Piñera, el primero fue muy bueno, pregúntale a cualquier persona de trabajo cómo le fué en el primer gobierno de Piñera. Todos concuerdan en que la economía iba creciendo y había trabajo, es mi experiencia personal y de la gente que conozco y no soy un gran empresario que vive en el barrio alto. Bachelet lanzó una bomba a la economía con su cagá de reforma, además de traer más de 1.5 millones de inmigrantes que acentuaron el cagazo bajando los sueldo y aumentando el desempleo. Si, fué una mierda vivir en dictadura, pero los milicos ordenaron el país y la economía, a la Concertación le entregaron un país andando. Si tu crees que la izquierda es la solución a los problemas, o te falta perspectiva o te lavaron la cabeza. Si tú crees que cambiando la constitución y haciendo cabildos, asambleas ciudadanas va a haber un país más justo....ese es el camino a Chilezuela.
Comment 17.4	Y que triste tu comentario sobre las escuelas y universidades. <br />Como profesora, soy testigo vivencial del esfuerzo que todos hacemos para que los estudiantes comprendan lonque esta sucediendo en el país sin tintes políticos... porque muy orgullosamente te te digo: ESTE MOVIMIENTO SOCIAL NO ESTA ABANDERADO POR NINGUN PARTIDO POLÍTICO   y tampoco lo vamos a permitir. <br />El movimiento  solo nos  pertenece a nosotros, al pueblo oprimido por un Estado indolente e indigno.
Comment 17.5	What the fuck? If you want to talk, at least tell the truth. <br />Chile no ha sido gobernado estos últimos 25 años por la izquierda... tenemos a Piñera tristemente sentado en el poder por segunda vez. <br />El sistema que tenemos NO sirve, no porque la izquierda lo haya destruido, sino porque sus cimientos están hechos en un periodo el cual no coincide en lo que Chile está viviendo hoy. Una constitución hecha en dictadura por y para las empresas extranjeras, no para el pueblo. <br />La privatización trajo consigo pobreza en la microeconomía. <br />Claro! Chile creció económicamente comparado con los años 70&#39;s pero es a nivel macro.<br /> Lo que pensamos que era una economía cuyas ganancias caería como cascada, no fue así  y hoy tenemos al 90% de la población tratando de sobrevivir al costo de vida que no es rentable porque nuestros sueldos son un muy mal chiste.
Comment18	"Comparing this very loose approach to the conflict one week ago and how the BBC now is strikingly keen on explaining the roots of the social unrest like never before (<a href=""https://youtu.be/chiWVxreqhU"">https://youtu.be/chiWVxreqhU</a> ) makes you wonder what does citizens must do to get their demands heard... its about righteousness, persistance or simply fear of violence?"
Comment19	SEBASTIAN PIÑERA IS A TRAITOR OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OF CHILE 🇨🇱 SEBASTIÁN PIÑERA IS A WAR CRIMINAL SENTENCE HIM TO DEATH PENALTY 💀☠️ EXECUTION BY FIRING SQUAD HE ORDERED INNOCENT PEOPLE TO GET MURDER THAT A HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS
Comment20	Is it true that 2% of the people are  in control of 50% of national economy ? If this is partially true then the they have  100% right to protest against their government. This is  a demonstration against inequility, mass privatization and fake democracy. How should they be called enimy of the country by a democratic government?
Comment21	I don
Comment22	Is not for the metro is for 30 years of injustice
Comment23	Chile has a lot of money but the administration of it is totally unfair. A millionaire in Chile lives better than a millionaire in Sweden and parliamentarians have better salaries than all developed countries.<br />CHILE AWAKE!!
Comment24	I was expecting so much more from the BBC, but they barely cover the surface of the reality on my country. Shame.
Comment 24.1	I thought the same!! <br />But don&#39;t  worry, we know what trully happens in our country! <br />The people united,  will never be defeated ✊🏻
Comment25	Have seen so many videos, including one of soldiers harassing passers by, a child being kidnapped by police, countless of unprovoked attacks on members of the public, one where a witness sees officers dump a young woman’s raped and tortured body, many videos of ppl being beaten and of police and army burning down and looting, also of demonstrators unmasking civilian dressed officers who are deliberately creating havoc. It’s all available online, as is President Piñera declaring he will deploy officers to quell protestors stating that “we’re at war with a powerful enemy” that being the ppl of Chile. He deployed violent and repressive measures, which has led to the detention of more than 5,000 ppl, torture, abused and rape victims who have openly accused the police and military. The chief of medical practitioners has stated forensic evidence concludes that bodies found burnt were actually shot, and she is now being pressured to step down for the disclosure. There have been so many ppl shot in the eye at point blank range, meaning they’ll be forever blind in one eye....where is the coverage for all these ppl! Biased reporting, whitewashing all the atrocities all over the world.  as all the evidence is available. Shameless reporting
Comment 25.1	Oh, and let’s not forget that the REAL death toll stands at over 40 and counting
Comment26	Alaska Independent!  Be with us!
Comment27	People is desperate because in Chile there is an economic crisis, and they have no work (hence no money) and in Chile as the neoliberal paradise it is, if you have no money you don&#39;t have access to pretty much any human right namely education for your children, healthcare, housing, etc...the government is trying to apply the shock doctrine as in the 70s and the army is killing civilians. The wealth tough has already concentrated so much that there is not a middle class and the country is slowly becoming a dystopian look alike of Elysium.
Comment28	Disappointing and disgusting human beings at the BBC and all of the media (and trolls in comments below) who participate in this deception and therefore have blood on your hands. INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE DYING AT THE HANDS OF THESE TYRANTS. It is not the people of Chile who are the delinquents and vandals. There is plenty of video evidence of who is really behind the fires, looting, and violence. The Chilean people are being framed to justify repression and who knows what else.
Comment29	Ojo chilenos preferir la de rre porque la isquierr gobierna como el. Pi en todos lados donde gobierna la isquierr no tienen comida  se comen su prapia caca ojo
Comment30	Ache not, my hispanic brothers and sisters, soon, Chile, Venezuela and Catalonia will be freed!
Comment31	I am from Chile and have posted my views from Santiago on the crisis we are going through, with an analysis on why it happened and my take on the way forward. Just search on YouTube for &quot;The Chilean Crisis Why it Happened and the Way Forward&quot; if you are interested. It is just an impartial assessment, that does not favour any political views - actually the opposite, as it reflects a country with a clueless government, and a clueless parliament.
Comment32	This is an outstanding representative of Latin American democracies in the eyes of the United States.😂 Fight for freedom! Stand with Chile!!

Comment35	A lot has changed since the 21st. Please do an update for the world to hear. The subway&#39;s fee was just a trigger, there is plenty more going on.<br />There are reports of people getting tortured by police and military inside the subway&#39;s tunnels, arrests before curfew hours, missing people, rapes, civilians (including children as young as 10) getting shot. Today (25th of October) we just had the biggest pacific march this country has ever seen. It would be nice for the BBC to show this to the world.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: The march can be found by a simple search as &quot;marcha plaza italia&quot;. It is worth seeing.
Comment36	RESEARCH, THIS WAS CAUSED BY EVNEZUELA AND RUSSIA, STOP LYING
Comment37	Dear Chile - burn down all police stations and govt buildings - BURN EVERYTHING!!! - A QUEMAR TODO!!!<br />.<br />.<br />.
Comment 37.1	Jose Luis Miletich No, no incites al odio ahueonao
Comment38	Police are using tear gas and rubber bullets on citizens. Where is the outrage.  Hong Kong police use the same tear gas and rubber bullets.  BBC, a real example of double standards in reporting. The transit system looks like Hong Kong
Comment39	I am from chile, this is for years of Social inequality, We are fed up, we are furious
Comment40	Free Catalonia! Where is the justice? Where is free talking?  Where is the democracy? Please support them like support riots of HongKong!
Comment41	Fuck the police, slaves of N. W. O, banks and globalization. Animals. North America and Europe do nothing, but if someone wins in favor of the people, like Assad or Maduro, who are immediately attacked by fake democracies and ignorant globalists in favor of banks and uncontrolled immigration.
Comment42	“Stand with Chile, Fight for Freedom
Comment 42.1	@Skylarssy You didn&#39;t understand what he want to say lol
Comment 42.2	kevin kou lmao what freedom? Freedom of expression has a limit and people surpassed it, totally by insulting the police and military, beating them making them not to be able to do their job. I wish you could be here to see all the grocery stores they’re burning and looting, burning the subway stations perjudicial to all the people who use it everyday.
Comment43	I am chilean and I understand that people need better salaries, health and retirement. even myself. This is not Chile. We are a pacific and solidarity country that just wants peace and equality. Our country has   a good economy but the government needs to take care the people. This is not us, we wouldn&#39;t burn our own metro (subway), we wouldn&#39;t burn our own supermarkets, we wouldn&#39;t loot our own stores. We have one of the biggest criminal -  terrorist involved Maduro, Cuba and same chilean  communist  inside the government,  they being in contact with Maduro and his criminal organization.Chilean Communist went to the Forum in Sao Paulo-Venezuela to plan and destroy Chilean&#39;s  economy  THIST IS WHAT&quot;S HAPPENING IN CHILE. By the way not just Chile, also Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Argentine even Brasil and USA.. Same Maduro spoke in front of his people and admitted. Maduro wants to DESTABILIZE LATINOAMERICA...
Comment44	This is another Hong Kong style &quot;Pro-Democracy&quot; Millions protests,   police are using violence against peaceful protesters, what A beautiful sight to behold , stay strong ! Western media support you.
Comment 44.1	@Zegwei Teoh no false. chile had many communista presidents but they didnt protest. but when a center &quot;left&quot; president is elected they decide to protest. this is a communist protest. soon chile will be communist. i like to see if they protest againt a communist or socialist president. lol they will be stomped. lmao. i give chile only 5 years. chile will be like argentina or venezuela in less than 5 years.
Comment 44.2	@Bill Muno they are same, fight for freedom
Comment 44.3	no it is not. hong kong is protesting communist china. in chile the protesters are communist. not the same
Comment45	"talk about <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23chileviolateshumanrights"">#chileviolateshumanrights</a><br />talk about the soldier running over a guy with a vehicle and being reinstated to his position, talk about the military hitting homeless people for being outside during curfew, about the minister of the interior smiling while congresswomen showed him the numbers of people being detained and killed<br />talk about how many times the military and the police are standing by while letting other people rob and about the many videos making you wonder if they aren&#39;t causing at least part of the unrest (breaking a traffic light, seemingly lightling barricades and places on fire)<br />talk about people who were detained saying they were phisically and sexually abused, backed up by the INDH (national institute of human rights), about the ongoing investigation about a metro station being used as a torture center<br />i could keep on going but you get the point..."
Comment46	Free Lebanon!!!!
Comment47	The army have killed adults and children, have stole from super markets, have raped chileans, and are torturing the people in one of the metro stations! It&#39;s an absolute shame that these news report only talk about the army getting attacked by people with pot and pans while the army is the one shooting innocents on the street.<br />HOW ARE THEY NOT TALKING ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHT THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM THE CHILEAN PEOPLE !!!!
Comment 47.1	lol take your medication silly boy
Comment48	Is very sad how socialist and communist activist promote destruction and  chaos and acting like reals terrorists. They hate everybody and everything. They only using young people easy to convince. Even if the president give to them what they post to asking. They still keep going with violence and terrorism. That is a clare example they dont protest for need of something they doing it to promote terrorism and destroy democracy. Destroying something is good for themselves and was building with their own taxes money. Good the president invite externals observers to see what is the reality to show the true to the world. Very very sad.
Comment49	&quot;i believe in democracy&quot;<br /><br /><b>Turns his government into a dictatorial regime</b>
Comment 49.1	He decreed a State of Emergency and a curfew because there is vandalism and that can’t be happening. People is so intolerant here and they don’t even respect the police and military. It’s a shame. Also they’re not killing people, just injuring them because they are destroying the subway, making everything turn on fire and looting grocery stores. They don’t even use real ammo because police can’t hurt people because of “human rights” fuck all these anarchy groups, communists and socialist. CHILEZUELA is on the way.
Comment 49.2	People is desperate because in Chile there is an economic crisis, and they have no work (hence no money) and in Chile as the neoliberal paradise it is, if you have no money you don&#39;t have access to pretty much any human right namely education for your children, healthcare, housing, etc...the government is trying to apply the shock doctrine as in the 70s and the army is killing civilians.

Comment 53.1	Yes and you&#39;re right
Comment54	Most of those protesters Are Immigrants, They&#39;re DESTROYING OUR BEAUTIFUL CHILE, just a few Chileans are involved

Comment70	Capitalism is going to the end. The polarization between the rich and the poor is the cancer of a free society. The government cannot restrain the greed of big capitalists and consortiums. Communism is the future.
Comment 70.1	No ! Communism is Past luckely
Comment71	خاصهم المنجل
Comment72	Thus the commie agitators ensure the metro prices go up.
Comment 72.1	FrankEdavidson They do earn it. In our system the capitalists steal the surplus value created by their workers. The poorer people also pay systematically higher interest payments. The rich lend the money out, but the poorer classes pay it back with higher interest. Free money for the rich. And if the rich fail the state always comes to bail them out. Btw, do you have any idea about the heavy subsidies that go their way, procurement or bailouts? All free money from the state. You are completely brainwashed and not too smart.
Comment 72.2	@Joe Hoang why would it if they don&#39;t earn it? Other people&#39;s money &#39;going&#39; somewhere is a socialist concept
Comment 72.3	Not really. All the money never went to them anyway and almost everything in Chile is privatized. They already got them to offer them free tuition a few years back at uni from what I have heard.
Comment73	I hope the Chilean army will K1II all the leftists in this country.
Comment 73.1	I am with you those people are terrorist
Comment74	be water, protestors!! learn from Hongkong. lol. Western media won&#39;t support you like Hongkong. In western media eyes, you are riotors. But hongkong protestors are hero of freedom. lol

Comment 76.1	are you another terrorist?
Comment77	The Problem is Economy getting worst, just see more country will follows, not just Chile.
Comment78	police and the army are shooting at masses of people, aiming to the chest, i was in the bus stop and a cop shoot at us, just because there was a group of people waiting for it
Comment79	Go and watch Guardian News instead, this video is just talking shit and hiding so much fact.
Comment80	If the metro was for the people Why the politicians never used it? If the metro was for the people why is it so expensive so most people can&#39;t even afford it ?
Comment 80.1	that why they have to destroy it. what mentality is that? only terrorist
Comment81	I wonder why BBC called the Hong Kong Protest as &quot;Protest Pro Democracy&quot;, but they criminalized the Chile Protest. Just wondering? Any thoughts?
Comment 81.1	"​@Karen Stuar <br />OMG!!! You American are so basic. The people who make all the caos, are police officers who work for Piñera. If you don&#39;t know nothing, just keep silence. You just believe what American TV, make you believe."
Comment 81.2	Sweet hard awake this are socialist terrorist they are criminals destroying everything is good for every chilean. You dont get it jet? wait to see you future after it.
Comment82	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8acIrtYbb-c&amp;t=0m35s"">0:35</a> This is downright laughable. Democracy? If democracy was functioning there would be no protests and the president wouldn&#39;t hold a city&#39;s worth of wealth in his own pockets. Military force does not maintain a democracy, it maintains a dictatorship and system of corruption."
Comment 82.1	@Skylarssy Let me be clear, I&#39;m not defending the measure of violence used by some of the protesters. But I am saying that if democracy had been preserved, these riots wouldn&#39;t have been happening in the first place. People don&#39;t tend to riot if the people&#39;s will is the rule (obviously smaller riots can still occur in a functional democracy, but large scale riots like these are the result of a lack of democracy). Without democracy and with restricted freedom to criticise, the only option people have left to achieve it is, sadly, riots. The looting is unnecessary and counter productive, but it&#39;s what gets the stories in the news and puts pressure on the government.<br /><br />On the bit about cops, I am by no means supportive of ACAB or similar organisations, as a matter of fact I&#39;m usually opposed to those. But in this case the police AND military are being used to uphold a dictatorial regime. It is an insult against the people, and the enforcers are equally violent (if not more so, since they are better equipped and have the court on their side) towards the protesters.

Comment103	According to UN 2018 data, the chilean HDI human development index (personal income, education and longevity) is ranked number one in all of latin america (mexico, central america, south america), ranking 43 in the world, ahead of argentina (46), uruguay (54), costa rica (62) and way ahead of all the other countries in latin america. It&#39;s hard to understand why they are protesting with such violence for a small increase in transport prices which are probably paid for by their employers. It seems like people are being manipulated by false narratives. Shouldn&#39;t chileans be celebrating their impressive accomplishments?
Comment 103.1	spoken like a true gringo
Comment104	The protesters are not looting, all the citizens went out to protest peacefully, the violence is by vandals and approvers who use chaos to loot supermarkets and department stores, we get tired of living in a neoliberal country that Pinochet and Nixon left us
Comment 104.1	Dude there ARE protesters looting too. Mostly students that feel that if they put supermarkets on fire the government will listen to them.

Comment108	The Communist party led by Nicolas Maduro have infiltrated Chile and destroyed supermarkets, pharmacies, stores, gas stations. His Marxist doctrine is destroying South America. We need help.

Comment111	What a beautiful scenery! Just wondering why this time BBC not even mention this word for Chile&#39;s violent protests. It is unfair for both Hongkong and Chile!
Comment112	BBC is so hyperopic! Protest in Chile is riot, while the same behavior in Hong Kong is &quot;fight for freedom and democracy&quot;? You Western media are the most ugly media in the world!!! All we want is just a peaceful life!
Comment 112.1	Remember they have some deep hatred for China. Dunno why. It’s just a country.
Comment113	Tanks on the streets, confronting police! Refuse, resist!
Comment114	So you just show viejas culiás that are sad because that shitty metro has been destroyed but don&#39;t tell that the entire dignity of the chilean people is destroyed because of that dwarf that we have as a president and all the headless fucks that workship him. Ok
Comment115	This is not completely true, most of the metro stations were burned by carabineros. Also, there are many supermarkets which have been opened by the army. The government has failed in controlling the crisis by not listening the chilean population during many years
Comment 115.1	Source?<br />“Most were burned by carabineros”?<br />Those are flaites
Comment116	This is misleading information ! very irresponsible of you, The government has declared war against its people, the military are killing people in the streets, young, students; detained women are being abused and raped; media is focusing in damages of supermarkets or atm which there is a lot of evidence in social media that are being caused by the same police and military forces; so why not informing people better, no more lies, that is also the fight, Chileans are fed up for years with this nonsense, corruption and abuse from the lies of the corrupted government!

Comment 118.3	@Cata Lina huh? Liking it? Guess both the military and left is the same on all countries huh
Comment 118.4	I’m from Chile. I know what’s actually going on.
Comment 118.5	Vitmar Tobby scared? I doubt that. They’re killing, hurting and kidnapping people and the worst part is that they actually enjoy that. I don’t think that’s what being scared is.
Comment119	If you want to see the truth, watch the videos posted on a facebook page called &quot;Piensa Prensa&quot;... Police respression is brutal... This situation has cost 15 lives (that&#39;s an official number, I&#39;m sure the number of people killed is larger). Do not trust the international media. Chilean people are not only protesting against the metro ticket cost and the same is happening all over the country!...
Comment120	According to the National Institute for Human Rights of Chile (INDH), more than 1.400 people have been arrested, at least 84 civils have been gunshoted by the military and the police, but it&#39;s just what they have been able to gather. Its worse. People are being killed and tortured.
Comment 120.1	cherry chainsaw Agreed
Comment 120.2	@Cheese I know, but it is a fact that the allegations exist and that alone is horrible and udeniable. The <b>fact</b> there is allegations of such things is horrible.I&#39;ve seen the fake news and conspiracies and honestly that is a load of bullocks as well. But the reality remains: there are allegations of torture, there are different points of view recorded and documented of the same human rights violations that in many cases qualify as torture, the latest one being the police station&#39;s crucification, where 2 men and a minor were handcuffed, maced and beaten. It is one confirmed and fully proven, the rest still <b>allegations</b> that as allegations alone are disgusting, especially the subway one if proven true. To me this last one is the most condemming one considering the countless accounts and suggestions of it being true but sadly officials being seen <b>before</b> the investigation started cleaning the tunnels which is highly discouraging *if true*. <br />Whatever, i do agree, we can only wait and see. Not to mention <b>hope</b> these allegations and suspiscions are false for the sake of all the people involved, even though all points otherwise.
Comment 120.3	cherry chainsaw I agree it sounds awful but you can’t say it’s a <i>fact.</i> There’s lots of “fake news” (sigh) around because people spread unconfirmed stuff. I’m just saying, but there’s also people alleging this is all a Venezuela/Cuba conspiracy 🙄 but that <i>still</i> doesn’t mean it’s true just because they allege it. There are allegations of torture but like all other allegations they’re not facts till proven. We’ll just have to wait and see
Comment 120.4	@Cheese That is true, there is still an ongoing investigation but theres plenty of witnesses coming forward with the subway thing. If that&#39;s not convincing enough how about the people who got crucified on a police station? Is it not torture to detain people and crucify them? I&#39;m not saying there were only tortures, but the fact there is an investigation (in the subway&#39;s case) is bad enough, the fact there were people crucified is even worse. There shouldn&#39;t even be  people wondering if there were tortures or not much less actual evidence of torture. Proven or not... THE ALLEGATION IS THERE. And that is horrible, gross and despicable in every possible way. I insist, the subway allegations may not be proven <b>yet</b> but the crucification? The videos circulating globally of people being held illegally and beaten forno other reason other than violating curfew, an action sanctionable with fines as an offense not a crime and certainly not to be detained, tortured or even shot? All of that is still real and the fact, as i said before, that it&#39;s &quot;a thing&quot; is grotesque and irrefutably horrifying. Proven or not (in the subway&#39;s case). The fact of the allegations remain and by that fact alone we should be frightened, disturbed and enraged.
Comment 120.5	cherry chainsaw Okay but that’s not <i>torture.</i> The whole subway torture thing hasn’t been proven yet.
Comment121	THE IMAGES YOU SHOW DO NOT REPRESENT OUR MOVEMENT! PEOPLE ARE BEING SHOOT IN PACIFIC MANIFESTATIONS, PEOPLE ARE BEING KIDNAPPED BY THE MILITARY, AS YOU SAID, PEOPLE ARE DYING!!

Comment123	This report doesn’t even scratch the surface of what’s going on. Terrible bbc , shameful!
Comment 123.1	Yes I agree. BBC and other media news sites have no clue on what is really going on down there
Comment 123.2	People is desperate because in Chile there is an economic crisis, and they have no work (hence no money) and in Chile as the neoliberal paradise it is, if you have no money you don&#39;t have access to pretty much any human right namely education for your children, healthcare, housing, etc...the government is trying to apply the shock doctrine as in the 70s and the army is killing civilians. The wealth tough has already concentrated so much that there is not a middle class and the country is slowly becoming a dystopian look alike of Elysium.

Comment126	The news arent covering the full scale of the situation, my friend who lives there says that not only that it’s about the subway, but it’s a full on coup to overthrow the government by the socialists/communists. It’s no wonder why the media won’t cover it
Comment 126.1	The media doesnt show the military killing innocent people in cold blood either
Comment127	15 years ago Chile took in 24 yugoslavos <br />In less than one year 20 returned to destroyed Yugoslavia (the war) they prefer that to working for misery life in Chile !

IN CHILE THE MILITARY IS KILLING PEOPLE IN THE STREETS, and the government and the media created a campaign to make citizenship divide. Please, if any BBC journalist see this, CALL YOUR TEAM TO WORK RESPONSIBLY, IF YOU PUBLISH THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION YOU ARE NOT HELPING US, you are one of the most respected media in the world, people believe in you. We need the world to know the truth.<br /><br /><br />In this moment In Chile are people missing, dead and more than 2000 detainees  and on tv we only see lies, they say we are criminals. All our communication media are private, work for power and financed with advertising. They don&#39;t tell us the truth.<br /><br />Chilean citizens are not violent, we go out with pots, posters, water and lemons. The military and cops  go out with weapons, submachine guns, tear gas bombs, military tanks, cars that throw gas and water, helicopters, sticks and and use them against us. THEY OPPRESS US, THEY PERSECUTE US, THEY KILL US.<br />We are obliged to enter our houses at 7 pm for the curfew. During the night we listen shots and helicopters pass over our houses. Many people record from their windows the repression that their neighbors live in the streets and then publish it. In social networks we see murderers, baleated people  by military and cops. <br /><br />TO ALL PEOPLE WHO READ THIS MESSAGE: PLEASE CHECK ON TWITTER, THERE IS THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS REALLY GOING IN CHILE. OUR HUMAN RIGHTS ARE BEING VIOLATED HERE AND OUR PRESIDENT SEBASTÍAN PIÑERA EFUSES TO LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE <br /><br /><br />WE NEED YOUR HELP.<br /><br /><br /><br />A hug from Santiago de Chile and love to all the people of the world who live the repression of their government!!!!"

Please be more educated before making dump comments about Hong Kong or China, or even the Brit.
Comment 137.2	You are wrong, we are not fighting for freedom.<br />This is the left pushing the goberment to resing through riot and unrest.<br />The people dont want them because they want to turn the country in the same shit as Venezuela.<br />That is why they went so bad in the last elections.<br />People in Chile wants capitalism because its works, but they destroy the economy and then blame capitalism.<br />They are doing what ever it takes to push their agenda.

Comment155	soy de chile y muy cierto lo que se dice, todo partió por el alza del pasaje, que para personas de tercera edad que reciben una miseria de jubilación y para los jóvenes si es significativo la subida del pasaje y para otras personas también, pero esto es solo la  &quot;gota que sobrepaso el vaso de agua &quot;, porque  ya existía  una disconformidad por  la privatización del agua, por   los altos sueldos de los parlamentarios y  que no realizan leyes concretas a favor del país, por pensiones miserables de las AFP,  por sueldos mínimos que no logran abastecer un hogar, por  la carencia de insumos en los hospitales y consultorios, el robo de los políticos, etc. Por eso se sigue manifestando. <br />si es  cierto que Piñera reaccionó  imprudentemente, al militarizar el país, eso  provocó mas molestia de la gente, ya que muchos manifestantes, como yo,  hemos  marchado pacíficamente y nos han reprimido, sin embargo,   en donde hay saqueos o incendios,  los carabineros poco han  actuado, dichos saqueos  o actos violentos no son parte de  la gran mayoría chilena que  se manifiesta, son de gente con una historia vital de violencia que se aprovechan de esta situación, y tristemente  los medios de comunicación chilenos atribuyen estos incidentes a los manifestantes mayoritarios ( que no hacemos vandalismo). Se le esta pidiendo  al presidente un cambio en las leyes o la constitución  que permita medidas concretas y legisladas  para que mejoren los servicios de salud,  los sueldos mínimos,  para que baje la dieta parlamentaria, para que el agua no sea privada, etc, pero el presidente hace unas horas comunica de un plan de reconstrucción del daño público  ( que es necesario pero no lo urgente o lo que se demanda)  y  que se de pelea contra la violencia,  en vez de generar un plan con medidas concretas que otorgue lo que la gente esta demandando. lo imperante para la gente  que se esta manifestando no es la reconstrucción  o  apagar la violencia, es todo lo que mencione anteriormente, y  me sorprende que el presidente aún no lo entiende, o lo esta evadiendo o esta dando soluciones no pertinentes para este  momento que se vive en CHile.

We are one of the countries with the highest per capita income in Latin America but politicians have robbed us of everything (there are 2 sides: the left and the right, and between they are all relatives and / or partners of millionaire companies)<br /><br />The president says on TV that there is an enemy, but the enemy is him since he does nothing to ensure that the police and the military take care of us of the criminals who have taken advantage of looting and burning everything, they have even made assemblies!<br /><br />People are uploading all the tests to social networks, and in my city Concepcion have marched more than 30,000 people alone today.<br /><br />WE WANT FREE AND QUALITY EDUCATION<br /><br />FREE PUBLIC HEALTH AND QUALITY FOR ALL<br /><br />NO MORE ASSOCIATION OF PENSION FUNDS (REMOVAL FUNDS OF THE POPULATION ARE IN HANDS OF PRIVATE WHOSE OWNERS ARE CLOSE TO THE GOVERNMENT WHO MANAGE OUR MONEYS AND IF THEY WIN ONLY GIVE US A EXTREMELY PERIMENTLY MINIMUM WEEKLY )<br /><br />CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY AND THAT THE PRESIDENT WAIVES.<br /><br /><br /><br />Friends! We are a democratic people, we do not want anarchy, we want fair and loyal rulers to whom we work in this country every day to do what it is.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />There is money to finance all these requests: we are one of the main exporters of copper in the world and also soon they will begin to exploit lithium mines in central and southern Chile.<br /><br />please help us<br /><br /><br />please spread on RRSS!

Comment 163.2	the great middle class that they enunciate of Chile only exists because now all are in the limbo of a permanent debt the modern slavery typical of usury, the high taxes that do not really reach people, so much is seen goes to the military that at times like this are only to repress us, the natural resources sold by foreigners to the Chileans themselves, the performance of the country was never taken advantage of and the government of the day only blames the mob of the day. because the characters above this plot during all the governments after the dictatorship that it seems that never left because in reality those who rule are very powerful people and politicians only complices, distractions and shooting targets, those who really always sent are Malthussian philosophy that uses Machiavellian tactics are well known and yet unknown live outside the social bubble and in the place where the true middle and upper class lives they have the entire army in their neighborhoods where their irreverent salaries do not allow them to see reality from the situation they create television montages they tell the people that they are going to take things out and then the press leaves them as thieves to justify the massacre, the undercover police are hiding in the crowd to expel peace but perhaps beyond all this coming planned that is to say, a citizenship that expresses itself and does not get carried away by dissent is emerging controlled neither by the left nor prefabricated liberalisms. the people will always be free in their own ways beyond mental manipulation, perhaps that is why at first, they announced war, but now they apologize for the news, they will no longer be able to camouflage themselves with the people and until now they generate montages using the old shock doctrine, who He wants to continue with things as they are because he chose to live anesthetized in the alternative reality of ignorance and slave slavery in a rich country where the earth gives us everything, this is not only going to South America, this goes without borders, I do not call vandalism I call a conscious thought without political colors
Comment164	Who in the heck names a country after a whale&#39;s vagina?
Comment165	Chile is a free country, based on a free market economy system . The individual rights are respected and the state of law prevails all the time. Since the country adopted the ideas of Milton Friedman Chile experienced a transformation; poverty went from 50% down to 8%, &quot;generation inequality&quot; (standard of life from grand parents, parents and actual young people ) decreased substantially (in contradiction to the fake arguments always heard by the left wing *), the country became an open economy and made trades with the majority of the countries in the world. Chile has the chance to become a developed country only if can keep its democracy intact. Understand the complexity of the economy, the way the system of pensions works (individual capitalization) and other government instruments demands education, personal interest and will to understand. The majority of the population prefers to become a victim of the &quot;system&quot; and blame the government. People are blind by their beliefs and they protect their demands as a religious person protects its church. People in Chile has the right to manifest and express their demands in a pacific way, but there are groups that camouflage among them and then lit up the movements and the riots. As populism spreads, people do not use their rational cognition and common sense to judge the facts , instead they prefer to &quot;believe&quot; in fake and manipulated information. During these days, there´s a high probability that all the attacks to strategic facilities (more than 20 subways stations, water, energy and food chain supplies) were planned by organized groups that wanted to fissure democracy and order by seeding chaos using as a pretext the pacific manifestations. The principles of liberty and individual freedom will remain intact as long as people realized that those values have to be protected and encourage among the citizens, not forgotten, that´s when communism spreads and brings poverty and misery to the people.
Comment 165.1	@Marcelo Under capitalism it would be my choice where my money goes, not the governments&#39;s.
Comment 165.2	@Marcelo Like I said before. Singlepayer healthcare and public universities are communim not liberalism. You are trying to normalize communism.
Comment 165.3	@Marcelo Said the pro US imperialist.
Comment 165.4	@Daway Legit Chile had a liberal revolution in the 70´s and that saved us from the misery and poverty of our neighbors.
Comment 165.5	@Timothy Wei Comumnism in these days is trying to destabilized the country, but we are a solid democracy . I can recommend you some books and authors, ignorance and lack of common sense is everywhere  :&quot; Lol that´s your democracy...&quot;
Comment166	The Western media turned a blind eye and no one explicitly condemned the violence of the Chilean government supported by the United States. They only focused on HK and money.
Comment167	🎶&quot;I need a Pinochet&quot; 🎵
Comment168	BBC suck a Dick , you are just showing the destruction , but not why people are uprising on one of the most unfair economies in the world , where nothing is for the people , everything is for the corporations and the rich.
Comment169	Hi, Im in chile right now, let me tell you what&#39;s happens:  Over nothing (an automatic increase of 0.045 dollars of subway tickets made by the subway algorithms of oil price) all subway stations where attackde at the same time by guys with chemical weapons who manage to incinerate several of them, following this the president call the military because the police where overruled. The following day, at the same time too, all walmarts where attacked and sacked. At the same time the socialists and communists parties where inflaming the people to protest.<br /><br />Nobody believe it was spontaneous, here we believe it was am insurrection, a &quot;communist revolution&quot;, an intended coup of the moderate right government who is a weak guy.<br /><br />Beware because the guys who made this was basically Chilean Antifa.<br /><br />You are warned.
Comment 169.1	@serpentine1983 I don&#39;t defend the character of Piñera, the thing is that if you want to remove a president over a loud minority you are totalitarian, you need votes in a democracy.<br /><br />The poverty in Chile was 49% 40 years ago, the policies continued in democracy /because those guys aren&#39;t populists idiots and Berlin wall fell and crush leftists) and now is 8%, you know, in Argentina is 35%, so what is this point, Chile have it better than lots and lots of countries, the contempt is because you are comparing real world free market economy versus imaginary utopian other stuff that doesn&#39;t work but sounds good, that&#39;s called an populist policies, bread today, hunger tomorrow.<br /><br />Of course that nobody wants to struggle but Chile has it better than any country in the region thanks to free markets, maybe better than most of African countries to and in one day coordinated attacks on all subway stations doesn&#39;t happens there regularly, was more like an insurrection, possibly coordinated to destabilize the elected, by Vote, government.<br /><br />The thing is that what the left in the country wants are all populists measures and that makes more poverty.<br /><br />And the question about Neoliberalism, liberalism and capitalism was a trick question, to know if you know what are talking about... actually there is no &quot;Neo&quot;-liberalism my friend, there&#39;s no New or Old freedom, there only freedom.
Comment 169.2	@Felipe Herrera salinas you think that Piñera has worked more than the other guy? He even stole the &quot;transbank idea&quot; from his boss.<br /><br />The poverty line was scaled down in his first government and the data compiled by the INE were all tampered with. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Bachelette did the same. Also 50% of people earn less than US$500 a month, in a country so expensive it&#39;s impossible to meet ends by the end of the month without being in debt. That is poverty for me and the majority for what we can see , no matter what the INE and their tampered data tells us. For example, in Chile we pay around 50% more (depending on the exchange rate, right now is less than 50%, but the exchange is not normal at this point) for 1kW than in the USA, and the minimum wage is far less. Prices do not fit the reality.<br /><br />Explaining the difference between capitalism and neoliberalism is to complex to do it here, just capitalism it self was thought in 10 years and written in several books, even Jordan Peterson and Zizek argued for more than 2 hours and it wasn&#39;t enough (yes, they debated between capitalism and socialism). But I can attempt a very simplified one, risking being misinterpreted and somewhat wrong. In neoliberalism government lets the market regulate it self, allowing the companies to abuse at their will with almost no consequences, there is absolutely no protectionism to local industries.<br /><br />In capitalism, at least the government can interfere in the market and regulate to a certain extent what companies do and protect to a certain extent local industries. Also capitalism is more than that, is a way of handling your money/company, if you have one, and make it grow. We could say everyone is a capitalist.<br /><br />Even Trump, a capitalist, wants to protect the industries going into a commercial &quot;war&quot; with China, he even said NO to the TPP. Here they just don&#39;t care, several industries went to bankrupt after the FTA with China because there was no protection to local industries. That can be an example in the difference.<br /><br />(As a joke or irony ????) One can argue this protests as a way of self markey regulation were the people want to be paid fairly and treated fairly and as you can see, government does nothing because no interfering policy xD
Comment 169.3	@serpentine1983 Sorry but I cannot pass this many fallacies:<br /><br />I didn&#39;t say that you condone looting and burning, I clearly separated 2 minority groups, you and supposedly peaceful protestor, because I don&#39;t know you, buy I infer that you didn&#39;t make anyone late for work or something and the vandals protestors, first fallacy.<br /><br />Practically nobody likes the president, I think even his family didn&#39;t like it, but if you vote for the other guy who had socialist tendencies who had never worked a bit in human history we would loose all what had been gained in democracy in matter of economic growth, did you know that poverty 40 years ago was 49% and now is 8%? Did you know that forty years ago Venezuela had 40% of poverty and now has 80%, is an example that bad policies can destroy a country, not that you are defending that dictatorship.<br />People vote the presiden and in democracies you have to vote, and this president won with 55% of votes, in democracy you don&#39;t threw up the institution of the presidency because a laud minority get into the streets and some of them destroy stuff, that by force, that&#39;s totalitarian, did you like the chilean dictatorship? Because that what you want, that by force you can threw up democratic institutions.<br />Transantiago makes half of the Metro ticket, Transantiago was institutionalized in a Leftist government... and like leftists economic policies it fail.<br /><br />BTW did you actually know the difference between capitalism, liberalism and &quot;neoliberalism&quot;?<br />What&#39;s the difference?
Comment 169.4	@Felipe Herrera salinas pffft. Did I say that looting and burning is good?<br /><br />Where are the lies in my post? Why do you think that even people that voted for that crook are protesting? Why do you think all of Chile is protesting, the metro is only in Santiago and people outside of Santiago hates us because almost all of the money the country makes ends up in Santiago, do you really think they would protest in support just for the metro fare?<br /><br />If you voted for someone then it&#39;s also your right to ask for his resignation if they aren&#39;t doing their job, it&#39;s democracy, the best system we currently have and we must protect it at all cost until a better one is invented. And I&#39;m not a communist, this has nothing to do with political color. Communist can go to hell for all I care, they are worse than capitalism. But even worse than capitalism is neo-liberalism, and that is what we have here.
Comment 169.5	serpentine1983 no, that false, the Chilean people actually has it better than all other countries of South America with 8% poverty and better than large numbers of countries around the world and you don’t see other countries burning all public transportation and supermarkets.<br /><br />All of your arguments justifying the vandalism are regular leftist arguments, you have to go to vote for your president, not destroy the country if you don’t want a election result.<br /><br />You are a minority, the vandals who destroyed the country are a bigger minority than you. You are like the mob if you are using force to overturn an election who got crushingly lost.
Comment170	INFORMEN ACERCA DE LOS ASESINATOS, LOS MILITARES, PERROS DEL ESTADO, ESTÁN MATANDO AL PUEBLO CHILENO POR MANIFESTARSE CONTRA LA INJUSTICIA. BASTA. MILITARES EN LAS CALLES CHILENAS NUNCA MÁS, DICTADURA NUNCA MÁS. CHILE SE CANSÓ, CHILE DESPERTÓ.
Comment171	BBC is not Objective at all.
Comment172	People are being killed by the army and you only talk about The poor metro? Cops are getting inside houses and shooting, you are disgusting. We are crying for help, and you just talk like the news of chile, liars.<br />And the shit burned are being burn by the cops, ask me for a video if you want to now.
Comment173	Ppl are pissed!!!   throwing bread crumbs to the people and now  they are taxing those bread crumbs!!
Comment174	The so called democracy is at work, making Chileans suffer from this. The gap between the rich and the poor has been widened to a point where people could hardly bear it anymore.
Comment175	death the left and Nicolas Maduro
Comment176	Could you please also inform the reasons why we’re fighting for? There’s been over 30 years of abuse, corruption, low wages, miserable pensions, the cost of living is too high and people cannot pay for education and healthcare since it’s all private and too expensive, and then, the goddamned president goes ahead and says on national television that we’re an oasis in Latinamerica whole his ministers made awful declarations to defend the rise of the cost of life.
Comment 176.1	@Joe Hoang You think they keep it under the mattress? No it&#39;s in banks being lent out to enterprises to create wealth and growth for all. Wealth isn&#39;t a zero sum game. Communists and socialists are  just thieves.
Comment 176.2	The state isn&#39;t really responsible for individuals&#39; poverty unless they apply high taxes.
Comment 176.3	And why did it take you so long to wake up? Do you have any idea how much wealth the upper classes there have gained by now? You&#39;ll never get it back
Comment177	&quot;Democracy has the obligation to defend itself&quot; ??? Democracy is by the people who are currently being shot at your behest.
Comment178	Kudos to the dude literally chasing an armored van away with a sign!
Comment179	Who would have thought that Chile, the role model Country for LATAM , was actually as fragile as the rest of us? and that people were struggling with the same problems as the rest of LATAM... Inequality, lack of opportunities, a corrupt system that bleeds us all dry, expensive education, precarious heath care systems... Fuerza Chile! we are with you.
Comment 179.1	All of Chile did. It was a time bomb, we all knew it. But I think the &quot;government&quot; will just let time pass until most of the people gets tired and nothing will be achieved. I hope I&#39;m wrong and we will get our demands met.<br /><br />I told people of other countries what the real Chile is lime, few believed me or thought I was exaggerating, the governments have done a very good job in selling a false image of Chile to other countries.
Comment180	Chile after democracy
Comment181	HK STAND WITH CHILE.Yes,Free Chile!
Comment 181.1	ahm, Chile is already free and democratic. The rioters and looters thugs are the oppressors in this case.
Comment182	the chaos
Comment183	I&#39;m from Chile and the situation isn&#39;t like that! We, most people from Chile (not just the capital), are fighting for our rights. We are acting  with destructiveness because after so many years we haven&#39;t been heard (on the contrary, we have just been threaten, specially the teachers). People as shown in the video that helps to clean and reconstruct are the minority because they belive what the media here says, whish is a big lie. The true is that it all started as a passive protest but the police and military forces were very aggresive from the very beginning, the president was afraid because we are so many poeple, now that all movements are united. <br /><br /> There were a lot of robbery, burned supermarkets and such but were where the police and military forces? &#39;Fighting&#39; against passive protest (and I&#39;m telling the truth), even shooting. Belive it or not, there were many police/military officers cought making up scenes where they kill &#39;the bad people&#39;, which was quite the contrary -and that is what the official media shows. Last night was a hell in the capital with the thieves and burnings but police barely showed up, we had to coordinate groups to make rounds all night. <br /><br />The president tells he is trying to keep the peace but only for them and the most rich people! Even the high class support us, not because of money but a sence of justice. Please help us to spread the real news, the ones that are on the independent media.
Comment184	COMMIES!
Comment 184.1	Privatize roads, abolish medicare end socialism!
Comment185	Most of the protest have been in peace, the media of Chile only shows the violence and destruction in protests. The president declared war on Chilean people because he&#39;s afraid of losing power. There are many videos showing evidence of Carabineros (Chilean Police force) that are looting, repressing peaceful protesters and causing destruction.
Comment186	Socialism sucks
Comment187	I&#39;m from Chile, military forces on night are shooting like crazy I can hear it , watch some videos on Facebook and Instagram, you&#39;ll see a different story
Comment 187.1	omar zarate wena ctm
Comment 187.2	@Dorado Lucky Dragon the truth is that the police in Chile are quartered and literally let out very small groups of inmates and thieves only to cause fear in the people, the Chilean press hides a lot of information, at the level that all people know and do not  trust them, unfortunately they keep us very censored and try to hide many evidence and information as an independent international press and the same Chilean people.  I am from Chile, in the capital of Santiago.
Comment 187.3	Sue Grimm dude BY LAW “in toque de queda” (you know is when the govt say you can’t go outside) the cops can’t shoot you, they just have to take u to the police station and give u a fine... so no shooting no violence, and trust me people doesn’t need five bullets in their bodies to understand. Get it? Oh and well you can say that if someone try to evade the fine they can shoot him? Actually... yes, but still no, i mean they are suppose to be strongers and have the abilities to take u down quickly to arrest. I apologize for my english but well i hope this can help you to understand better the situation.
Comment 187.4	They are not! and if they are is because we were on  curfew and nobody suppose to be in the streets! Also people were and still are  looting. What do you want from a police or a military to get you home with a lullaby cradle song baby!

Comment190	People are getting tired of your shit.Get the hint?
Comment191	It&#39;s funny how many Chileans think they are white like Americans and look down on people of color from countries such as Haiti, Venezuela, and Colombia. Now, the world is seeing their true identities. They aren&#39;t any better or worse than their LATAM neighbours.
Comment192	Esos carros de metro los coloco el gobierno nada les costaba guardarlos en bodega mentirosoa
Comment193	They are for the benefit of the people and human rights!<br />Ask the police to exercise restraint, just as you asked the Hong Kong government.
Comment194	"Flora Cortez<br />10 hours ago<br />To clarify what Jorge Aguayo says below.<br />The march had no political colour. Absolutely not. I see that some of the people commenting are still in the past. The marches and pot banging was the end product of the injustices the Chilean government is loading on everyone. Life is very hard there at the moment. Every public service like light, water, gas, public transport or health is in private hands. These private enterprises can charge and raise cost and fares as constantly as they like, while salaries remain extremely low and haven&#39;t been raised for years. What really happened is that DELINQUENTS got involved in looting using the marches as their own excuse to damage and steal. It&#39;s them not the honest people of Chile who created this terrible situation. The main responsibility is on the Government which has created laws where people are robbed of their own money. Money like superannuation that can not be withdrawn until you are 81 years old. YOUR OWN MONEY, while the ones who manage your superannuation live like kings with the money and profits that is not theirs. Old people are committing suicide because their retiring pay does not allow them to afford the minimum to survive and remember, they are not allowed to withdraw their own superannuation after reaching retiring age. They have to way until they are 81, EIGHTY ONE!<br />The power is in the hands of politicians who are insensible to the real needs of their own people. They create or change laws to accommodate and protect their own interests eg;  raising their own incredible hight salaries or freeing them from paying tax, just to say some. The people of Chile deserves better. Deserves a fair country, that looks after them, not a small group that profits from them letting them down, dying and starving."
Comment195	Please investigate properly! There is enough footage showing that the majority of Chileans are protesting peacefully! As seen on social media, Police and Military stand by while looters enter the big malls. <br />They are fueling the riots, starting fires and stealing. Look for the footages, inform yourselves properly before contributing to a distorted picture of what is actually happening. At the end the truth will come out and it&#39;s always better to have reported the real happenings and not a version that benefits Chile&#39;s corrupt government. Don&#39;t you think?
Comment196	It started like this in sudan........
Comment197	We scream in the streets:<br />IT ISN&#39;T FOR THE $30<br />IT IS FOR THE 30 YEARS<br />30 years of abuse, we&#39;re taking no more. We thought Pinochet dictatorship was over, by voting NO. But the same people have been on the power for all these years, they have stolen our money, they&#39;re letting people die in MISERY, while the World thinks this is the Latin American Economic Paradise. BECAUSE EVERYTHING HERE IS PRIVATE, OUR RETIREMENT, OUR WATER, OUR HEALTH, THERE&#39;S NOTHING HERE WE DON&#39;T PAY FOR, WHILE PEOPLE WITH GROTESQUE AMOUNTS OF MONEY EVADE TAXES AND CONTRIBUTIONS. CHILE HAS WOKE UP, AND WE&#39;RE NOT GOING TO FALL ASLEEP AGAIN! ¡EVADIR, NO PAGAR, OTRA FORMA DE LUCHAR!
Comment 197.1	in england the boss of a bankrupt bank (fred goodwin) gets a one million £ taxpayer pension !! and the people are forced to pay from taxes. even though he left the bank in 2008 after bankrupting it.
Comment 197.2	its the same in england. exactly the same, but they thought it was the EUs fault. so it will be interesting how that works out.
Comment198	I’m from Chile and I can say that this news shows only the destruction of metro, street and the job of police, but never says the most important thing, Chile finally woke up after many years with a shit of state. People protest and looking for equality and dignity. In Chile, people who are rich always are more rich while poor people work everyday for a misery salary. Well, I think that it’s very important to have information, but tv hides too much.
Comment 198.1	@曱甴杀虫剂 The low salaries, retirements and health issues is not a today problem ,  is being happening for the last 30  or more  in Chile. And after Pinochet we had sociaialist in the government,  pretty much. Pinera is the first democrat in the government. Many of the communist in Chile don&#39;t want him, they want somebody from their own party. That&#39;s why in the Sao Paulo Forum, the chilean communist and Maduro came together to bring this government, there&#39;s so much more about this that people don&#39;t know believe me. search in youtube, Sao Paulo Forun and Chile, listen what the own Maduro says about his plans in Chile and Latinoamerica.
Comment 198.2	@Joe Hoang First of all I am a democrat, I will never vote for a communist. USA has economy sanctions on Venezuela but they get help from Russia and Cuba. Excuse me but Venezuelan vote it for him because they didn&#39;t know what kind of monster is Maduro. Now they take control over in the elections so nobody else can win. SEE IT !!
Comment 198.3	曱甴杀虫剂 They are on the streets because between 2/3 to 3/4 of the country earn less than $700 a month. And almost everything there is privatized and you have to pay for. And prices in Chile are sky high. And they could vote, but no matter who they voted for never changes anything. Their Constitution is still from the time of the dictatorship that overthrew their elected president and then assumed power in Chile for 17 years.
Comment 198.4	Sue Grimm How are you a Democrat if you probably supported a coup against a democratically elected president in 2002? The Carter Institute still calls the elections in Venezuela among the most transparent in the world. Guaido hasn&#39;t received any votes at all. And you do realize that Venezuela is subjected to harsh sanctions, right? If not for the sanctions they would economically struggle because of the declining oil price, but nobody would be starving.
Comment 198.5	@曱甴杀虫剂 Chile is a free country! I don&#39;t know where are you getting all that info but is wrong. Pinera is a Democrat. Free Chile of what...????
Comment199	By will or by force ... Go people people go! I e known since the female president of child left you all have a hard time with the.ding to the social needs of your people. Bueno suerte ... Y para Oregon necisita ayuda para Oregon es equal .. no idea if I spelled it correctly.

Every protest march we&#39;ve done were completely pacific (we dance, play music, sing and scream), but they don&#39;t really care about the PEOPLE.

Comment 208.1	catalina AdeA BBC is so willing to set fires all around the world with fake news, biases opinions and superior viewpoints. However, they don’t report that much about the protest in UK. Shitty biased media who claims unbiased. Ironically shame!
Comment209	The problems in Chile are economic. Our people are indebted at 2.3, up to 20 times their salary. The retirement system for our elders is the business of banking and large economic groups. A month in college is the equivalent of 2 monthly income. Chile exploded and at this moment there is a social outbreak that will decant in a revolutionary change. There is no other way out here
Comment210	The truth is Chile has being robbed by 30 years of so called Democracy by politicians and big foreing corporations.. The AFP is robbing the elders their money to give it to companies and stocks and make big buck with it.

Comment216	What a bunch of biased nonsense. Thanks BBC. Great reporting. You are part of the globalized unrest.
Comment217	Why don’t they tell how the army is killing people with no gun power? It is not only the metro. It is the water, education and so much more.
Comment 217.1	@22nd shut up &quot;facho qliao&quot;
Comment 217.2	@Marcelo where do you live?? Are you from chile?? cause i am, and i can easly say that every word from yout comment its actually fake
Comment 217.3	@Joe Hoang economy slavery and repression.
Comment 217.4	People is desperate because in Chile there is an economic crisis, and they have no work (hence no money) and in Chile as the neoliberal paradise it is, if you have no money you don&#39;t have access to pretty much any human right namely education for your children, healthcare, housing, etc...the government is trying to apply the shock doctrine as in the 70s and the army is killing civilians. The wealth tough has already concentrated so much that there is not a middle class and the country is slowly becoming a dystopian look alike of Elysium.
Comment 217.5	Marcelo There are so many inaccuracies in your comment. Mainly by you leaving out crucial information. Chile&#39;s main income source has been copper and they have almost 50% of the world&#39;s copper supply and there has been great demand. Most based on nationalized copper. So Chile&#39;s so called economic success has little to do with free market principles. Also, 3 out of 4 Chileans earn less than $700 a month. That comes with high payments for things such as schooling, electricity, etc. Virtuallg everything is privatized in Chile. So that wealth is in the hands of a small sector of society. And about Argentina. Ever since the dictatorship all three economic crashes in Argentina have been caused by non Peronist governments. Even in 2001 the big crash happened from liberalizing the markets and was preceded by privatizations. And about Chile&#39;s private retirement or pension system. Who do you think bails that out? Who pumps all the money into the market when it fails? And of course this ignores massive state subsidies and procurement that helps companies and keeps their stock prices up.
Comment218	Porque no muestran algunos de los videos donde aparecen carabineros empezando incendios?, donde estan los videos de las familias que salen a marchar pacificamente?, porque solo muestran la parte mala de todo?.

Comment221	Fire and Blood, Vamos Chile por un Pais Justo..
Comment222	Eso les pasa por corruptos abran los ojos no se agan los pendejos

Comment228	We are not giving up!!! Even tho the mass media and chilean press wants to deceive people by showing robbery and chaos , in the streets we are fighting against repression, army and police are shooting at protester while the president is still saying that we are delinquents and thiefts but we want justice cause life cost in chile is getting expensive every year!! Water, food, energy,, ticket transportation, health , education among other are the items we cant afford cause we are living with no money to spend in others things but paying bills, huge tax prices and ticket transportation. The president does not want to hear peoples demands and people is dying due repression .
Comment229	George Soros puppets causing chaos everywhere.
Comment 229.1	No. This was something that had to happen years ago. It was a time bomb. They steal most of our pensions (we can&#39;t even go and say give me all my money, they pay it to us in monthly payment), tax is 19%, we pay for streets when we use them (tolls), when we buy oil (specific tax)  and once a year when we have to pay for &quot;permiso de curculacion&quot;. We have to pay for health, for education and a high price for public transport, prices that can be compared to the most expensive European prices. The products in the supermarkets are as high and sometimes higher than in Europe. And to that add that at least 50% of the people earn less than US$500.<br /><br />Like I said, 19% taxes and we have NO benefits. They steal almoat everything. And that is the tax you pay when you buy stuff. If you add what they discount from your wage it&#39;s more.... They stole the right to fish in the beat areas of the ocean and gave it for free to the 7 families that own Chile. And the list goes on and on.<br /><br />If you want to know more, go search for info at &quot;Fundacion Sol&quot;. Independent organization that does research on these topics.
Comment 229.2	Lol dumbass
Comment230	"Those people who have noticed the large number of protests and riots going on around the globe at present might find this interesting ; <a href=""http://www.deagel.com/country/United-Kingdom_c0209.aspx"">http://www.deagel.com/country/United-Kingdom_c0209.aspx</a><br />These are figures for the UK, now and in 2025, but you can visit the main countries page to see every country of the world.<br />You have to ask why it is expected for all western countries to lose massive numbers of its population <b>WITHIN THE NEXT 6 YEARS.</b>"
Comment231	You raise the price of metro that what&#39;s happens . here in Canada they raise the price of metro, auto insurance and more etc and we take in the ass... We dont protest because people here are to lazy, weak... Everywhere else they atand up for their rights.. Congrats chile... But i don&#39;t agree with breaking businesses and etc.. Peaceful protest
Comment232	HK STAND WITH CHILE
Comment 232.1	@Unknown ? As a Chinese, I&#39;m glad that you can stay rational instead of keeping bias to China gov and people
Comment 232.2	@abc 123 Ok, but I&#39;ll do some research, but thanks for your opinion.
Comment 232.3	@Unknown ? BTW, up to now, China mainland have never done anything to Hong Kong, the China mainland leadership doesn&#39;t even mention HK issue.

Comment 232.5	@Leith x Ok, I just wanted say China must respect Hong Kong will.
Comment233	One thing not stated here is the corruption of the military and police. The media has ignored this from the start, there is proof of the police and military causing fires and vandalising buses as justification for their disgusting acts against the people of Chile.

Comment 238.1	Si tu quieres regalar tu pension, pagar por servicios basicos a precios mas altos que incluso europeos, pagar por productos que son tan caros como en Europa mientras ganamos menos que alla. Pagar impuestos tan altos como los europeos mientras obtienes ningun beneficio a cambio...... Cosa tuya. El resto nos cansamos de los abusos.
Comment 238.2	El gobierno debe tener reflexión sobre la gente y dejar de lado a los delincuentes que se aprovechan porque así no solucionaremos nada
Comment 238.3	Nadie quiere las cosas gratis, sólo se piden rebajas, tenemos un sueldo mínimo miserable al igual que las pensiones y todo va siempre en alza menos lo que comenté, siempre que alguien reclama sus derechos es considerado, flojo o comunista, aprende a ser empatica y preguntarte porque el descontento !

Comment241	If they burn the city down for just fare hike, imagine what would happen when they find out Pisco is not from Chile.
Comment 241.1	HAHA...so true.
Comment242	¡Los manifestantes necesitan liderazgo! Necesitan a alguien que les dé coordinación, obediencia y no sea violento. Deben seguir cómo Joshua Wong lo hace en Hong Kong con sus protestas a favor de la democracia. Sin un líder, los ciudadanos están moviendo objetivos si no tienen un plan establecido.<br /><br />&quot;The Protesters need leadership! They need someone to give them coordination, obedience, &amp; not to be violent. They need to follow how Joshua Wong does in Hong Kong with his Pro-Democracy Protests. Without a leader, then the citizens are moving targets if they don&#39;t have a plan in place.&quot;

Comment248	Always remember: There is the media&#39;s version of events, and then there is the reality. I pray for Chile and hope the situation on the ground is not as bad as the news is making it sound.
Comment 248.1	People is desperate because in Chile there is an economic crisis, and they have no work (hence no money) and in Chile as the neoliberal paradise it is, if you have no money you don&#39;t have access to pretty much any human right namely education for your children, healthcare, housing, etc...the government is trying to apply the shock doctrine as in the 70s and the army is killing civilians. The wealth tough has already concentrated so much that there is not a middle class and the country is slowly becoming a dystopian look alike of Elysium.
Comment 248.2	You&#39;re right Sir. We need the military and police in the street to save our pubic and private property safe from looting, burning and destroying. Also this is not us. We like peace and solidarity. Here in Venezuelan Maduro, Cuba, Chilean inside the government communist and all his criminal organization involved to destroy our economy. By the way not just Chile, also Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Brasil even USA&gt; He wants to dominate Latinoamerica.... That&#39;s what&#39;s happening in my country
Comment 248.3	@serpentine1983 the police burned the metro
Comment 248.4	"It is easy to judge with cheap prejudices but the reality of my country is much more crude than your preconceptions if you go to twitter and facebook of my country you will see that many videos were blocked for other countries where the undercover police are seen<br />burning, stealing, swaying in the crowd to provoke violence and thus mitigate the peace of the marches, the TV is being forced to show a small part of this situation because they are making a fool of themselves before the country that already knows that these tactics are older that Rome itself and no matter how many conspiracy labels you put, within my country the population in general realized the television set-ups and the tricks of the government that it is nothing new that each government of the day blames the mob of the day , the government of allende was boycotted there is evidence about this and also about the non-suicide murder of allende, that every thing that benefits the citizenship in general is immediately labeled Marxism there is also evidence of the connection between the current rulers and the pinochet dictatorship that arises in the wake of the condor operation and kissinger&#39;s &#39;democracy&#39; plans, as of a certain moment the situation in my country does not It is a product and does not sympathize with the left or prefabricated liberalisms, a large percentage of the people of my country know that the dictatorship never left, they never wanted to take advantage of the potential of our rich country, while they plunder my country with full hands, the middle class that your statistics evoke so much is only a product of the eternal limbo produced by the debts to education,health to the payment towards foreigners for our stolen natural resources and tax-filled lifestyle and systematic dubiousness that in part ultimately pay for the comfortable life of the armed sector who without finishing school education enjoy all kinds of rights and benefits history for more One hundred years ago, he checks through his massacres that they do not appear in statistics, that they have only been so that when things like this happen their irreverent salaries and benefits do not let them see the real situation and suppress the citizenship no matter how Malthussian the ideologies of who sends them or how Machiavellian are their tactics, they never wanted to fight crime something that was proven by the show of power that they themselves did to the state of my country loves crime if it is possible causes it, you free market is as fake as piñera and its sea of ​​proven and ridiculous lies, its ideological attempts mere populist plagiarisms of previous movements its historical statistics only seen good beneficiaries of the robbery full hands in Chile we get bored of your `` freedom &#39;&#39; let&#39;s see if the people who were inside the colony dignity protected by neoliberalism kidnapped abused in sectarian style think the same thing you, I do not win anything with all this, call me conspiracy and whatever you want I will not use this channel now I prefer to go out to fight for the rights that correspond to us by nature, haha ​​goodbye peace amigou gringou continue to support the neoliberal subordination, kissinger would be proud of you<br /><br />outside the Nazis, communists and psychopaths in general of my country."

Comment285	I&#39;ve been here for only one month. But given the huge gap between the rich and the poor I&#39;ve seen in this city, this event is not surprising to me. Unfortunately,  the protestors won&#39;t get what they are asking for. To solve the real problem, if possible at all, will be a long process.

No dejen que ese gobierno corrupto que sea izquierda o derecha, ganen esta vez! Este es el momento, el momento de escribir su historia propia. No más delincuencia, concéntrense en lo que le duele la clase Elite, los bancos, las compañías que han robado por tanto tiempo. Ayúdense unos a otros, ayudan al soldado, al paco que necesite ese empuje para juntarse con ustedes, ellos también tienen un corazón.<br />No Pierdan el foco! No pierdan corazón!"

Comment298	lo que pasa en Chile no tiene color político, la gente se harto y punto, los políticos viven en una burbuja, tanto los de izquierda como los de derecha, incluyendo a los  comunistas de mierda, la clase política sigue creyendo que esto en una disputa entre un partido político y otro, pero no es así. En las marchas hay gente de varios partidos políticos, todos reclamando por igual.... los militares comenzaron a disparar armamento de guerra contra civiles, hoy saldré a marchar, espero volver... VIVA CHILE!!!

Comment 299.3	No sean ridículos.. La tv que  defiende a un delincuente porque un milico le pegó una patada en la raja por andar saqueando? Te puedo decir que la violencia que se desató en la calle es real porque lo he visto y no entiendo como aun pueden seguir justificando un movimiento que perdió lo Pacífico hace mucho.. Acá hay infiltración de partidos políticos y todos sabemos de cuales y lo fácil que es arrastrar a sus seguidores tontos útiles para no parar la destrucción
Comment 299.4	"<a href=""https://youtu.be/FNiWOQt_yzw"">https://youtu.be/FNiWOQt_yzw</a><br /><br />Lo que no se vé en la tv!!<br /><br />Ayúdanos a difundir!!!"

Comment 306.1	@matias We need to do something!

Comment 306.3	Chilean police brutally killing peaceful protesters
Comment 306.4	"The covert police are encouraging acts of violence and crime to obscure the peaceful marches and justify the use of weapons used by military personnel with drugs that decrease empathy, the minister<br /> inside denies the precense of undercover police but there are many videos that contradict that, the number of daily situations that led to this are innumerable but the citizen must think for himself and not get carried away by the Machiavellian tares.<br />the press says nothing about international treaties<br />no more nwo"

Comment312	Is BBC News accurate or non-biased?
Comment 312.1	BBC is TV, Sports, News , Internet and Radio too.Huge.
Comment 312.2	All news is biased, they have a pretty good reputation though.
Comment313	💩💩 Neoliberalismo 💩💩
Comment314	Hong Kong has been exporting violent revolution. Recently this kind of revolutions happened in Catalonia and Chile. But the attitudes of western media towards the same kind of violence in  Hong Kong and in western countries are totally different. What an irony.
Comment 314.1	Communist
Comment 314.2	@Fabio Silva the molotov, station destroy, ATM destroy are from HK
Comment 314.3	It&#39;s not hong kong protest it&#39;s yellow vest protest in France that have been exported all across the world.

Comment315	Chili El Fuego
Comment316	The western media&#39;s bias and arrogance in support of the thugs in Hong Kong will inspire thugs around the world to learn to start toppling legitimate governments and attacking police on the road
Comment 316.1	These ppl aren&#39;t thugs mate... they are students and workers...  Even old ppl , bcs retirement funds in Chile  leaves them with almost  no money, just imagine  you worked your whole life and AFP (pension&#39;s system) wastes your money  and then tell you &quot; sorry we did a bad investment now your pension is lower&quot;... <br /><br />Ppl are protesting for a better education, health care, retirement funds  and housing... I&#39;d say 99% aren&#39;t thugs.
Comment 316.2	@BubbleBlacKa So far only the thugs are charging the police, the victims don&#39;t come out for press conferences, there are no witnesses, no physical evidence, this kind of fake news is trying to stir up hatred between the government and the citizens. you are the idiot who has been brainwashed by fake news

Comment 321.1	It&#39;s was &quot;the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back&quot;, there was a lot of backlash to the government prior to this. <br />Santiago is one of the most expensive cities to live in South America because of high taxes, high fares, bad price/quality relation in health, poor pension system and lackluster inmigration system. All in the last two years.
Comment 321.2	Why? Is Tommy Robinson&#39;s ilk gonna have a hissy fit? lol  Nothing will happen except for some arrests of the bums that incited Co&#39;s Murder....GTH! xD
