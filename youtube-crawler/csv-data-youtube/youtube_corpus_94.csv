Comment9	Global Incident Map shows a Mag 7 earthquake off west coast Africa in the Gulf of Guinea, at.....2019 km deep. Hoping that&#39;s a glitch. Took lots of pictures. What would be the depth to magnitude conversion? The antipode is the Marshall Islands.
Comment 9.1	@Jill AsbillYes I questioned it myself. It stayed on the feed for a couple hours. But never showed up on ESMC or others. That&#39;s why I took pictures on my screen and kept it.

Comment16	Hey Dutch! I&#39;ve heard deep rock shearing produces frequencies much like that associated with Wind Turbines. Pierpont documented symptoms reported by individuals exposed to wind turbines, which include sleep disturbance, headache, ear pressure, dizziness, vertigo, nausea, visual blurring, tachycardia, irritability, problems with concentration and memory, and panic episodes associated with sensations of internal vibrational frequencies. This &quot;Bad&quot; feeling from specific frequencies is nothing new.<br />Considering how the population of New Zealand was recently polorised by the activities of its government. Everyone there is on edge alot lately. I hardly think people want to end it all because there MIGHT BE an earthquake. Nice of you to give folks in that country thier own 1 800 number! Yet  Another issue the government of New Zealand fails to address properly.<br />Support The Maori Nation!<br />Support South and West Pacific Islanders!!
Comment 16.1	It seems the same dark forces are ruling your country as those ruling the US.   We need to pierce the veil and find out just who is at the top of the pyramid and taking control of everything and we need to bring them down
