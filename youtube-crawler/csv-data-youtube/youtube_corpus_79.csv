Comment2	no worries  dutch when i become president u will be in charge of  usgs
Comment3	Ithink. <br /> You shou
Comment4	The Earth &#39;sleeps&#39; here in Aussie we have a stable continental shield but we&#39;re not immune to quakes which happen once in a while , but this also tends to make the population at large  sleepy about whats happening elsewhere,sometimes a quake makes into the local MSM news. Sad really,at least I&#39;ll be you Aussie ambassador.Take care, God bless and Keep on keeping on .
Comment5	I full understand that problem you have with the .9 Society.  Here in Australia, we do not have any coins smaller than a .5 cent piece.  But in ALL of the shops, they continue to advertise things for SALE AT $9.99 or $14.99 or $99.99 !   WHAT THE FU*K?   why can&#39;t they just treat us like adults instead of ignorant fools, and say the REAL PRICE!  there&#39;s no change to be given.  It&#39;s false advertising! just the same as the USGS are falsely advertising the size of Earthquakes!  LOL  so frustrating!
Comment6	I love your personality and thanks for saying the truth. It not a joke it might be evil perhaps. They’re hiding warnings from God perhaps.
Comment7	Thank you so much Dutch
Comment8	Keep speaking the Truth Dutch!!!! God Bless🙏 You and Mrs Dutchess and your Beautiful kitties ❤🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈
Comment9	COPPER - Hello, my friend ! ! !   :o)  Thank you for these videos for Dutch.  I&#39;m not receiving my notifications of his videos lately (for some reason ?!?!#%$&amp;!), so am very grateful for your help.  p.s.  I love your Koi ! ! !
Comment10	Something big is definitely getting ready to happen on the West Coast. Scientists in certain parts of the USGS are saying be ready now. USGS has been removing both fault lines off maps and earthquakes off feeds. We&#39;ve seen that happen live with Dutch doing his videos and I&#39;ve seen it on other channels as well.<br />I had read somewhere that if the undersea volcano off the coast of Oregon erupted it could possibly cause the big quake that&#39;s right at the door.<br /><br />The following info is from National Geographic where you can find the entire article .  I just picked a couple of parts I thought were  interesting and important .<br /> The Juan de Fuca plate that centered under  Central Oregon is dying where it appears that a chunk of the Juan de Fuca plate is missing.  But a missing piece is not just a hole, but a tear that’s slowly splitting the plate apart at least 93 miles beneath the surface. It can cause strong earthquakes off the southern end of Oregon and the northern section of California. Such a tear could also explain a string of curious volcanism that swoops across a broad swath of Oregon.  <br />There&#39;s also the California sheer fault Zone roughly parallel with the San Andreas Fault, and the Walker fault which is not usually mentioned . The Los Angeles Times  has an article online with a really cool animation from the 7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake where it shatters the desert floor. It&#39;s actually a very good article I really suggest people read it as it does have some pertinent information.
Comment11	Thank you coppertropicals 💖
Comment12	You kick ass duch
Comment13	Wasn&#39;t there an emergency broadcast test today?
Comment14	Some people apparently with fuzzy thinking, believe that if they deny what is going on, then it not so; like if no one is in the forest under natural routine conditions and a tree falls, they will argue that the tree didn’t make a noise; they argue a authority figure has to confirm it; and what makes this worse, is that the majority go along with it; or go along by saying nothing, accepting this fuzzy thinking. Thus, why society collectively is messed up.
Comment15	Never to mind...it is all a joke.  Pope Gregory decided to make 15days disappear from the Calendar.  And much of the world still follows that !$$#$@# 🤣🤣🤣
Comment16	we have snow in august and minus temperatures.....11 months of snow and 1 month of ice rain and hail....meteorologists tell us that we have record high temperatures and global warming now for 23 years ...each year temperatures were to raise by 2C ..?  dont trust the info

Comment19	USGS liars! Continually obfuscating the numbers, Tell the TRUTH about the data !.  If things get bigger  we, want to know about it, like surfers looking gor that big swell, but font mistepresent the numbers, when it is a matter of life or death. Its clear, you report the reality to the military,  and some arms of govt. But dont F with the truth! G&#39;day Dutchman👍🇦🇨🤠🇺🇸✌
