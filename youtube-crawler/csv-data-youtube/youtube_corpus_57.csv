Comment1	Where&#39;s it stop. Hola Mexico California. Fabulous. Baha to Juan De Fuca. Don&#39;t report Cali. They be camping on Dr beach.
Comment2	Glad to see you. How about going personal. You tube is obviously cooperating with USGS..<br />Use gmail site. Ha! Sure Coppertone can fill this report on email and gmail.
Comment3	No Dutch I would NEVER let the people who support me down. EVER. Screw them Dutch we have all had your back and it&#39;s pretty messed up to punish us. I&#39;ve literally been on the USGS Facebook , you can look for yourself on the post about the recent Ridgecrest 5.0.standing up for you, so you saying this really kinda hurts actually. I understand your frustrations, I do. But if you stop doing what you do, guess what... You do nothing more but let them win. And I&#39;ve truly been speaking out for you on the USGS Facebook. Please pull yourself together. In my honest opinion, I&#39;d stop mentioning them or hell anyone else for that matter. COMPLETELY ACT AS IF THEY DON&#39;T EXIST. This will keep you out of trouble and make a statement loud and clear. I feel like I might actually be the cause of your recent troubles because I was standing up for you. So if that is the case, I will apologize for causing you stress however, I will not stop speaking out until one of them listen. You deserve to be heard and deserve to be recognized.
Comment4	my husband and I felt a deep deep vibration under the earth last night around midnight..it came in waves and very strange.What was that in washington state.
Comment5	They just suck so bad the way they naff with you. Love you Dutch.
Comment6	Dutch I was standing up for you on the USGS Facebook page. On the post ABOUT THE 5.0 ! Soooo..... Ya.
Comment7	Dutch it&#39;s Monday and la Jolla CA just had a 2.4 sooo I&#39;m thinking energy might be transferring to the Diego area ???
Comment8	In my opinion blocking your early warnings is no different than intentional attempted murder.  Lives are saved because of you Dutch. If anything bad happens because you&#39;re blocked the blood is on their hands.
Comment9	Hey dutch dont ever give up or give in..... thats what they want.... dont let them break you and keep doing whats right... keep strong and much love to you and your family.... i also had a hard time finding your videos....ü§óü§óü§óü§ó
Comment10	Copper Tat‚Äôs stream blocked to UK viewers (all together saying video has been blocked in your country) can‚Äôt get there via Dutch either thought I should let you know ML ‚ù§Ô∏è
Comment11	It takes a Wisdom &amp; Maturity; most don‚Äôt have, to overcome you‚Äôre own stubbornness, raise yourself above &amp; still have the generosity of spirit to continue in the face of adversity. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve stuck around last near Decade because you continued beyond your own obligation that‚Äôs Special Dutch/Tat in doing so you‚Äôve created a Family here too Respect &amp; MLA ‚ù§Ô∏è
Comment12	What you you tell your family? Lol. Yes. Don‚Äôt stop warning people. You are doing great üëç
Comment13	Says private on Dutch‚Äôs page
Comment14	Dutch &amp; Copper You‚Äôre Amazing, your TruthPrints; Vital Information. TY for all you do. Blessings &amp; Love to you All ‚ù§Ô∏è

Comment 15.1	Had them everyday. None stop. Now up to. 3.0
Comment16	Well I will give a forecast there is a chastisement from God comming everyone needs to convert to Jesus&#39;s church, the catholic church, follow the laws of God and pray and do penance <br />May God have mercy on us all<br />Micha&#39;EL
Comment17	Thx you copper for always being there for Dutch man. Just wanted to tell you how much we appreciate you. Much love and blessings.
Comment18	Is there anyone on here from California that left due to Earthquake events lately? Anyone at all? Or are all of you just going to wait until it pops and take your chances?<br />Please don&#39;t make excuses. Excuses can&#39;t save you when there&#39;s nowhere to run and no fuel to leave. Jus&#39; sayin&#39;.
Comment19	You are Awesome!
Comment20	Dutch, they screening your forecast brings more attention on your abilities, and they being inept .
