Comment9	Thank you  Copper and Dutch! Once again, my Fb crew is getting the chance to educate themselves by watching your reports via sharing. I wish folks would watch, and start a dialogue with me. Alas and alack, they mostly seem to be concerned about trivial garbage. There is also this sad lack of looking beyond themselves, i.e., if it does not directly affect them personally, they couldn&#39;t care less if a chunk of the U.S. is destroyed by earthquakes, as long as they aren&#39;t in danger. Sorry, didn&#39;t mean to go off on a rant. &#39;Til next time, mi amigos, ciao! ✌♥️😸
