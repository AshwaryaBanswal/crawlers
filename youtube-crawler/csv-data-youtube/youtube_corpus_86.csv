Comment13	You want the sheep herders to be honest? That&#39;s the opposite of their agenda. Real scientists have open minds - information contrary to their research results in a recalibration of perspective to get closer to an ultimate goal.  SpaceX  recalibrates because their product will never succeed otherwise,  Pharmceutical companies recalibrate because they can&#39;t rape peoples&#39; bank accounts with a product that does nothing.  USGS balks at alternative (especially successful) concepts because they aren&#39;t about earthquake forecasting, they are about seismic mystery to ensure their massive federal funding continues.<br /><br />Write a nice business letter to Trump.  Outline how your work assists Americans in the States and our troops overseas.  Tell him that you want your findings to serve our Country but you can&#39;t succeed with the censorship social media is applying, and with the USGS working so hard to debunk your proven methods.  I bet you will hear back from him.
