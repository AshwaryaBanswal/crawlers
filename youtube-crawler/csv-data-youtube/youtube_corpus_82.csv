Comment6	Dutch theirs a huge explosion in Siberia Russia take a look today Monday August 52019
Comment7	If you&#39;re going to give e/q preparedness information, what you keep suggesting in your videos is NOT what emergency services recommend, and can hurt those not properly prepared. It makes us in EMS cringe. Suggest you add proper links in your resources above.  Stick to predicting e/q&#39;s, you&#39;re very good at that.
Comment8	and now toeday, Tuesday 6th August, (Australia time) there is another earthquake that has been REPORTED IN CHINA!!!   bah ha ha!  Just as you predicted again Dutch!  Call out the USGS for NOT reporting earthquakes on the Asian Continent, and WOW!  suddenly there appears an earthquake!  LOL
Comment9	Thank you Dutch I saw this live second time around better❤️❤️❤️🙏🇺🇸🇮🇱
Comment10	Love your russian accent and sense of humor.
Comment11	You talk too much
Comment12	Acoustic sounds were a science project way back in high school,shattering glass wine goblets was a treat,ya ,with the right resonance you can cause a quake,might have to play with the amplitude and power a bit
Comment13	Scientists used to be respected?<br />Now considered political 🐷🐷💰
Comment 13.1	Dutch IS a scientist
Comment14	Just a few years ago, an earthquake of 6 in magnitude was considered an epic event of biblical proportions. Today , a 7 in magnitude is so common we don&#39;t even consider it
Comment 14.1	NO--it was NOT. I am 66 years old. So even to me a 6 is not shocking. Nor the 7.1 we had. And I LIVE up near Ridgecrest. Not worried. lat desert land--not overpasses to fall on us. Newer homes. Can camp out back if need be.
Comment15	Thanks Copper I Posted
Comment16	The ring of fire is lighting up. Volcanoes are awakening one after another.
Comment17	Crack in the earth?<br />That dam squirrel
Comment18	Thank you Russia, way to go Dutch!😳
Comment19	I wonder how many other government agencies besides USGS, manipulate the data they are responsible to gather and report? Scary!
Comment20	Is it funny business, or strange business, or just odd business, or maybe better said as unethical business, as to manipulating, not reporting and down grading of earthquakes?
