Comment7	"BREAKING: Al-Baghdadi Killed Again! US Claims ISIS Leader Dead, Russia Very Skeptical! <a href=""https://youtu.be/PQzgfAi7KiI"">https://youtu.be/PQzgfAi7KiI</a>"
Comment8	Never ever seen a president bragging so much, giving details of someone’s death may it be an evil person. What is this announcement. Some decency man, keep it short and to the facts. Hopefully this guy gets impeached soon and removed from the public scene as he’s behaving disrespectfully of his position &amp; mission like no other president ever did in history. Good riddance
Comment9	Assad might know a thing or two about US/Saudi funded terrorist groups.  He was reported saying:<br /><br />All in all, it’s unlikely that death of the IS leader – if he really was<br /> killed – and even the ultimate destruction of the terrorist group would<br /> change anything....The root of the problem – the Wahhabi ideology that <br />is “more than two centuries old” would not disappear at once. The <br />radical Islamist thought and al-Baghdadi were merely US tools all <br />along....those tools could easily be re-purposed elsewhere.
Comment10	Ahh, now it makes sense why we gave Turkey and Russia  pieces of Syria and essentially stabbed our &quot;expendables&quot; the Kurds in the back.
Comment11	200+ Terrorists disliked this video.

Comment13	"why is IS islamic state it should be israeli state <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23trumpisdumb"">#trumpisdumb</a>"
Comment14	Next?
Comment15	Not only is the terrorist dead but his flesh is being eaten by dogs and rats he is being digested and becoming  shit on the ground is what remains of their fearless terrorist leader. When you step in dog shit remember you’re stepping in your leaders remains America is laughing at you terrorist and we are coming for the rest of you. Period.<br />🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Comment16	This is just one of many reasons I love Trump, because he doesn&#39;t hold anything back when he is speaking and told the truth about that piece of shit that was killed! If that would have been Obama, Hillary or some other liberal making that speach they would be apologizing to everyone for killing that shit bag and then released 50 ISIS members from prison to show them how much they are sorry for killing their leader!<br /><br />As someone who served 11 yrs in the US army (2000-2011) with 2 tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, I wish I would have had the opportunity to kill more of those shit bags when I was over there!
Comment17	BULLSHIT LIES
