Comment1	.The gutter bbc and rotten to the core 2 Party system, along with its Treasonous Political class, along with 80 % of the UK Media and the the house of snakes its all over for their Orwellian, Deep State, Illuminate agenda and their reprehensible philosophy, its like watching a snakes that have swallowed their own poison/venom, they writhe and twist before the inevitable..Vote BREXIT Party at the next GE.... DRAIN THE SWAMP
Comment2	Where the fuck is guy Fawkes when we need him most.....
Comment3	let votes , and get out
Comment4	pifff OdOr ,Brexit means brrrexit ,both mean nothing but a filthy OdOrous  falseflag  show betrayal of European Identity ,means a betrayal to the traitor
Comment5	BBC ,why don&#39;t you like democracy?
Comment6	Well if they extend the deadline again or sell us out I hope the 17 million betrayed finish what Guy Fawkes started on November the 5th üòÇüòÇ Civil war brewing?
Comment7	In the near future, when NI and Scotland will be part of the EU, this brexit referundum plus 3 1/2years MPs circus will make history. It will help pass a law on that voting prevelages should only been given to people whit a certain level of IQ and or education, and a second one on politicians being free of any colusion and be legally responsible for any lie/omission given to their constituents. This to avoid committing such suicidal mistake again...
Comment8	Not just will Scotland inevitably leave and at some point be accepted by the EU as a member state, followed later by Wales, also NI will finally join Ireland.¬†<br /><br />People in England meanwhile, will be split down the middle, will stop saying sorry to anybody who bumps into them, will have to give up drinking port and good wine, get drunk on cheap holidays in Hull and Bristol instead of Ibiza and Cannes, go to do-it-yourself hospitals, look at oranges in paintings in galleries to remind them,  shop in 10-pound shops (formerly pound shops), forced to hang Fartgarbage&#39;s portraits in their living rooms, wear only blue double-breasted blazers with beige pants, brown shoes and white socks, pretend that crooked teeth are the latest thing, close down their airports and souvenir shops, and wave a Coronation mug at their starved bulldogs.

Comment12	Boris chances doesn‚Äôt look promising. Oops
Comment13	Regardless of the vote outcome I&#39;m sure the scheming remainers will concoct some new imaginative way to try to block us leaving!
Comment14	&#39;&#39;A Great new deal&#39;&#39;? Bojo trying to sound like Trump. Lame. The day we all get a chance lets vote this clown and his cirrcus act out of office. He is a cheat, he sold us out. You want 5 more years with this clown in #10 throwing his weight around?
Comment15	What is all that punching in the air? Is Boris at a football match?
Comment16	For everyone who thinks that not choosing this deal = ‚ÄúNo Deal‚Äù ... you wrong, for no deal must be Separate vote, if they not choose deal today we will have Extension ( if EU allow )
Comment 16.1	Denis Muthuon And I don‚Äôt blame them, UK act like spoiled kid who use parents car, credit card and house on tropical island but still shouting at them that he want more and there was a time that he had more ü§£
Comment 16.2	But EU does not allow it. No more, they are fed up with UK mess.
Comment17	No deal
Comment18	we bled for you in africa, europe, asia, we bled for 30 years of more less civil war, &quot;our only crime? being too loyal and for that we are kicked&quot; (lord carson 1922) please for the love of our country and yours vote this down or the u.k. is doomed

Comment20	Does PM Johnson&#39;s deal allow other European countries to fish in UK waters?
Comment 20.1	@Flu Virus have to say, in 50 years from now, shall UK wants to conducts business/export with Europeans they still will have to follow EU regulations, unless UK swap EU near market with US far away market and therefore will have to comply with US standards and compete with Asian and Indian prices thus lower employees standards... that&#39;s the down side of globalisation. What did you think?
Comment 20.2	@Zhang Ruyi But the remainers don&#39;t want a no deal so might vote for it. The UK will enter a transition period when it leaves the EU. During the transition period the UK won‚Äôt be a member of the EU but will still have to abide by its rules. For example, the UK would still have to contribute to the EU budget until 2020 along with paying for any other financial commitments made as an EU member.
Comment 20.3	@Flu Virus If this is the case, then what is the point of supporting a surrender treaty? It is better to leave with no deal. However, the remainer MPs will not allow for this to happen. They do not allow for a GM. So, the only option is to extend, which the EU has said they would not allow, and go out eventually with no deal, perhaps after a GM. <br />Does this mean that the UK will be a vassal state of the EU if the deal is approved?
Comment 20.4	Zhang Ruyi The eu will still have laws over us, the deal is not brexit.
Comment21	typical BBC bias ... the result of the vote will go against .. so stop fudging the numbers and be honest for a change.
Comment 21.1	@Electric avenue Bikes That went dark quickly. That sucked for them to be treated so poorly...
Comment 21.2	BBC is honest and in war my family were listing  to the news ,before the germans took them away .and   kicked them hard in the face and ears . until they could not hear or speak no more ,so go fuck off.
Comment22	What a rank and utter nonsensical analysis.. The BBC has raced its way down to the bottom of relevance....  Could it be possible that the conservatives themselves rebel and vote with the opposition?
Comment23	Bojo evil viral deal ..No No No to Bojo treason  deal.
Comment24	From Emannual Macron&#39;s comments that France no longer favours any further extension to the Withdrawal Agreement, it seems to me that Boris may have convinced Macron secretly some time back to countenance no further delays if the EU and UK managed to agree a new deal. That is why Boris has steadfastly stated that the UK will leave the EU on the 31st Oct knowing that if a new deal was not agreed in the U.K. parliament and he was forced to seek an extension, the U.K. would crash out anyway due to a FRANCE veto on an extension. I wonder what the quid pro quo is, and if true it&#39;s a master stroke of strategy on Boris&#39; part.
Comment25	Now there‚Äôs a thing they say members of parliament attention span is down from 12 seconds to 3 seconds this is less than the 9 second attention span of of the average goldfish?
Comment26	Why do the BBC put either ugly or fat women on breakfast? Who wants to see that grosse Ness first thing in the morning

Comment 29.2	Thank you for real news, BBC is incapable of truth.
Comment30	Well then if they don&#39;t back this deal then NO DEAL is the only option üòä

Comment42	It&#39;s a stitch up the EU set this bull shit up
Comment43	Could someone explain how it will effect workers‚Äô rights and consumer protections exactly? The British parliament will be held accountable for these, they will implement the laws, correct? So, if workers right are abolished or radically changed negatively and there are unsafe products on the shelves can&#39;t the people just vote in another government that will return and or improve both worker and consumers rights or standards? Consumers can also choose what they do or do not consume. I just don&#39;t understand this argument in relation to leaving the EU. In theory the voting public should have more control over this not less after leaving. This is a serious question, explain it to me.
Comment44	Only vote we want is a ge to get rid of this entire parliament and elect the brexit party

Comment46	oh shit here we go again
Comment47	Took their time
Comment48	It&#39;s hard to over-estimate the importance of tomorrow&#39;s vote in Parliament. The result is on a knife-edge.<br /><br />But it&#39;s clear to me that there is nothing in this Brexit deal to benefit our country. It will leave people worse off, jobs harder to find, businesses struggling and a race to the bottom as environmental and social standards are dumped.<br /><br />It looks like a huge con on the British people because, if the vote succeeds, it will take us into a short transition period - giving people the completely false impression that there will be no impact on living standards, or workers‚Äô rights and consumer protections outside the EU. Boris Johnson will doubtless use this opportunity to try to win an election and put in power a hard-right government which will then run down the clock to the end of the transition period so we end up leaving with no deal. One of the Conservative hardliners has already admitted that this is the plan.<br /><br />Theresa May used to say &quot;no deal is better than a bad deal&quot;. This deal is both: a bad deal with a no deal hidden inside.<br /><br />I plan to speak both in the debate, and at the People&#39;s Vote rally outside. I hope you can be there.<br /><br />(Caroline Lucas - Green MP for Brighton)
Comment 48.1	@Truck Taxi poor mentality.   The only reason why &quot;you want this over&quot;  is because its taken too long.    Thats like you getting a heart surgery, but want to leave the hospital after inadequate work, because its &quot;taking too long&quot;    fool.    U do realise that people including yourself could potentially be HEAVILY impacted by this deal.   Living standards are hard enough as it is :/
Comment 48.2	@Truck Taxi we will leave but not with this shit deal

Comment62	This is not the time to cheer or throw stones. The referendum passed in 2016 by 52%. Now it&#39;s down to the wire and we don&#39;t like the new deal. We can take potshots at the conservatives in the next election but now is the time to take this seriously or the UK economy will be in a shambles for the next decade.
Comment63	<b>Johnson&#39;s Brexit deal    New snap poll by YouGov.  Some 41 per cent of the people polled said they want Parliament to pass the deal, while only 24 per cent said they didn&#39;t</b><br /><b>So, those in favour of the deal outnumber those against by 1.7 to 1. Support for passing the deal rises to 67 per cent among those that voted Leavers and</b><br /><b>71 per cent of Conservative voters in the poll support Johnson‚Äôs deal.  Any MP voting against Johnson&#39;s deal runs a massive risk of losing their seat at the forthcoming General Election</b>

Comment67	It&#39;s not a deal, it&#39;s a treaty &amp; a shit one at that.<br />The idea that the EU won&#39;t give another extension, if we refuse this treaty is absurd &amp; everyone knows it.<br />If this treaty is rejected we will end up with an extension &amp; I am guessing an election.<br />One thing to be said in favour of the treaty is that it does get us out of the EU, no more extensions, no second referendum &amp; no fear of article 50 being revoked to put us back to square one.<br />Scrapping this new treaty at a later date, would be a far simpler affair than Brexit.
Comment68	TIME TO RIOT PEOPLE OF THE UK
Comment69	What the F is the matter with everyone? The Eu wont budge too much, the imbeciles in parliament dont want to leave without a deal, Boris has got a deal but people are not happy. So we will leave without a deal ffs

Comment71	Yes, Boris Johnson knows how to surprise! Despite the fact that he adopted ‚Äúkamikaze tactics‚Äù and resolutely led the country towards a hard Brexit, at the last moment the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom was able to find a compromise with EU leaders. The transaction was announced in the morning of October 17, and in the evening of the same day it was approved by the EU summit. Now the final word is for the British Parliament, where Johnson‚Äôs coalition partners have already rejected the deal. However, help to the Prime Minister may come from Her Majesty&#39;s opposition: up to fifty members of the Labor Party can support the agreement.
Comment72	A &#39;fake&#39; deal till the end of 2020. They are experts in put &#39;fake&#39; laws. Is not enough 10 years of Tories??Nhs, foodbanks, knifecrime, education, housing.. In everything they have failed
Comment73	The only way to sort this out for once and for all is to had another referendum with two options :leave with this deal or remain. Simple enough,

Comment76	There will be no deal, there will be no Brexit<br />The strongest men (Bercow &amp; Corbyn) want to revoke Brexit and the rest of the parliament are nothing but a bunch of idiots<br />Yes the UK could stay in the EU, but needs to be learned a lesson
Comment77	Boris Johnson has done it again .its  a NO DEAL
Comment 77.1	@Fonzie I do, at least to the extent that there are many factors which influence democracy, where we disagree is whether the two are mutually exclusive.
Comment 77.2	@Des Oliver Sounds like you agree with me lol
Comment 77.3	@Fonzie Many politicians write for newspapers, Boris Johnson began his career as a Journalist. There is a list complied online of the decades of anti-EU stories released by the tabloid media over the years, and as you rightly said, the media has a significant impact on changing perceptions too. This is why the information to emerge from the Cambridge Analytica scandal (targeted data harvesting) posses such a threat to democracies all over the world. I&#39;m glad you agree with me :)
Comment 77.4	@Des OliverLike the continual media bias which will influence more people than mp&#39;s worthless words.
Comment 77.5	@Fonzie If your claim is &#39;both sides lied&#39; then by your own admission, the public was in even less of a position to make an informed decision. <br /><br /><br />To which claims are you referring?
Comment78	The country doesn&#39;t want the European Treaty, but to just leave!
Comment 78.1	@Flu Virus you are leaving the eu with this deal
Comment 78.2	@Si Dog Ducati Democracy
Comment 78.3	Si Dog Ducati Because the deal is not brexit, we voted to leave the eu.
Comment 78.4	Ermm how have you come to that conclusion?
Comment79	What if he doesnt get the required votes? Wuld the extention be given by EU or no deal will be done by PM?
Comment 79.1	@mudasir khan that law doesn&#39;t prevent the PM from allowing a no-deal Brexit, it just means he has to ask the EU for a delay until January if parliament doesn&#39;t approve the deal. However, because the EU doesn&#39;t want to allow another delay, it means that the EU might force a no-deal Brexit by kicking us out if this current deal doesn&#39;t pass.
Comment 79.2	@hatching draggon what about the law passed preventing PM from a no-deal brexit? Is it still in effect?
Comment 79.3	The President of the European Commission has said no extension will be granted. If this deal doesn&#39;t go through it&#39;s very likely that a no-deal Brexit will take place. The opposition members would actually be wise to vote this through because it&#39;s far better (for them) than a no-deal.
Comment80	If they pass Boris deal they would be disgraced considering the deal is far worse than the deal PM May had negotiated
Comment 80.1	Any deal is betrayal.
Comment81	Boris is Fecked .....roll on Saturday Night ....Big Celebrations ..... ‚úãüèºü§öüèº

Comment83	The UK will slide back into the filthy dump it was before the EU directives forced it to clean water standards, clean beaches and decent health and safety. When we leave the EU we go back to the filth, endless recessions and misery of the 70s....

Comment84	Anything‚Äôs better than the evil, silly and dangerous Labour Party
Comment 84.1	@K M D 123 Both the Tory Party and the Labour Party have  dangerous, or maybe a better of way of saying it, two Looney extreme  leaders, Johnson and Corbyn.
Comment 84.2	Owain Garside the Tory party is nowhere near as dangerous, evil and silly as the Labour Party
Comment 84.3	I know, we can have the evil, silly dangerous Tory Party instead.
Comment85	If I was Prime Minister like Boris rn an the deal is defeated I&#39;d either declare a national emergency or porogue parliament again
Comment86	No impact assessment until after.
Comment 86.1	They know what the reports findings will be, they won&#39;t release it.
Comment87	I hope someone producers would be so inspired to get these Parliament intrigues into BoJo Brexit movie
Comment88	Even of labour think the deal is alright they can&#39;t vote for it, thats like saying yea u did a good job we were wrong so will probably abstain in protest or vote no deal an try to delay...again.

Comment99	And what about the Tory MPs who have large Remain constituencys.? Sure, labour has large leave constituencies, but bearing in mind an election in short order, and the risks involved, do you think Tories in conservative liberal marginals are going to risk their seat just to save face for Boris? This number crunching is a bit one sided. Either all will follow the whips or none. So it&#39;s trying to make exciting a forgone conclusion. It&#39;s going to Bounce the &quot;deal&quot; out. <br />From the Northern Irish perspective, acceptance will mean Union with Europe over union with Britain, and I don&#39;t see many marching along with that. ( though it would perhaps be better for NIs prosperity if it did. They&#39;ll get more from Europe than London ever Gave)

When he was a kid he wanted to be &quot;King of the World&quot;.¬†Whatever happens with that latest Brexit deal with the EU in the House of Commons, believe me, bully Boris with natural charisma and fancy blond¬†hairstyle will survive.
Comment103	This Brexit is<br />became really a big Plutocracy, ignorant and stupid<br />agony that Brexsheeters are doing and promoting. It is a completely an UK<br />politicians mess that it make me think that they will drive peoples of UK into<br />a schizophrenic nation with all those controversy and diversity. Now is no<br />doubt who is tearing peoples of UK apart. Toxic people will not be changed by<br />the alchemy of your kindness. Yes, be kind, but move on swiftly and let life be<br />their educator.

Comment 106.2	you can do that in any case. and good news is, you get to keep your country and democracy too...
Comment107	brexit threatens that special relationship with the USA and here is how... <br />the UK had the best deal in the world being on the fence between USA and EU with it&#39;s own currency one foot on each side, <br />being in one of the biggest trading blocks in the world, being USAmerica&#39;s influence IN the EU while also being the EU&#39;s influence on USAmerica. <br />Both diplomatically and economically the supremely superior position. <br />IF the UK leaves the EU then the UK will be less important to the USA. <br />THAT will make obtaining deals with USAmerica MORE difficult than easier. <br />So with brexit the UK becomes diplomatically and economically less important to both sides of that fence. <br /><br />brexit was funded to crash the pound so you can see where the asset strippers will be coming from.... <br />BOTH sides of that extremely profitable fence WE were sitting on.<br />brexit makes the UK the easy meat for the next asset stripping land grab for speculators and asset strippers from all over the world.
Comment 107.1	Public Public <br />That&#39;s a  one view , from my perspective I see sunny up lands  when those gravy train riders in parliament understand we voted to leave the EU the EU  at best  has another few years  then it&#39;s done ,  it only ever benefited Germany and there poodles France  in the long run<br /><br />Has for uk assets they where sold off long before Brexit was even a concept  to France , China, and others , the government can not fund everything ,<br /><br />I am sure the uk has stakes in other country&#39;s assets  also <br /><br />Has for trade let hope with brexit we become more of a manufacturing country again , and not so reliant on the money sector <br /><br />Has for brexit  being funded by people to crash the pound what evidence do you have of this , because James O Brian  say it&#39;s so on LBC does not make it true , and was it not that so many years ago that Blair was happy to scrap the pound for the euro until brown step in to stop him <br />So in short  long before brexit governments of all colours have been at it ,<br />It&#39;s just people like yourself the Brexit hating Media and  the political  establishment  now have a scape goat namely brexit  to blame all there woes on
Comment 107.2	Nonsense.<br /><br />More BBC Project Fear crap.
Comment108	crunching the numbers on what a brexit crashed pound and the essential services fattened up just before selling them all off would cost makes more sense.
Comment109	I like eggs I could like Breggsit But lets talk About Brexit yeah?
Comment110	The BBC follows the people of Catalonia, where freedom, democracy and human rights have been severely undermined.They are going through a crackdown just like Hong Kong people
Comment111	I am 81 years old and cannot imagine that a more important issue than BREXIT has reared its head in my lifetime.<br />Surely this issue should be put to a free vote - for each MP (of whatever party) to vote on in accordance with his/her conscience - taking into account the wishes of the constituants who voted them in. For Jeremy Corbyn to impose a 3 line whip with threats of disciplinary consequences is the act of a career politician who is simply seeking the route that will best serve his personal ambition to be our next Prime Minister. We don&#39;t want another Donald Trump over here. Boris would be bad enough but Jeremy would be even worse. Perhaps I&#39;ll just commit suicide!

Comment120	Some truly crazy comments on here. I won&#39;t spoil them for you, have a scroll and see.
Comment 120.1	Crazier in the commons
Comment121	Just get out on this deal and argue later ! If they can lie to their own people for over 3 years and change the rules with corruption shouldn&#39;t be to hard against corrupted EU üëçüëç
Comment122	What brits don‚Äôt seem to get is that it‚Äôs not a deal, it‚Äôs just a entering of the transition period, u could still end up with no deal in the end. U will again overestimate your power, and be unsatisfied with any deal in the end, and if u don‚Äôt think the EU‚ÄîUS will only do a deal in their favor is. Delusional
Comment 122.1	This is not a deal ,it merely dissolves the EU membership then the negotiations really begin inside the transition period,if nothing comes of that then a new cliff edge is established. My personal view is that this boris deal is just a trojan horse for the ERG to get their Brexit.
Comment 122.2	@Geth Creator <br />it&#39;s stay AND leave et the same time ...
Comment 122.3	An indefinite transition period that gives the EU the same control but without our say.<br /><br />This deal is not brexit
Comment123	If boris is defeated, then there will be election. Could tories led by boris johnson win against under the pretext that brexit is compromise?
Comment 123.1	@James Sempy I hope so
Comment 123.2	@Geth Creator <br />his deal won&#39;t pass: he doesn&#39;t have the numbers.
Comment 123.3	to win, Bojo/Tories should not xtend .
Comment 123.4	No, this deal has ensured Boris is unelectable unless parliament vote it down
Comment124	bojo has screwed over leave voter&#39;s
Comment 124.1	You stupid people actually  believed him .. and Farage... and Rees  Mogg .  You get what you deserve!
Comment 124.2	well leave voters have screwed over Britain.
Comment125	On Saturday More than 175 coaches will make their way to London from towns and cities across the UK, full of people asking to be asked again. Underground users have been told to expect large crowds around St Pancras, King‚Äôs Cross and Euston ‚Äì the stations that connect London to the north and Midlands.
Comment 125.1	Marilyn Sagor Remain side lied plenty by withholding information on how undemocratic the EU actually is. The EU was deliberately set up in a way so that unelected Bureaucrats (Commissioners) can dictate policy BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. MEP can only vote yes or no. There is no possible way to reform the EU. It is irreformable.
Comment 125.2	@Morag Agreed. But look where the mendacity has brought us.
Comment 125.3	"<a href=""https://youtu.be/pvZzb_hd6wo"">https://youtu.be/pvZzb_hd6wo</a>"

Comment 125.5	2016 referendum based on lies
Comment126	The deal is unlawful, according to the rules set out by Jacob Rees-Mogg. It&#39;s not going to happen, as we&#39;ll see at the last minute before crashing out.
Comment 126.1	@Ecosse UK is already gone buddy... do not waste your time, just look after number 1.
Comment 126.2	@Public Public Corrupted politicians, backhanded paid under table clearly made UNITED KINGDOM CINDERELLA who lost slipper now forever in the swamp of traitors.
Comment 126.3	@Public Public Agreed. The UK lost art of smart DIPLOMACY. Indoctrinated by Leninism and obscure socialism dead as DODO ideas. UK once best bastion of SUPREME DIPLOMACY is today as dead as DODO.(second time stated to confirm). FOREVER.
Comment 126.4	@Babalonkie I&#39;ll pick up one tiny point there. As an SNP member I will do whatever causes the most destruction to the Uk. So If a no deal, or &#39;crashing out&#39; is what is best for Scottish Independence, that is what I would go for., personally. That is not unfortunately the current position of the SNP, who I am quickly losing patience with tbqh. I voted remain, but as I have responded in all polls for the past year I would now vote Leave. As I believe leaving without a deal would utterly ruin the Uk economy thus bringing Scottish Independence multiple steps closer.
Comment 126.5	@Ecosse tell remoaners that.
Comment127	Germany as made UK government surrenders.. Cowdise as won the referendum.... People need to remember they can only rule while you vote for there lies...

Comment 130.2	Brexit, or Boris? lol
Comment 130.3	honour representative democracy which represents over 63 million population and not just a mere whiney 17.4 million.<br />brexit was funded to crash the pound and that is in noones interest except for those that have invested in the pound crashing and are ready to buy up the prefattened for market essential services which a crashed pound wont afford. i.e. a million George Soros&#39; from all over the world are waiting for the brexit hammer to fall on the pound.
Comment 130.4	You don&#39;t understand. Brexit is the <b>beginning</b> of the negotiations for the future U.K.-E.U. relation, not the end!

Comment131	What about the 16.8m people that didn&#39;t want to leave and half of the leave who don&#39;t want to leave without a deal.. Do they have a say on what&#39;s best for them based on the result of the referendum?
Comment 131.1	Andy N they don&#39;t give a shit about them, and there are a lot more people dead set against Brexit now. We are seeing the beginning of the end for Great Britain, as it wilfully moves towards &#39;failed state&#39; status.

Comment 132.3	Speaker is dancing in re-joys and scream ORDAAAAH ORDAAAAH I got my ways!
Comment133	Why on Earth would the group of former Tories just help Johnson rush through this deal just like that? He should at least wine and dine them before screwing them all over again.
Comment 133.1	@Kev T You are correct. That is exactly why Johnson had them kicked out from the party: because (maybe for once) they voted for what they felt was right for the country instead of just what the party leader told them to vote. And thus it is exactly what I&#39;d be expecting of them once more: to vote their own conscience.
Comment 133.2	@Electric avenue Bikes Ah, yes, since when did we have Johnson&#39;s deal ?
Comment 133.3	The vote shouldn&#39;t be against Boris. Or for Boris.<br />It should be what they feel is right for the country. <br />I hope that they have a more mature out look on it than you do.
Comment 133.4	3 years is rush ! u are slow .
Comment134	Same old desperate remainers every time on the comments. Undemocratic bunch of morons.

Comment138	If this gets through the dick head tories need to understand Conservative voters will never vote for them again !!
Comment139	The way the DUP were talking I thought the had a LOT more than 10 seats
Comment 139.1	they do only have 10 seats  but they also have 250,000 thousand behind them and wait till you see what happens again we got the troops over in 60s well do the fuckin same again if you annex us NO SURRENDER WAS THE CRY

Comment150	The Boris deal is not the May deal. But I still think it will be no deal. The fact that a deal is in place with the EU means the legal wording of the Benn act could be said to be fulfilled. Boris wont have to ask for an extension... Greens, Lib Dems etc. can vote it down as a stance for remain and Labour and JC can vote the deal down as a bad deal without giving a firm stance on either leave or remain (to try to prevent alienating their working class core who are by and large leave. <br />Its a political output that allows everyone in Westminster to save face...

Comment 157.3	Cycling switchbacks as someone who has always worked I can tell you why I voted labour out of power in the first place.<br />   The reason was as a working man I sick of labour shovelling benefits at people!! I personally knew people who had never worked on the equivalent of ¬£700 per week!!! absolute socialist madness, this made me vote for the first time in my life in my forties!!<br />   As to why I personally voted leave, ever encroaching eu regulation has affected my business and cost me money ‚òπÔ∏è
Comment 157.4	He didn&#39;t have to, 98% of it is May&#39;s deal, the bit that isn&#39;t is the border splitting the UK and the dismantling of all UK workers rights that was put in place collectively by the EU Parliament to stop dickheads like Johnson from riding roughshod over them. I still can&#39;t believe why the working class of this country who voted to leave believe somehow that people like Johnson and Rees-Mogg are their champions.

Comment 159.4	@Thom Youtube you are right, except that for the gov to reach a deal, it has to be approved by parliament , otherwise it&#39;s not a deal is it? But sit back and learn tomorrow ...oh, and watch your local ditches will you, they may get blocked
Comment160	Lets hope the 3 GHOSTS of EU past, future and present visit the bedside of all those voting on SAT! - I think the NEWS PAPERS should crucify anyone voting to send this country tumbling down the rabbit hole into darkness and doubt for another 3 months.
Comment 160.1	@James Sempy Barrel of apples begun rot  with Cameron, followed by mayhem May and ended by hard zionist Johnson. Not Christian, not Protestant, not Catholic, he could not care less about DUP, just to get him to #10. His great grandfather Jewish RABBI in Lituania is turning in his grave when BLONDIE on steps of # 10 shouted out he comes from MUSLIM ancestry. Yet he declared before as STRONG ZIONIST from KIBBUTZ then changed his religion? WHY? Politically correct? Why not be proud to be JEW?
Comment 160.2	@Seer Seerwealth <br />not at all. any xtension = suicide for him/Tories.  he will never do it.
Comment 160.3	@James Sempy Blondie became delusional and need help by psychiatrist fast.
Comment 160.4	@Seer Seerwealth <br />this deal won&#39;t pass. Bojo knows that.

Comment161	Brexit means Exit..... And No deal Brexit is best for Blighty.
Comment162	Oh dear, I <b>do</b> hope that those poor hard working dears get paid overtime for this  üò®  and that somebody will go and take care of Jeremy&#39;s allotment.

Comment164	FREE UK FROM SCOTLANDüòÅ
Comment 164.1	Free  Nessie from Scotland ... . üòÇ
Comment165	A deal that not even the Brexiteers want...
Comment 165.1	@Geth Creator Don&#39;t kid yourself, David Cameron will go down in history¬†arguably as the worst PM of the UK who divided the country into 2 halves. And that is before you talk about the economic repercussions of Brexit. When the GDP shrinks, companies begin to relocate out of the UK, unemployment rises, people would wonder why the hell they got themselves into this Brexit BS in the first place.
Comment 165.2	@Alex Fu I do thank David Cameron for the opportunity, only good thing he ever done.<br /><br />The deal can still be voted down and if not a GE will tie things up because the tories have no chance whatsoever of securing a majority with this shit deal
Comment 165.3	@Jacob Jorgenson No doubt about it. They have David Cameron to thank. What a complete train wreck. LOL.
Comment 165.4	üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Comment 165.5	The brexiters loose<br />Remainders loose<br />The UK loose<br />NI loose<br />The EU loose<br /><br />Takes skill to loose that much
Comment166	you need to blow your nose - or give up big macs
Comment167	No Deal. No Referendum. We just leave Now.
Comment 167.1	Please do that and leave Ireland behind.
Comment 167.2	@Z plan Your leave should have a capital L.
Comment 167.3	Put the grace back into typing.leave the caps for chavs
Comment168	FREE ASSANGE
Comment 168.1	@Derreck Jones Free Dom -&gt; Freedom üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø
Comment 168.2	@Evan490BC Free Dom
Comment 168.3	@Ad Lockhorst Oh, now I see... (Silly remark detector ON) üòÜ Yeah, Welsh was too hard for me too, so I decided to learn Klingon instead...
Comment 168.4	@Evan490BC I never let facts get in the way of a silly remark. And as for FREEING WHALES, well, we could have a FREE WALES campaign (a Wexit from the UK) if it wasn&#39;t for their using Welsh which we don&#39;t understand  üòõ
Comment 168.5	@Ad Lockhorst Not at all! You must be a pre-teen. &quot;Free Willy!&quot; was a movie.
Comment169	&quot;Race to the bottom.&quot; Corbyn doesn&#39;t have a very high opinion of the UK if he thinks that&#39;s what will happen if left to our own devices. Quite a telling statement.
Comment 169.1	@Z plan if the government wanted to stop migration they could have...even the migration from the EU by putting limits on the minimum wage they have to earn to be qualified to live in the uk...and making them prove they have enough money to support themselves but the government chose not to do that...even though other EU countries do it...that proves it&#39;s the UK policy to blame for your problems and even if all the EU citizens leave they will just be replaced with people from non eu countries and your situation will not change for the better...I&#39;m not taking out of empathy...just point ing facts...if you don&#39;t like Europeans that&#39;s fine and want them out of the UK that&#39;s fine and your right...but stop pretending it will help you have cheaper rent and higher wages because that&#39;s just not true...
Comment 169.2	They&#39;ll have to pay more, as demand Will outstrip supply.<br />Rents will fall too, without 7 polish per one bedroom flat.<br />Guessing you have a chair polishing non job, unaffected by mass immigration.<br />If so, you could take the opportunity to practice your empathy skills
Comment 169.3	@Z plan Exactly...it&#39;s not the austerity measures that kept wages down...it&#39;s the east Europeans even though migration from EU countries is not even 1/3 of total migration and east Europeans are less than half that...I&#39;m sure the government will double the wages for warehouse , cleaning, catering, construction, agriculture and all the typical jobs east Europeans do in the UK  ..and you and your friends can have you dream job available...
Comment 169.4	That&#39;s what happened to wages with East European immigrants.
Comment170	This deal is not what I voted for, I want no ties to the EU and keep 39 billion for the privilege
Comment 170.1	d15ude I do
Comment 170.2	Who cares what you want ü§£ü§£ü§£

Comment171	Brits out of Ireland.
Comment 171.1	@d drid Thank you brother :)
Comment 171.2	Helo Irish friends from France!! stay strong we love you ( as all europeans do!!) , soon united Ireland!!!!!!!! English go home!!!!!!
Comment 171.3	@Joshua Swallow They are a tiny part of our population and are welcome to stay in our united island but lets not forget they were put here at the cost of Irish lives and deserve no special treatment. Their days of ruling over the rest of the Irish are over.
Comment 171.4	@Joe Bloggs and I don&#39;t view the conquest of Ireland of most of the empires expansion as good
Comment 171.5	‚Äã@Joe Bloggs bit off topic I thought we were talking about how protestant unionists didn&#39;t want to be a part of the republic/free state and why you  think people choosing not to agree with you is unfree
Comment172	Trying to cram through another crappy Brexit deal should go well considering how May&#39;s deal went (oh wait).
Comment 172.1	Parliament should be sued and have to pay all of the people 4 remaining in the EU at the behest of the people.
Comment 172.2	Bore off, beardy weirdy
Comment173	I&#39;m not voting for this deal either
Comment 173.1	Unless you are a MP, you won&#39;t be voting for this deal.
Comment 173.2	@Fonzie well,thats one point of view.
Comment 173.3	@Jonathan White The ones with the biggest gobs always seem to be the remoaners haha
Comment 173.4	@Fonzie yes,all of their constituents not just the ones with the biggest gobbs
Comment174	I can&#39;t believe how bad our parliament been over the last 3 years
Comment 174.1	You could have Nancy Pelosi, AOC, and Omar in Parliament. That would be quite a showdown. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Comment 174.2	Absolutely shameful &quot;
Comment175	I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t see they passing this deal... I would be surprised if they do.
Comment 175.1	@James Dean<br />There is ways he could try and get around it, or he could give and a fight for a general election he&#39;s actually polling to win.
Comment 175.2	@Anonymous Ha I&#39;m not a remainer, I&#39;m just facing the facts. With the Benn Act in place, Johnson has no choice other then seeking an extension if this fails and that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;ll do.
Comment 175.3	@James Dean<br />Nobody wants an extension, the EU themselves are begging you Remainers to back the deal. <br /><br />Your more pro Remain than the actual EU xD Your ridiculous.
Comment 175.4	@James Dean yet another Brextension  üò¥
Comment 175.5	@Anonymous It won&#39;t be no deal if it fails, It will then be an extension.
