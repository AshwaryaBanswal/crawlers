Comment8	Borrow?  if we need to borrow why are we giving away foreign aid to places building nukes?
Comment9	Where is that money tree that the Tories did not exist, sounds like Mrs May did not look hard enough, Mr Johnson seems to have found the money tree.
Comment10	Labour just can&#39;t be trusted to be put in charge of the Nations current account. They&#39;d apply for every credit card going, take out loans left, right &amp; centre and run up an over-draft in next to no time and just spunk all the money on binge spending - leaving the next generation to pay off the debt.
Comment11	Get your facts right, torys in last 10 years have borrowed so much already!!<br />IM VOTING LABOUR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER!!
Comment 11.1	@Dave jay<br /><br />Sorry but I&#39;m not interested in voting for a circular system whereby one party screws the economy up and then another party fixes the screw up and then the previous party comes back in and screws it all up all over again. <br /><br />That&#39;s like voting for a dog that chases its own tail. I chose a continuous stable governance over that flip flop crap any day of the week.
Comment 11.2	@eric lovelace you deluded?? We have had torys last 10 years , what more can they do for you?? Its time for a change a new government. Lets giv labour a chance
Comment 11.3	What, you mean after new Labour blew all the money the last time?
Comment12	Vote for Corbin and die in a gulag.<br />Vote for Boris and get cheated.<br />Vote for whats her name and put up with her whining for the next 5 years.
Comment13	Borrowing really means inflation and<br />Investing really means taxation.<br />ALL TAX IS THEFT.
Comment14	Quite obviously neither had to talk to the HSBC  Indian call centre I had to converse with in an attempt to increase my overdraft limit , apparently  I didnt reach the correct criteria.
Comment15	Just voting green this time. They have all proved what self serving scum  they are ( I didnt vote in the ref  ref ) They can&#39;t be trusted , any of them.
Comment16	Stop talking rubbish it is not unpredictable Tories will win what is unpredictable about that.?
Comment17	If youre going to Brexit, why not get the Commonwealth together as an economic power? We have so much in common, let&#39;s become a thing again.
