Comment1	There is no future partnership between the UK and the EU. The Uk can only start new deals but after the Brexit, the new deals will start with 27 EU countries and what does this mean for Britain? A disaster!.
Comment2	So sad to see democracy dying in uk. They ignored the outcome of votes and deliberately sabotage  brexit and delay it to try to fix the result. All mps should be sacked for standing in way of democracy and they should be fined all wages and pay them back to tax payers for ignoring a democratic vote.
Comment3	The u.k needs to say fuck the eu and just leave fuck democracy this is why communism is better they dont play games they get it done. Its been 3 years and they are still negotiating this is complete bullshit.

Comment7	Halloween Brexit in heaven! Maybe plan B with  Genral Election? After that Brexit without deal or with deal but never a Brexit. Maybe we  should join the EU again?

DRAIN THE SWAMP

Comment22	"33 [ Brexit ]<br />Cała Europa płacze<br />nad brexitem,<br />pytanie, jakie czynności dostosowawcze<br />tego kraju zostały już odbyte.<br />Do pracy po niedobrej<br />stronie dojeżdżają samochodami,<br />nie umieją posłużyć się<br />normalnymi suwmiarkami.<br />O ważeniu w tonach,<br />kilogramach nie ma mowy,<br />nasuwa się stwierdzenie,<br />czy ten kraj do WSTĄPIENIA jest gotowy.<br />Najpierw Anglia musi<br />do normalności się dostosować,<br />a wtedy Unia pomyśli,<br />czy nad przyjęciem wyspy będzie głosować."
Comment23	are they still in??    why???
Comment24	We&#39;ll see the brexit soon...in 2093
Comment25	fantastic NOW WE CAN VOTE THE BREXIT PARTY IN FOR NO DEAL
Comment26	We were conned by Ted Heath in 1973 and so much as admitted it.<br />We never got a vote whether we voted for MEPs in the EU parliament, we were just told to do so or not bother.<br />How DARE the remoaners talk about having another vote!<br />We never got a say on the EU Parliament to start with and EU membership,<br /> only EEC Common Market free trade agreement, which was a lie by Ted <br />Heath.

Comment29	BBC,why don&#39;t you like democracy?
Comment30	If Brexit is cancelled, the public will never forgive them
Comment31	Who would want to be Prime Minister?  No matter what he does, Boris Johnson can not please everybody and nor can any other Prime Minister.<br />That makes the job almost impossible and the job really is like a poisoned chalice.
Comment32	The deal is wurse than last deal.
Comment33	I can’t wait for this to get shot down by Parliament
Comment34	The UK is not making the right decision to leave the EU. I say dust off that old David Cameron deal from 2016 and that keeps the UK in the EU with special considerations and put that to a vote and I guarantee you that will pass every parliament with flying colours.
Comment35	A very cunning move Boris. Get the agreement then we are out because if parliament votes it down the e.u will refuse extension. Then after the the transition we are free and clear.
Comment36	Hi if the British left the e.u and left the part of Ireland they have get re-uninted once again with the rest of Ireland..it would have been a lot easier.
Comment37	Wheres the money going ?
Comment38	This was controlled opposition from start to finish .enjoy the soap show. You are screwed over
Comment39	All liars  cancel your TV licence
Comment40	Well done Boris!
Comment41	Bojo evil viral deal. No No No to Bojo treason deal. No No No to Bojo treason deal.
Comment42	<b>The Student Loans Department has invaded the comment section.</b>
Comment 42.1	YIKES!!!!!
Comment43	Such a failure for UK.
Comment44	Boris&#39;s obstinacy
Comment45	Please leave!!! Leave!!! Finally leave!!! Go out!!!!
Comment46	This is the worst experience of UK and confusing people I am very exciting what is next
Comment47	Leaving the corrupt EU is the best deal ever!!! BREXT 1776!
Comment48	Now is time for parliamentarians to cum together...:) boris u naughty
Comment49	Whatever this is it&#39;s not Brexit .
Comment50	I hope British freedom Inspire and other nations of Europe. My country destroyed by EU. I believe with confidence we must go..
Comment 50.1	Bold and fantastic claim, who do you think will bit it?
Comment51	GO AWAY F- - king English leeches ! Your country worth shit, you eat garbage under the eternal pouring rain, you look like 1936 horses ( yellow teeth included), the only people who wants to stay there after the break ( if any ..lol..) are the third world rats, you are too stupid to drive in the civilized side of the road, what is this f - - ckin thing Royaltea ??? You still have cobwebs all over you fuck retarded. Go back to your kingdom and STAY .. stay .. stay ... and shut up and fuck your queen.  Make yourself invisible to us Europeans. Ugly turds !
Comment52	Boris the slug, the liar,the stooped chameleon,the clown, how on earth did he become PM? He has negotiated a deal to fail and after he utters sincere words of regret when his deal is defeated, he then wants to ignore the legal commitment eliminating a No Deal and plunge us into an extended period of uphill negotiations and downhill prospects for our once respected country.<br />                                                                                                    <br />His self glorification and political ambition he puts ahead of any consideration in improving the lives of those who did not vote for him or even vote for Brexit. His weasel words &#39;taking back control&#39; are meaningless when we will still be subject to Eu regulations. He is a manipulative political chancer with promises as empty as his morals. He is unfit for office ,but I suppose in Borisland he is surrounded by like minded syncopaths.
Comment53	we should not let Junker be there unless he can prove he&#39;s sober
Comment54	A deal means Political Suicide for the Toxic Tories 17,4 million people will NEVER vote for the Tories again. But some good would come out of all this the BREXIT PARTY will get into power for decades to come.
Comment55	ohmygod I cant wait for the British to leave us, just go for fuck sake haaha
Comment56	Is it only me who wonders if the EU are just letting Boris and co THINK they have a good deal when actually they are plotting something which ensures we won&#39;t be leaving?  Just a thought.  All beams and smiles from Barnier and co but there is such a thing as putting on an act,
Comment57	who likes england anyway? outta sight,outta mind !!
Comment58	Sometimes politics looks more interesting than another football match. England is the founder of football, a country where they love and value a vibrant game with an unexpected outcome. Politics on Albion recently also resembled a good match, where the teams were already exhausted enough and were preparing for the final whistle. However, suddenly the staff of Prime Minister Johnson succeeded in the end to achieve success. Now the UK is waiting for a political “penalty shootout.&quot;
Comment59	To say EU said he got the number do not make sense
Comment60	So your telling me boris Johnson listen to Trump is doing so if the EU complain or anything like that we slam EU with TAX I understand but the the fact is it&#39;s really bad for us because everything will go up food clothes so yeah I get what boris is doing yeah he might have May&#39;s deal but he got something up his sleeve
Comment61	If this goes through, you will never escape your Insect Overlords.Fu*k the EU!!!... Fu*k the Insects!!! No Deal Brexit is your only Hope...
Comment62	Why can&#39;t we just be independent  are we now prisoners of the EU or is it our MPs can&#39;t do their job and run a country our country  I agree no hard boarder it&#39;s not needed but it sounds a bit rum for N Ireland to  have different taxes from us. I don&#39;t know. not sure but good that we can trade with other countries  and while I&#39;m happy to deal with the USA. I don&#39;t believe putting our eggs all in one basket  just prudent not too. See what happens I guess.
Comment63	&quot;It&#39;s worse even than Theresa May&#39;s deal, it takes Scotland out of the EU&quot; 🤣🤣<br />Remain lost, Nicci. You lost. It&#39;s for the Brexiteers to decide the deal, not the anti-Brexiteers.
Comment 63.1	@Edric Vaurnheart didnt knew you changed your democratic system, i knew it was a parlament democracy where you chose competent people to make decisions for you because the majority of people are dumb as fuck, brexit is the best example.<br />Referendum was the fascists prefered tool, once you fooled the fools you no longer need to face smart reasonable people in parlament, you just make the sheeps vote for it
Comment 63.2	@Fingers You &#39;definetly&#39; won&#39;t answer the question because you know the answer, and that it defies the democratic will of the British people.
Comment 63.3	@Edric Vaurnheart definetly i dont want people like you anywhere near me 🤣
Comment 63.4	@Fingers Spelling 😂 Though surely you can agree the only deal that remain would be content with is one that keeps us in the EU?
Comment 63.5	You wrote such a silly comment yet is it edited, the first version must be something worth reading.
Comment64	Islamic Republic of united terror kingdom is in the making... In near future enitre Jehadi Terror outfits Will be from Englandisthan.. Radicalised Queen might be converted to Jehadi Islam.. Day is very near England will be pakistan😂😂😂😂

Comment68	The YooKai went into turmoiiiil
Comment69	backstop was never an issue and always a diversion tactic. Now they are playing their card. Ooh look, rmeain without the backstop, yay, great /sigh. Brexit is leave is No Deal or a pure trade agreement
Comment70	Another WA instead of a trade agreement. Disgusting lies. This is not Brexit! Good on the DUP!
Comment71	Treaty not a deal. Bad for the UK.
Comment72	Boris the dealer!
Comment73	Fuck the treaty what a stitch up
Comment74	Yeah, stop speaking in English with your hyperthetical rhetoric, that&#39;s something else that needed to be regulated.
Comment75	Well, we&#39;ll see..... I am very skeptical that this deal will do the trick.......
Comment76	This Brexit is became really a big Plutocracy, ignorant and stupid<br />agony that Brexsheeters are doing and promoting. It is a completely an UK<br />politicians mess that it make me think that they will drive peoples of UK into<br />a schizophrenic nation with all those controversy and diversity. Now is no<br />doubt who is tearing peoples of UK apart. Toxic people will not be changed by<br />the alchemy of your kindness. Yes, be kind, but move on swiftly and let life be<br />their educator. Unfortunately the most who will suffer here are UK citizens.<br />Just make all of us EU citizens an favor and put a dynamite up in your ass and<br />light it on. (Farrage, Boris, Rees-Mogg, Tice etc.)
Comment77	I HATE politicians.....
Comment78	£33 billion and we remain until 2020??????  what a fantastic deal...…..For the EU parliament.....And a sick joke for 17.4 million English citizen`s. HA HA HA.
Comment79	England I am coming for u all up to the royal faimly I have proof you set English with net work
Comment80	junkcer comes across as old and grumpy. what&#39;s old and grumpy in luxembourgish?
Comment81	Beloved Boris shafted UK NATION doggie style! Wall done Blondie.
Comment82	It doesn&#39;t seem to have occurred to anyone in Parliament (or the people when they voted) that having declared that they will leave the EU, they have already indicated bad faith and broken a contract.   The choice of a deadline isn&#39;t theirs anymore, but the EUs.  The EU could easily completely cut off trade with Britain at no net cost to it.  The UK needs trade with the EU more than it does.   That it wasn&#39;t summarily thrown out is only because it is to the advantage of the other EU nations to watch the UK shoot itself in its own foot and further weaken its trade position.  <br /><br /><br />Arguably Britain&#39;s membership has provided stability, or rather inertia, that has prevented the EU from becoming more self-reliant, because of its no longer relevant historic relationship with the US, which shows every indication of bailing out of NATO under the current President.   GB has been a net beneficiary of the EU because its other member provide much greater  physical, military and economic  barriers between it, Russian and China than GB could provide on its own, and the cost is purely economic.<br /> <br />IMO you are going to see what&#39;s left of the British Empire disintegrate and further degenerate,  probably before the next  Monarch&#39;s coronation, and the conditions established for either WW3 or the UK&#39;s Mad Maximilian After Brexit.
Comment83	Why UK have to pay 33b£ ? Are you joking?
Comment84	THE DEAL NOW SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UK AND PUT TO A REFERENDUM, NOT TO A BUNCH OF INEFFICIENT CORRUPT RICH FOLK WHO ONLY HAVE THEIR OWN INTERESTS AT HEART
Comment 84.1	@K H Yes but that was to &quot;Stay or Leave&quot;!! Now you and the masses should have a say on the logistical process and be made aware of the complications to your own personal lives if there is any.. (like going on holiday to mainland Europe?????) In other words, the agreement should be put through the door of every household for people to vote on it. There is not one politician in the world that is in their position for the people on the street. We are all mere tax collecting idiots!! letting them away with blatant robbery every second of every day. Fair play to all the protestors rioting across the globe at this present time. About time the people of the UK really stood up for themselves again as they did with the poll tax riots (that was the last time)... We are all being Passively  Aggressively controlled in whats supposed to be an area of free speech and movement. Its blatant bullshit in my opinion.
Comment 84.2	We have already had one they need to follow through
Comment85	It is 90% the same as the May deal there`s not much new about it, what is new is the fact that 10% makes it much worse than the May Deal.
Comment86	I see the PM said that he has a New Brexit<br />Deal with the EU.If I am correct the House<br />of Commons will be sitting this Saturday,<br />to take a vote on the Deal.<br />My personal opinion is that the Deal will<br />not be accepted  in the House.This being<br />the case,the UK as agreed with the EU will<br />leave the EU on 31st October,2019 with<br />No Deal.<br />I one might say,(WE ARE ALL GOING<br />DOWN THE SWANNY).<br />There is another saying:-,Britain Rules the<br />Waves.We do not rule anything anymore.<br />There will be CHAOS and we will be<br />entering ARMAGEDDON in the UK.<br />When will we ever learn.<br />Aaaa-Men,Aaaa-Men,Aaaa-Men.
Comment 86.1	The Benn Act should never had happened.<br />The UK Government and the EU AGREED to<br />leave on the 31st October.The Benn Act is <br />an is an Infridgement to this Agreement<br />and therefore it is UNLAWFUL.<br />When will we ever learn.
Comment 86.2	You forgot about something called &quot;The Benn Act&quot;, ignoring it will not make it go away.
Comment87	J Junker&#39;s face looks like a Bollocks skin
Comment 87.1	@Pablo Jay including you perhaps
Comment 87.2	@Pablo Jay The latter&#39;s are ruddier.
Comment 87.3	Same face every grumpy racist old brexiter has then.
Comment88	The &#39;Boris Deal&#39; is a Mega Sham !
Comment 88.1	Boris the Borg!
Comment 88.2	"NEW EU -UK TREATY (nefarious pact by Johnson to his boss JUNKER) sends UK nation to slavery of the EU and just a colony of EU EMPIRE.<br />No ifs or buts about that.<br />If <b>DUP</b> agrees they are truly done and duped. <br /><br />BIG VIKING YELL we *NEVER SURRENDER*, TODAY turned out to be just a whimper of BLONDIE boy. UK CAPITULATED, &quot;outsmarted&quot; itself and SOLD OUT, under strong-arm pressure to EU EMPIRE. All this ongoing charade, pantomime, as is ongoing today, is just a big TOP CIRCUS show to b.s. aimed at the UK population. <br /><br /> As predicted Boris became a modern CHAMBERLAIN today on 17th October 2019 as predicted weeks ago, waving a useless piece of SURRENDER paper in front of UK population like a carrot in front of ~DONKEY~. <br /> UK NATION has been on 17th OCTOBER 2019 SOLD-OUT by BORIS, boastful &quot;YELLER&quot; *********we NEVER SURRENDER*******! <br />What a joke. <br />UK will break up now, within 3-5 years. <br />England, colony; <br />Wales, colony; <br />SCOTLAND -fishless Bravehearts, but full of haggis; <br /><br />Northern IRELAND joined with IRELAND as one UNITED IRELAND territory, ruled, under EU representative THE EMPEROR VARADKAR. <br /><br />ENGLAND, the colony of the EU Empire, will split to individual counties. <br />EASIER managed by EU EMPIRE army. <br /><br />No bombs succeeded. <br />But then we had Winston CHURCHILL, not BORIS at helm. <br /><br />We need to see that ditch Boris you promised us.

Comment89	UK government been punked.... And forcing MPs to back a deal they rejected 3 Times.... EU = 4th R
Comment 89.1	It is even worse.....
Comment90	Brexit is a PARADISE LOST. Can the Eu expel the Uk in order to protect businesses and citizens 😴😴
Comment 90.1	&quot; Paradise &quot; ??! .. LoL ... Your kingdom it&#39;s a dump ... Yes yes expel the leeches !
Comment91	For your information. Aldi currently has a very smooth Chilean Pinot Noir at only £3-99p. No reason yet to go back to buying French wine. And recently Aldi has been selling goat&#39;s cheese from Wales, at approximately the same cost per kgm., as the French stuff.
Comment92	Let us now move onto the long-standing problem of the war reparations that Germany failed to pay.
Comment 92.1	Germany will  pay just as soon as you lot pay Ireland   for yours

Comment95	Boris the blagger. Treachery at the highest. Blatant disregard for the people he represents.<br />I will never trust another MP as long as I live.<br />Liars, paid liars.
Comment96	Johnson, speaking on the UK’s long relationship with Europe, suggests that Britain had never been truly European but &#39;always half in, half out&#39;....according to the map we are still in and have been for some considerable time. Someone ought to tell him.
Comment97	It&#39;s 95% May&#39;s deal it&#39;s not a new deal at all, no wonder the EU is happy with it.
Comment 97.1	what are you talking about hahaha. The EU do not give a fuck, even if its no deal. UK is the one whos trieng so hard
Comment98	except there is no financial deal regarding imports and exports... So still no real deal.<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no deal &lt;&lt;&lt; <br /><br />Just yet more conservative party magical realism...
Comment99	Fk corbyn
Comment 99.1	Fuck your shagged out extreme right wing con trick.
Comment100	Scotland is the victim country from this deal .  The English have apparently utter contempt for the Scottish nation. They treat it like some 19th century colony . The English only create disgust among the Scots in the shabby treatment they have recieved from an English prime minister . I suppose the English have this belief in their superioty rather like the NAZIs had towards other races !
Comment 100.1	@Alan Marr 🤣 I believe in people seeking their freedom by any means. No country has obtained its freedom from the English without violent revolution .High time the Scottish people woke up
Comment 100.2	@pat dunne So you believe in inciting violence. That is a criminal offence and you  are a criminal  as such. I hope the authorities are taking note..<br />People like you are causing crime and should be imprisoned !
Comment 100.3	What are the Scottish sheep doing then ? Why are there not hundreds of thousands of people on the street demanding your freedom . Why are you not planning  a violent uprising against the English  . A country never achieved its freedom by  behaving like scolded sheep.
Comment 100.4	UK population over 63 million. Vote for advising the government to vote in our representative democracy 17.4 million. The responsibility of all our national governments is to represent the interests of the entire population. brexit was funded to crash the pound. That is not in all our interests.
Comment101	Boris: I have a new deal<br /><br />Parliament: Nope.....
Comment102	Crisis
Comment103	Crysis
Comment104	Will it run crysis?
Comment105	I am waiting for tomorrow biggest show .
Comment106	We want a clean break no ties like when you leave a violent partner. We d really like to take out an injunction against the Eu
Comment107	Brexit now !
Comment108	He’s taken a leaf out of Trumps book, everything’s “great” and he barely used a word with more than one syllable. What happened to us?
Comment 108.1	We have overcome our ego. The bigest words and most articulate speakers doesnt equate to brilliants. Just car salesmen
Comment 108.2	It started happening around 1910, but no one nothiced.
Comment109	But we the majority never voted for a deal
Comment110	UK falls
Comment111	No ones read it yet Stop saying they’ve struck a deal they haven’t we just pay them a massive amount of money to stay in again. No deal should mean no money
Comment112	And they still get to rape OUR seas of OUR fish.....!  Kick this nonsense &#39;deal&#39; out of parliament.....
Comment113	The only difference between May&#39;s deal and Boris&#39; is the English knife in the back of the Ulster Unionists. The conservatives are now just an English nationalist party.
Comment114	The usual nonsense coming from Commissar Corbyn. While he is the leader of the Labour party, they will never get into power in the UK as people, even traditional Labour voters, realise he is the puppet of the extreme left wing that has grasped control of the Labour movement.
Comment115	Let&#39;s hope those traitorous brexiteer MPs don&#39;t block this and keep the UK in the undemocratic EU dictatorship. We know who they are IDS, Bridgen, Evans, Bone, Redwood forget the DUP and vote for BOJOs new May deal.
Comment116	Looks bad on labour/London, a few weeks ago they were crying that PM was forcing a no-deal and was not serious about getting a deal, now the PM has got a deal, ( the only deal EU can do ) and now labour/London is crying that the deal is not good enough so will try to prevent Brexit.
Comment 116.1	@Gabriel Kelly yeah we all knew that before the referendum, it&#39;ll get sorted, the UK will be better and to get rid of guy verhofstadt and the other EU slimeballs, 2-5 years disruption is justified
Comment 116.2	@nio england even if this WA gets through the House of Commons tomorrow, the actual Brexit negotiations will only start on Nov 1st. The last few years have just been for Phase 1, the next Phase will be the more difficult aspects to negotiate  - future trading arrangements,  people&#39;s rights and movement, security, etc..Brexit will be with us for at least 2 more years once the Withdrawal Phase is sorted out.
Comment 116.3	@Gabriel Kelly Thats a shame cos it&#39;d be good to get on with things now instead of bothering with more Brexit
Comment 116.4	@nio england well the DUP do not care about jobs or even what the NI people think. They care about the Union and their position in it. The DUP have said many times that they would rather see no Brexit at all than a deal that would weaken the Union - they will not support this deal tomorrow in the HoC.
Comment 116.5	@Gabriel Kelly There&#39;d be extra jobs at the ports though

Comment119	Let’s be brutally frank here! This deal is basically Theresa May’s Deal Or Treaty, dressed up to look a bit different! This deal has sold the REAL concept of BREXIT down the river! For a few trite &amp; non-consequential concessions in the Irish border-Trade situation, we ( The British People) have been skillfully maneuvered &amp; stuck into a corner here, because the real issues of Parliamentary Sovereignty, independent Foreign &amp; Defence Policy, Independence In Negotiating Free Trade Deals with other countries, Independent UK Fisheries &amp; Territorial-Waters Control, Taxation, Freedom &amp; Independence From EU Laws, Standards &amp; Jurisprudence has been disregarded &amp; totally ignored in these dealings. Indeed, they were cleverly set aside &amp; have not been properly examined under scrutiny by the public, the media or the so-called Political Class nor focused upon or publicly debated outside of Parliament, the EU Council, the UK Government!! THESE BREXIT ISSUES HAVE ALL BEEN SHAMEFULLY YIELDED &amp; CONCEDED BY THE UK TO THE EU IN THIS SELL-OUT DEAL OR NEW EU-UK TREATY here by Boris &amp; his Dupes or Cronies!! For the UK 🇬🇧 This is Slavery under a Cunning Disguise! It’s Sheer Sophistry to State otherwise!

Comment 131.1	Roel 1971 <br />Takes one to know one🐵
Comment132	<b>**But lets see if parliament agree it**</b> My guess the LABOUR and LIB DEM idiots would prefer to tumble down the rabbit hole into darkness and into doubt because its not the deal they want! Well lets be clear! There is NO DEAL which LIB DEM or LABOUR could negotiate at this point which would better MR Johnsons proposals or one which Europe would agree to. Its taken months of tough, hard and relentless negotiations between some of the most serious minds on the planet to get this agreement in place. What are these apposing party&#39;s smoking that makes them think they can do better??? EUROPE are as sick of us right now as we are of them and want this done, their not about to roll over and entertain more incessant deliberating! - I don&#39;t see how opposing this on Saturday would do anyone any favours whatsoever! other then plummet the whole country into depression, frustration and sickness in not achieving what it set out to-do. These people need to rally behind Boris and this see done for the people and for the country to move forward! That&#39;s the only sensible play here and it would be sheer MADNESS to delay this any further!<br /><br />I hope the SUN crucifies anyone who apposes this DEAL on SAT. They should not even be aloud to be MP&#39;s if they cant conform to the will of a nation!
Comment 132.1	This is nothing less than a surrender &#39;deal&#39; by Johnson the Johnson, and the traitory party...... An asset strippers charter for GERMany..

Comment140	Can we please bring a end to this misery and leave midnight 31st on No deal ....and just get on with our lives a fresh start ...I dont even care if I have to suffer hardship anymore ..I just want this debacle to end ...I cant see any future carrying on like this ...the vote was to LEAVE !!!!!!!
Comment 140.1	@Nigel Moth even if the remainers in the HoC supported the government,  The UK still would not have got a better deal from the EU than the deal May got ( BoJo&#39;s deal is worse). The UK governments have also always given too much power and say to the DUP - the DUP have refused to meet with NI farmers &amp; businesses but they sat down with loyalist paramilitary leaders last week -  you couldnt make it up really.<br />The UK border on the island of Ireland was always going to cause hassle for Brexit - the only land border that the UK would have with the EU after Brexit.  I am sure down the line people will look back at the backstop and ask why wasn&#39;t this approach taken for this was the easy way out - a NI backstop would have resolved it. The UK should already be sitting around the table with the EU negotiating Brexit ( transition phase), instead they are still stuck in the Withdrawal phase with no end in sight. This phase was supposed to be the easy part before the next phase which would look at future trading arrangements,  security, etc..
Comment 140.2	The thing is I feel just the opposite to you ...I blame the remainers for the mess we are in now if they had excepted defeat and moved on positively working on behalf of majority it would have given more stability to employees and employers alike as for the old people and pension pot ...well I&#39;m not sure about that either   I know of many middle aged families that want out ..
Comment 140.3	@Nigel Moth actually the Tories and leave voters have screwed it over already. Three years of almost no investment has crippled many areas of construction. 500 jobs going in a little rural community near me soon... The damage caused to working people by the leave vote is already happening. No skin off their noses tho, mostly boomers and oaps with their noses in the pension trough already.
Comment 140.4	@stoufer2000 are you going to lose your job if we leave without a deal?
Comment 140.5	Thanks bit I&#39;d rather keep my job

Comment144	Johnson is a rat by selling out our union with Northern Ireland.
Comment 144.1	@A.I Abs Apology accepted, Glad to hear that you support the Palestinian cause.
Comment 144.2	JC JC And G  Kelly. First of all, I want to apologise to all Irish citizens and all freedom loving people. <br />Am very sorry for my comments. I was only messing with you but its was wrong and a act of aggression. Who am I to deny another nation’s right to self determination for it’s people. Please take my apologise for earlier posting regarding Northern Ireland and its sovereignty. I had no right say what I have said. All the best to your independents. once again am sorry as a English man. I support Sinn Féin’s Palestinian policy on the independents of the Palestinians. So please forgive give me all my aggression and luck of understanding your problem. I will remove my posting.
Comment 144.3	@A.I Abs There is no dream but your own and the continuing dream of you and other Unionists that you are a part of the UK, You are NOT, all that you are, are the remnants of the plantation of the Six Counties of by Little England. You have been allowed to be deluded, that The UK care&#39;s one iota for your bigoted drum beating sectarian brand of Patriotism. The UK needed the support of the DUP, to prop up the death throes of another corrupt Tory Government, the vast majority of little England&#39;s joe public does not want a return to them being faced with any further military involvement in Ireland, they are sick and tired with pouring financial aid into (what they see) as Ireland. You are fast becoming a minority in the Six Counties, I suggest you, for your own good either accept or move lock stock and barrel to whence you came from. This latest acceptance by the Tory Government of closer alignment for NI with the EU must tell you something. The apologies for Bloody Sunday in Derry, by David Cameron some years ago, and the prosecution of one of their own hired killers from the parachute regiment, must point you all in the direction of where your misplaced faith in Brittania is inevitably leading. YOUR, NO SURRENDER RHETORIC IS OVER.
Comment 144.4	@A.I Abs well to be fair a border poll is looking more and more likely. The GFA allows for such a vote to occur. If you are relying on the UK politicians to stop this from happening then just look at their track record with Brexit. Even BoJo stood up at a DUP Conference and promised that he would never put a border down the Irish sea....yesterday his deal with the EU put a border down the Irish sea.<br />The actions of the DUP have brought forward the chances of the border poll happening a lot sooner than anyone could have expected. But getting a border poll and winning a border poll are two very different things. Even if the people in NI vote for reunification it still needs a similar positive vote in the Republic and that is far from guaranteed, in fact I would be shocked if the Republic voted in favour of a united Ireland but that is just my reading of the situation.
Comment145	Seen from Belgium, the EU has negotiated more with opposition MPs than with Mr Johnson. The EU seems very confident that the opposition will ask for a referendum on whether or not the people accept the agreement reached.<br />And if the media scared the British as they scared the Europeans who spend too much time in front of their television, it is a foregone conclusion for the EU.
Comment 145.1	The English will vote in even greater numbers  to exit next time . If there is another referendum it needs to be in conjunction with a referendum on Scottish independence in Scotland and a border poll in Ireland .
Comment146	Please  please please just let us vote again. The original vote was so close it should have triggered a &#39;re do anyway
Comment 146.1	@Nigel Thomas I&#39;m Irish, doesn&#39;t bother me in the slightest ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Comment 146.2	@Anto64w over a million votes,get over it
Comment 146.3	That&#39;s not how votes work
Comment147	38 billion no wonder they are smiling
Comment148	Labour and Lib Dems will continue to play party politics and vote it down to score points with the remain electorate.<br /><br />Then it&#39;s no deal and it&#39;ll be those parties hated for it. Go ahead and commit political suicide I say lol
Comment149	I cant take this seriously its full of cringey bias
Comment 149.1	Watch it somewhere else. It&#39;s the same Tory disaster zone..
Comment150	If the British politicians refuse the deal agreed by the EU that means By default UK will leave with No Deal.

Comment 163.4	@Frankly Frank They don&#39;t care about European unity so be it. As long as EU milks them for the single market acces, as it should be. I mean Switzerland is literally completely surrounded by the EU. Every single thing in their lives depends of the EU. Also Norway, Iceland, and we see even UK would be lost without cooperation with EU. Funny how Iceland wanted to join the EU when their economy was in serious and big trouble cause of world economic crisis 2008. Sleazy selfish fucks. When everything is a OK then &quot;fuck European unity&quot;, right? When it&#39;s crisis then &quot;Oh EU please let me in and save me!&quot;. I don&#39;t like that type of people. You need to be honest and dedicated to the idea of EU and European unity regardless of your economic situation.

Comment 171.1	@Thor Jørgensen it was law for Boris Johnson to ask for an extension. Don&#39;t know much about politics do you. Know yoir facts before commenting dick head. He didn&#39;t want to ask for one hence why he didn&#39;t sign the letter in the first place.
Comment 171.2	Wtf? It&#39;s the UK who&#39;ve had the oppotunity to leave for three years but haven&#39;t and have kept begging and pleading the EU for extending the deadline. <br />Now the EU is refusing to extend the deadline,  and you still complain? The EU is effectively kicking the UK out at this point for fuck&#39;s sake.

Comment178	And in other BBC. News scientists have found a green blob with no brain that has ‘nearly 720 sexes.’ I don’t know how anything can ‘nearly’ have a sex, but with nearly 720 sexes, I do know that LGBTQLMNXO are going to have a field day and it proves the existence of politicians and BBC journalists.
Comment179	Question: Is Boris the cousin of Trump?<br />Anwser: No.<br />Question: Are you sure? Are you really sure?
Comment180	The deal has nothing to do with America. Surely Corbyn has a better argument then that. EU will eventually want to make good trade deals with UK that benefit everyone as the corporations will push for that.
Comment 180.1	@Clown Around Actually it isn&#39;t unrealistic, since they would hurt the UK a lot more than they would the EU (bigger market). And I am not talking about punishing deals, I am talking about no deals whatsover. Currently less than 10% of all UK trading partners have agreed to roll out the current trade deals for the UK. The other 90% have said they will wait to see if the UK leaves on no deal. And then they can always wait a few years. A normal trade deal takes 5+ years of negotiation on average. If you think the EU would offer the UK the same terms as during their membership, you are delusional. They will offer them worse terms, and so would every other country that has a trade deal with the EU, which is like 60 countries..<br />The UK is losing leverage by leaving a market of 500 million to be a divided market with weakened currency of 60 million. Lets not kid ourselves, nobody other than small countries like Switzerland would offer the same deal to the UK as they do to the EU...<br /><br /><br />There is also the political point of this. If the UK starts losing money and it&#39;s GDP starts decreasing, then this would score political points for the EU. And it would strenghten the belief in the EU for countries that are EU-sceptic (like Italy and Hungary). The EU has an interest to make the UK bleed a bit, to stop other countries from following their lead. If you think business losing money is enough to get the UK great deals, you haven&#39;t been paying attention. For a few years, Brexiters spouted nonsense about German car makers going to Merkel and forcing her to offer a good deal to the UK, as we now know, this didn&#39;t happen. The German car makers stood by the EU, even in the face of financial losses. The EU is ready to sacrifice revenue for its own stability, and this should be clear by now...
Comment 180.2	@alen40to they are to begin negotiations November 4th. Eventually will be asap, they have one year before existing agreements lapse. Businesses will demand logical trade arrangements. What do you think is going to happen. Punishing trade deals that hurt businesses? That&#39;s so unrealistic as such deals benefit no one.
Comment 180.3	Eventually? What is eventually? In 5 years? In 10 years? 55% of trade of the UK is with the EU. The other 45% are mostly covered through trade deals that are by the EU. Meaning that something like 80% of UK trade will be on WTO terms... But &quot;Eventually&quot; they will  get better, lets just hope the kingdom exists as it does now, by that time.
Comment181	Billy Corbyn stretching the imagination, scrabbling for reason to continue holding uk democracy’s head under water along with fellow pro dictatorship comrade Swinson
Comment182	It must be a NO DEAL if the UK once more says no. This must end.
Comment 182.1	A deal it will be, one way or another. They may crash out, but eventually need to deal with the EU countries in anyway. The British industry,regardless branch, is owned and managed by non British corporations to a large extent.
Comment183	Brexit wont happen afraid it kills UK !
Comment184	Its not brexit,...but it might have to do! Jo swinston is a traitor of democracy! corybn a clown...SIR NIGEL is about to enter the house of parliament and given time will become PM
Comment 184.1	The labour and Lib Dem are anti democratic parties they have gone against the will of the people ! You want another vote which is a dictatorship! Anti democratic attitudes should be put in prison ! Disgrace and in my eyes against the will of the countries biggest every democratic vote
Comment 184.2	Do you really think Nigel is going away ! This is not brexit ! It will make him stronger
Comment 184.3	@alan howarth What do you have against communist? If they are democratic, then there is nothing wrong with them.
Comment 184.4	Sir Nigel will be PM with the next 6 years . Labour alib dem are the thing of the past ! And anti democratic parties !!  To be honest no better then communists
Comment 184.5	Farage is the worst of them all. Glad we are rid of him at last.

Comment187	I say Boris is an amazing negotiator! 🤣 Cummings does look depressed.  I love it!
Comment188	Yet again we are in exactly the same situation. Being bullied into accepting a bad deal or threatened with no deal. Strange though that the media seem to keep ignoring the Benn act. Seems like they’re falling right into the trap that’s been set by this minority government - can only hope parliament doesn’t give in to these bully boy tactics.
Comment 188.1	Or are you just frustrated, that all the bullying by GB did not work this time. You were verry successfull with bullying in the past, but this times are over, EU won&#39;t have it anymore.
Comment 188.2	You are not bullied to do anything. YOU wanted to leave and ANY deal is a concession of the EU to you. No Deal is the default of exiting the EU. YOU knew that before the refetendum, so stop whining now.

Comment 190.1	Existing financial commitments, it won&#39;t be paid in a lump sum, rather instalments in decreasing value, likely over the next few decades.
Comment191	All the remoaners who who cried for months saying that the EU would not change its stance on the back stop. Defeatist cowards
Comment 191.1	"@Derreck Jones <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/how-is-boris-johnson-brexit-deal-different-from-theresa-may"">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/how-is-boris-johnson-brexit-deal-different-from-theresa-may</a><br /><br />Sorry it doesn&#39;t come from The Sun.  😁<br />&quot;If the vote is negative, then the regulatory uncoupling will not happen for a further two years: 1 January 2027. During this two-year period the EU will work out how to protect the single market, ie another backstop.&quot; Who&#39;s an ass now, not looking at the detail ? 😂"
Comment 191.2	@lcdat Look at the detail instead of being an ass. Even though there will be a customs border down the Irish sea this deal has done the impossible because on the one hand N.Ireland still falls under UK customs territory and yet at the same time falls within the customs EU union for trading purposes. All this means to me and you is that for goods coming to and from N. Ireland to the UK yes there will be checks. May&#39;s deal on the other hand meant that The whole of the UK (including N.Ireland) were trapped in a customs union until such time as the back stop could be removed which only the EU could decide(which could have been forever).  A massive massive difference. Furthermore, every 4 years the people of N.Ireland can vote on whether they want to keep within that arrangement or fall back into the UK wide customs union. I simply have no idea where you get your 7 years from. You&#39;re making it up as you go along
Comment 191.3	Derreck Jones rather than insulting me, perhaps you’d like to consider that there will be a border between Great Britain and NI, which the backstop did not require.  Not quite taking back control, is it?  If you don’t see that, I am not sure what you are. And by the way, it would take 7 years for Stormont to disentangle NI from the agreement should it be passed.  Within that timeframe there would either be an EU-UK trade deal or the very issues that justified the backstop would come back to haunt you!  Inform yourself, please...
Comment 191.4	@lcdat Absolute tosh. The backstop would have handed the EU full control as to when and if ever the back stop would carry on in perpetuity. The new mechanism involves Stormont giving their consent every 4 years. A massive difference and if you cannot see that then you&#39;re an idiot.
Comment 191.5	Derreck Jones the backstop would have avoided splitting NI from mainland U.K. from a border checks and regulatory perspective.  Boris did indeed sell to the EU what the EU could not sell to Theresa because she (and the DUP) wouldn’t have it.  Do you see the irony? Boris got nothing out of the negotiation that the EU was not prepared to give out in the first place. The U.K. was totally outflanked throughout the negotiations because some issues are intractable and the Leavers never had any plan or understanding of power dynamics.
Comment192	What if you don&#39;t want to leave??
Comment193	I only saw the introduction to what the deal is.....RUBBISH !!
Comment194	Hat&#39;s off for British people&#39;s for self immolation (BREXIT), now world became multipolar, agree or don&#39;t agree that but it&#39;s fact, don&#39;t isolated from world, we are on 21th century, world talking about colony&#39;s in MARS or MOON will you do the same there.

Comment196	Germany 🇩🇪 should get biggest cut of this £33bn bag 💼 of goodies rt? 💪🤑👍
Comment 196.1	That&#39;s not how it works I&#39;m afraid.
Comment197	Any reasonable family man in he UK should support this deal and BoJo. The divorce bill to be paid, although it was characterized as a fine by some morons in the past, it is just money that are already agreed to be put in the UK economy in infrastructure from the EU the following years so nothing wrong there. BoJo gives to the majority of the people full control of immigration and legislation of their country without  any inhibitions for the economy with just leaving out of this the 1.8 mill people of NI who by majority voted to stay in the EU anyway. This is a win for the UK and the morons of the house of commons should support it.
Comment 197.1	Well nice for Northern Ireland. but the DUP doesn´t agree :P<br />And Scotland want the same deal then too.<br />It seems that deal cut UK down to 3 kingdoms. might as well cut it down to 2 kingdoms. wait WHAT ... how about just don´t ... and stay 4 kingdoms.

Comment205	As a Brit myself i hope we stay in the EU <br />🇬🇧🇪🇺
Comment 205.1	@PG trojka So be glad the EU government is tossing away every 3 month BS referendums. that is a waste of tax payers money, and full of racist and xenophobic votes of the sheeps. <br />Like the Netherlands voted out of the EU same as Ireland. and boy did were the sheeps uneducated.
Comment 205.2	@PG trojka We didn´t want Ukraine and Poland in the netherlands or UK to join the EU. <br />Oh wait you didn´t know that, the government tossed away the referenrum.
Comment 205.3	@Drake Hound What are you talking about? What referendum about eastern Europe wasn&#39;t respected??? I am not familiar with it. The only two referendums that were disrespected in modern history of Europe are Irish and now this Brexit thing. And the main people trying to disrespect it are Lib Dem crypto fascists like yourself. 🤗🤗🤗😆😆😆 Too bad that you are not powerful enough to do it this time around though. :) Enjoy your independence few days from now. Oh and stop causing instability in your own country.
Comment 205.4	@PG trojka LOL well if referenrum must be respected. you east european countries would have never be allowed to join the EU. <br />Oh drat suddenly democracy doesn´t seem so nice when it works against you.
Comment 205.5	Come on dude, respect the democracy and referendum. I say it as continental European. Referendum must be respected. Even if UK would somehow remain in the EU it would be a member that is always on a verge of leaving. (like it always was esentially, lol)

Comment207	They give Johnson A PIG IN A POKE and laugh their heads off as he walks away with it bleating on about the great deal he got. What betrayal, what treachery, what a joke you are Johnson.
Comment 207.1	Not just Boris ...
Comment208	It is nothing short of astonishing that the English electorate are still stupid enough to vote for right wing parties
Comment 208.1	@Kishore S No..they were stupid enough to believe that silly catchphrase. Which is obvious when the EU have had no involvement in the uk parliamentary process since the referendum
Comment 208.2	@jak jak Well not really. It&#39;s totally irrelevant
Comment 208.3	@Kishore S  When did they ever have control of their country . Ogh right 1918 when their &quot;betters&quot; were telling them to charge at machine guns. 🤣<br />The stupidity and serfdom  has been bred  into them
Comment 208.4	Kishore S agreed.. the biggest joke is that even a right wing party like the conservatives are actually incredibly left when you compare them to the politics of the world.. the uk is far more left leaning in general, but people also want the human right to vote and have the result honoured and those they vote in to be accountable to them.. it’s as if they value and importance of democracy has been forgotten by so many people over a generation or two
Comment 208.5	Lol they aren&#39;t stupid they are intelligent they want to take control of their country unlike liberals like you who hate their country
Comment209	Jeremy corbyn i Will help you pack your bags no problem😁🦍🍌

Really the Remainer&#39;s ..SNP..Labour and Liberal &quot;Democrats&quot;  behaved like Uk Traitors (EU Loyalists)against the Democratic Vote of the People..<br />hampered and undercut  the negotiations and it hopefully will not hurt a most beloved neighbor. I am hurt to see this clip here."
Comment 210.1	@pat dunne it is difficult when the Media and mps are so biased instead of presenting facts...
Comment 210.2	@merseybeat1963  44% Leave , 55.8% remain , and 38% of the electorate could not be arsed either way . Perhaps they are the wisest ones
Comment 210.3	@pat dunne Vast majority.. 55% wasnt it
Comment 210.4	The vast majority of people in N Ireland wish to remain in EU .The DUP / Nazis  represent  only themselves
Comment211	The brits all disoriented...
Comment212	Well done Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Comment 212.1	@Stephen Porter Very True.Well said.
Comment 212.2	@Thor Jørgensen I agree with you 100 percent.
Comment 212.3	@Thor Jørgensen If you want to chuck us out that opinion would be welcome , but you dont live here or understand why it was voted.  Certainly wouldnt get your info from the BBC
Comment 212.4	​@rick Woods So only Brits can debate whether or not you&#39;ve taken too long to make a decision of whether you want a deal or when you want to leave? That is just pure nonsense.<br />Everyone in the world has the right to give their opinion on whether or not this entire episode is a load of horse shit. And you know what? I think it is.<br />A storm in a glass of water.<br />Are you also going to lecture people of how only English people are allowed to give their opinion and how Welsh, Scots, and Overseas Territories have no privilege to discuss their opinion either? Get off your high horse.
Comment213	its&#39; so cool with UK and EU.  Do you think the same ?
Comment214	Well done Boris. Now Corbyn will see if he can destroy all the good work.
Comment215	WOW! 😳 What an unimaginable cluster fuck!
Comment216	I absolutely love Boris, I was so excited last night to hear about the new Brexit deal, it was being reported on every Australian news channel. The Australian dollar shot up like a bullet because Australia is one of the first countries the UK will sign a big beautiful trade deal with independent of the HORRIBLE EVIL EU. 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Comment217	Every single income household should be afraid of this. Many of the poor or the elderly cannot survive what Boris is proposing.
Comment218	1.8 million kids going hungry and Boris produces a deal that would make every household £40 a week worse off.  A blatant attempt to screw over both leavers and remainers - but not his rich Tory hedge fund backers.
Comment219	Seems UK has the same contentions from the Democrats on the left as America. Your independence should be utmost in your mind. Thrive together or die together. Nobody else cares about the UK other than the UK. Same for USA. We’ve given a large swath of our economy away to China and we are pulling teeth just to get back business that should have always been apart of our own nations economy. The longer you wait to fight this battle, the harder the fight will be. Fight now, not later.
Comment 219.1	Dude if Corporation is coming back to the USA they will employ Robots. <br />Cause it is cheaper and less risk then hiring a drugged crazy American.<br />And heck they can work 7 days a week instead of 6. <br />So did you guys create new jobs other then begging the rest of the world for money ? <br />From farmers to lawyers to bureaucrats to entrepreneurs to ??? <br />Oh wait you didn´t think so far ahead did you. other then blaiming everybody else for your misery.
Comment220	Mr. Johnson, pls pay a &quot;patent fee&quot; to China&#39;s one country two systems invented by Mr. Deng Xiaoping.
Comment 220.1	Spot on 😂😂
Comment221	Brexit is good for UK.<br />GOOD luck Johnson.
Comment 221.1	@Joanita Fernandes Other than God&#39;s, what other disembodied voices do you hear?
Comment 221.2	@Jacob Jorgenson It good because it&#39;s the Will of GOD for UK.
Comment 221.3	What exactly is good?
Comment222	This is so sad. Those who want no deal or this new play just don&#39;t understand that Boris wants to literally poison your nation and turn you into the states. Mindless drones with chemically treated foods. Remainers are trying to save you from yourself.<br /><br />This reminds me of when my fish jumped out of the tank and killed itself.
Comment 222.1	What a load of rubbish. No wonder your fish jumped out the bowl
Comment223	Loose loose,
Comment224	No Deal
Comment225	It&#39;s so weird to see all of this happening on the macro scale... because it always seemed kinda obvious as to what would happen in these scenarios.<br />For instance, has anyone had any doubt that whatever deal BoJo would come up with would basically be a weakened version of May&#39;s deal? Of course it would. The more time passes, the logical path a deal would take is like that. If more and more times passes after now, the deal will become so completely disadvantageous for the UK that no deal will just be better. Or just rescinding Brexit altogether. Which is likely what the EU wanted in the first place.<br /><br />On the macro scale, what I interpret that happened is more or less like this: UK was part of a economic group. It decided to get out suddenly without a plan, and in a very disfavorable position.<br />An advantageous position would be if this was extremely well planned. For instance, if the UK made a deal with several other EU countries to all get out together, and perhaps even form a new economic block to compete together against the EU. That would have been a master plan. Or even plan an exit backed by several other non-EU countries, that wouldn&#39;t put UK&#39;s economy in doubt if they exited the block. Switch alliances but keep most of the economy intact since it does not depend so heavily on EU countries.<br /><br /><br />But instead, it was decided via referendum to just get out. If you do that, it&#39;s kinda like... cancelling a service contract one sidedly. A well put contract will probably have a whole lot of bullet points there to make it very hard for you do breach it without heavy penalties. Worse yet, if you are very dependant on deals between countries that are already inside the economic block, without some sort of very well thought out plan on how the dependancies will be addressed, your country kinda falls apart. It&#39;s like taking a chainsaw to the surgery table.<br /><br /><br />And so, this is what is happening. Every extension UK asks for, gives more leeway for EU to give up less and less on these negotiations. There&#39;s probably no deal that will pass right now that would be better for the UK in comparison to what May had already came up with.<br />If the current BoJo deal also doesn&#39;t pass, which is probably what will happen since it&#39;s weaker than May&#39;s which was already rejected, then it&#39;s either extension or no deal. There is a very slight possibility that the other side, seeing no way out of this and no way to make anything better than this, would just accept BoJo&#39;s deal because nothing better is on the horizon. But when it comes to politics, the ego battle probably speaks louder. For an opposition party, between giving a half assed victory for BoJo or going the full way to no deal and proving in practice how bad consequences can be is probably the better option.<br />Another extension won&#39;t make a deal any better for the UK. Because EU clearly has the upper hand, they just won&#39;t accept anything less beneficial than May&#39;s deal.<br />Ultimately the best EU option at this point is forcing UK to reconsider and not leave EU at all, which would be an almost catastrophic victory for them.<br /><br /><br /><br />And then, any other option will be disastrous for the UK at this point. No deal, for the entire UK economy. Because if you think logically about it, no deal is just a way of saying there will be no wide reaching country wide accords, and everyone will be left to their own devices to make deals by themselves. UK companies, businesses, corporations, industries and sectors that have import/export interests will be going against a large economic block, which again, is a very disfavorable position. EU countries will demand even more than if UK was part of EU, because that&#39;s what economic blocks are for. Illusions of unity aside, the entire reason economic blocks are formed is so every single country that is part of the block has a strong position against other individual countries.<br /><br />Cancelling Brexit altogether would in turn have disastrous political, international relations and social consequences for the UK. It will create an even deeper divide in the country, tons of brits will see this as a betrayal of democracy, and even those who will be relieved that this didn&#39;t happen will still have to deal with the consequences of all the money, time, and attention wasted with the entire charade. Nothing less than 3+ years of time, money and reshapping of politics that was spent on this. It will radicalize nationalist and populist movements even further, parties and politicians will be heavily discredited from all sides, and there will likely be some heavy protesting.<br /><br /><br />I&#39;m not from the UK... unfortunately never had the opportunity to visit the country too. And don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s not like I hate the UK or have any problems with british people too... it&#39;s just this entire situation is so weird to watch happening. It is similarly as weird as watching what is happening in the US under Trump. It&#39;s like, the entire thing about corruption and radicalization of politics in my own country I can understand. It&#39;s a &quot;shithole&quot; country with politics that have always been corrupt, never worked well, education has always been complete crap, so it&#39;s relatively easy to understand how so many people in my country falls for populist or nationalist propaganda. I always kinda thought that this would be somewhat different, more difficult to happen in developed countries. Democracies being more resistant to such things. But turns out these past few decades proved me wrong. It&#39;s so weird...
Comment226	This Deal Doesn&#39;t give us shit what about are fisheries for a start
Comment227	DUP dont support his deal, now watch what happens when the DUP bring their sectarian military wing unto the streets in the near future.

Comment 234.2	@Fonzie 3.5 years of negotiotiations, 1 extensions another one very soon, 3 priministers and you still think that uk has the balls to leave without a deal, Anyway fingers crossed, wish you dream come True.
Comment 234.3	@Mr M Lipiński We are leaving without a deal anyway whatever you think, rofl
Comment 234.4	@Fonzie it didnt Say leave without a deal, this is your interpretation and this is what I am Talking about everyone has different expectations from this referendum result therefore the result cannot satisfy all of you. If it would mean leave without a deal you would have left by now, not balancing on the edge for over 3 years undecided what to do.
Comment 234.5	@Drake Hound No ofc not offended, was just confused. Yeah, he&#39;s on all the brexit videos spouting crap.
Comment235	Remainers are here again to reject the will of the people expressed in the referendum
Comment 235.1	Jan Sprat then they will send their warriors to colonies EU. Have you forgotten who you are dealing with? 😀😀😀😀
Comment 235.2	Brits don&#39;t want immigration from other European countries or adopt Euro but want to keep all the benefits of being in Europe. Hmmm... So its like saying, I want an Oxford/Cambridge degree but I don&#39;t want to pay for it. Do yourself a favor EU and boot em out.
Comment 235.3	Lance William Tsuji The will of  the people? Please stop this nonsense. It’s pretty clear you are scared of the consequences of leaving. BTW Theresa May got a deal too. A better deal . Britain got a better deal too before Brexit. You can leave the Eu if you want. No nobody is stopping you. It’s a matter of deal or no deal. Don’t you understand The English Language? You took yourselves out of the strongest Economic union. I’m curious about what conditions you will renegotiate in the future. Ireland should sort itself out first.
Comment236	Slippery British politics backfired.<br /><br />Enjoy the show.
Comment 236.1	Agreed, slippery British political move. British politicians are not dumb, they are smart. EU has granted 3 months supplement period for Boris Johnson&#39;s cabinet to solve this Brexit-dilemma or not .  Winston Churchill has said ; you can only choose one, not both of them. =Tears, sweat and uncertainty;
Comment 236.2	I know you,  your brain hasn&#39;t been developed well yet to make a comment...
Comment237	If mps don&#39;t support the deal, after all the drama they&#39;ve caused around no deal, it will show them for what they truly are. A bunch of lying traitors not fit for office. They won&#39;t give us an election so it&#39;s time for the people to take back control. If our MPs betray our vote leave voters need to follow the example set by extinction rebellion. Shut the country down until they honour our vote.
Comment238	I love seeing these &quot;Leaders&quot; in awe of Boris. He is an absolute GENIUS hiding underneath a bumbling clown.<br /><br />Believe me, I know him... This guy is smarter than anyone in the EU and (if I could be clear about one thing) it is Boris that has put a lot of effort into convincing you he&#39;s a bumbling clown.<br /><br />He is way above Trump in creating a public image... We have the strongest leader we have ever had with Boris and I would put my yearly salary on it!<br /><br />Keep your eyes on him... If you think he&#39;s an idiot... Make sure you&#39;re not being stupid enough to understand he WANTS and (to a degree) DEPENDS on you to think that x
Comment 238.1	@Jacob Jorgenson  now now , hes not a miracle worker is he
Comment 238.2	And what did he achieve that will improve your life?
Comment239	It&#39;s not new, it&#39;s a cop and a sham. May&#39;s deal was better and the GDP wll drop much lower with Boris&#39; deal. This is an utter joke
Comment 239.1	@Jacob Jorgenson always the middle class wannabes who are the mosy snobby. So desperate.
Comment 239.2	@Jacob Jorgenson additionally, you can&#39;t climb to my level, you have to be born into it.
Comment 239.3	@Jacob Jorgenson if you want to use gay slang, spell it correctly, <b>sweetie</b>
Comment 239.4	@Jacob Jorgenson lol you really haven&#39;t. I saw the tacky renovations you did. Couldn&#39;t afford professional restoration, obviously. The genuine people can spot the difference and I&#39;m one of them.
Comment 239.5	@Joe Bloggs. I already climbed sweety. See you at the top if you make it
Comment240	Poor poor Jeremy... Even the EU realises you&#39;re DEAD and so is your anti-democratic, flip-flopping bullshit party.<br /><br />Anyone voting Labour or Lib dems in an election vote for LIARS! Look at their last manifestos!!!
Comment241	They are going to hang boris Johnson in the streets lol
Comment242	Still paying £33billion, don&#39;t own our OWN fishing waters, many more year&#39;s of uncertainty. And they&#39;re calling this a &#39;deal&#39;?
Comment243	The romans forced a work force and a barbarian army to swarm our land !
Comment 243.1	Bloody Romans
Comment244	bbc what was your deal?
Comment245	Boris has proved a lot of the remainers wrong. We were all told that he wanted a &quot;No deal Brexit&quot;, that he  wasn&#39;t negotiating and that he prorogued parliament in order to stifle debate and run down the clock.  It seems that for the last 3 months parliament has been working flat-out to oppose the government.  No opposition party has produced a draft deal that they would approve of; but surprise, surprise they are all planning to block the deal this Saturday.<br />The SNP have a point with regards to how Scotland voted, but Labour and the Lib Dems are a complete disgrace. If the EU refuses to grant any extension requested then we leave without a deal on Oct 31st.<br />I sincerely hope they tell the UK parliament before Saturday that no extension will be granted....I think that will concentrate hearts and minds.
Comment 245.1	They approved Mays deal, this is the same deal. It is not done yet.
Comment246	Very good deal for the EU...<br />V Divorce settlement £££.<br />V Free movement for EU citizens within the UK.<br />V The UK will still dance according to EU rules for some years.
Comment 246.1	Agree, it&#39;s an awful deal for UK though
Comment247	its not a deal!
Comment 247.1	It’s a very naughty treaty!
Comment248	What happened to that infamous £350 million per week to EU BUS? Hahaha its a joke<br /><br />I dont understand why EU is fining the UK £33 Billion like on what basis???<br /><br />Why not 100 Billion? Why not 1 Billion. Why not 739 trillion? How do they come up with a figure like this?<br /><br />Can someone explain and give details why this particular amount?<br /><br />Im NOT a remain or pro brexit. Neither. But im not a fan of EU.  EU is too controlling. <br /><br />It just feels like EU is also capitalising on UKs unideal situation. It also feels like EU is capitalising on the fact the Brexit vote was NOT a clean sweep and there is a good portion of people that did not want it. Almost like stirring the shhhhhhhhttt UK is in. <br /><br />So...... if another country in the EU  decides to depart.... They will do the same to them? Make it excruciatingly difficult and costly to depart? <br /><br />I just want Brexit done. It will be hard at first... But the UK will rise from this eventually. <br /><br />But lesson learned, the UK needs to grow some balls. Be strong as an independent nation of 4. Not strong - because of being part of a strong continental union. <br /><br />Again, im not pro or against.. <br /><br />Just want the UK to grow some backbone and be a united nation that can hold its own with the world. Setting its own rules. Its own trade partners. Not a nagging union. <br /><br />UK politicians need to grow backbone too. Partnerships are important. Union is just asking for trouble down the line like this. <br /><br />Union of 4 is enough to deal with already. Let alone dealing a union or european countries. <br /><br />Work with EU not unionise with them. Its like letting a friend live in your own house. Good to start with but too close for comfort when situation changes.
Comment 248.1	@Soda King WELL 😂😂🤣
Comment 248.2	the bus statement was a possibility not a mandate promise , why cant people tell the difference. It was taken to court and thrown out.
Comment 248.3	What I asked about the £33 Billion is simple....... DEEEETAILS. the itemisation, the breakdown. the published document as to how we end up with 33 and not 768 or another figure......<br /><br /><br />its a simple question... but so far what i hear is VAGUE waffles.... you all starting to sound like the politicians you love.
Comment 248.4	Well the 39B£ figure was an estimate of money the UK committed to paying towards various projects in the EU this is basically a divorce settlement because this is effectively what this situation is 39Billion pounds payment it&#39;s a case of no ofc you don&#39;t want to pay it but tough shit because you will not be able to trade with over half a billion people if you don&#39;t  and as far as the 350mil a week that is a ridiculous claim that has never been backed up by ant sort of evidence and was a clear  fear mongering tactic that worked incredibly well the reason it worked so well remember pre brexit vote the remain side were so cocky and arrogant that there was no way they had any hope of losing this vote they half assed the campaign where&#39;s the pro brexit side yes they did lie afair bit but anything they said eapically Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson said with so much passion and volume they projected a message of this is everything to us this means everything to the United kingdom and is incredibly important where&#39;s the remain message was brodcast far more dull you don&#39;t have to like the outcome of Brexit but you all need to understand why this happened and why the remain side actually had a big role in it happening
Comment 248.5	This is previous agreed agreements, such as Nigel Farage&#39;s pension, international police corporations, etc etc
Comment249	Brexitween day will be hard Brexit trick not TREATY
Comment 249.1	Jim Jam A “no-deal’” is possible, but highly unlikely this Halloween.
Comment250	They can&#39;t get a deal because their all criminals stuffing their pockets with your money.
Comment 250.1	Richard Leighton bla-bla-bla
Comment251	Labour and Conservatives will pay next election 🖕
Comment252	You pass a surrender act you get a surrender deal.
Comment 252.1	Really so Those Kingdoms don´t pay taxes?<br />You must be one of those dumb people in the world we need to take away the opnion.<br />And maybe China getting world power is good.<br />Cause reeducation camp that way for dumb people. solves the we can have opnion without consequences.
Comment 252.2	@Drake Hound Yeah...... That surrender deal means  the taxpayers of England get to carry on paying for Scroatland, n Oirland, Wailzzzz AND Kaiser Merkelzzzz fourth Reich gangster globalist GERMan EU empire...... Marvellous... NOT!
Comment 252.3	@Drake Hound Hear, hear. The EU has waited too long for the UK to leave on their own accord. The UK needs a EU lead deadline. And if the UK can&#39;t make that deadline and leave on their own, then they&#39;ll need to be kicked out, otherwise, they never will leave. It&#39;s a huge waste of time and resources to bother negotiating with the UK for so many years. They need to get shit done. Ironically, this is what the UK accused the EU of.<br />You&#39;re running out of scapegoats, Boris. Who will be next?
Comment 252.4	@Solomon Solomon Why it is 3 years EU is tired of waiting forever. <br />No deal lose Scotland and Northern Ireland.<br />BOJO deal lose Northern Ireland. hoping to keep Scotland LOL.<br />May DEALatleast kept UK complete.
Comment 252.5	EUROPEAN UNION should accept extra time. No ideal is better
Comment253	Countries in the EU hope there&#39;s a possibility that we won&#39;t leave and I don&#39;t blame them. However a democratic decision was made and now the Queen has spoken in almost support of it, they&#39;ve no choice but to fall in line.
Comment 253.1	Well, you don&#39;t want your economic part we to get poorer, everybody loses
Comment 253.2	Just leave already
Comment 253.3	You could leave in March, but asked for extension, you can leave in October but Will probably ask for extension... Dont ask and leave..
Comment254	When &quot;what on earth&quot; used in a formal forum
Comment 254.1	I&#39;m concerned as well, it seems very impolite
Comment255	Lib Dems:  “ The economic consequence of this deal will be worse than the financial crisis” <br />Oh just shut the fuck up🤦‍♂️
Comment256	Boris Johnson - BRAVO !!!
Comment 256.1	@frantisek velat Hello, you seem to know more English, than I know any-other language, so bravo! Love to you and your country too! 😘
Comment 256.2	@Yattaman-  halló, i dont no englisch, i love Britain ! 🙂 fadím Britanii a nelíbí se mi, že je EU trestá, protože se rozhodli v referendu o vystoupení z EU, no a vše se dozvím z našich zpráv, nebo jsou li cz.titl. ☺
Comment 256.3	frantisek velat Will Saturday’s meaningful vote need or get an ENCORE ???
Comment257	Paying £33B is simply a no brainer.
Comment 257.1	@mrwideboy that was because the UK had a female PM.
Comment 257.2	@Limmy Writer you haven&#39;t a clue.i lived in the 1970s and just about remember it. The UK was going down the toilet fast that&#39;s why we joined.
Comment 257.3	@mrwideboy the hell with the free market. UK was doing just fine without the EU.
Comment 257.4	@Limmy Writer we are not being held to ransom who told you that ?  We are independent  but if are going to have a free market then you have to have rules and a court of law
Comment 257.5	@mrwideboy so what. We can&#39;t be held ransom. Be independent
Comment258	I really don t understand DUP With the deal it will be no hard border without deal it will be.
Comment 258.1	The DUP are trying to destroy good Friday agreement.  They only used it during negotiations as a convenience.  If they could have a trump wall at the border they would jump at it.
Comment 258.2	The DUP hates the fact that they will be Irish for 2 years (cause with this deal they will have to stay in the costumes union for at least that time) they don’t really care that much about a hard Brexit, cause they can blame the nationalist on any riot that follows
Comment259	"At the end, the European Union has won the blame game. And this practically<br />with the same deal they signed with Teresa May. Big win"
Comment 259.1	@Celcra they to use your words won by knowing they had no obligation to really concede anything and they were in the powerful position negotiation wise basically they quickly realised who really will get shafted more if this deal goes sour
Comment 259.2	They won by refusing to play.
Comment260	Want out ..
Comment261	Get done
Comment262	Next he&#39;ll try to build a bloody big wall across the channel and make the mexicans pay for it. Oh wait, different lunatic..
Comment 262.1	@Lance William Tsuji could be cause of your shitty english
Comment 262.2	@Texsama you didn&#39;t also get the joke did you? how sad...
Comment 262.3	@Lance William Tsuji You didn&#39;t get the joke did you? Sad..
Comment 262.4	Wall in channel...<br />Mexicans to pay...<br /><br />Are you lunatic? 🙄
Comment263	Good job Boris. If it doesnt get through parliament, I think it will get through on a referendum.
Comment 263.1	@Soda King This surrender deal is an asset strippers charter for GERMany.....
Comment 263.2	@Soda King <br />Except the 55% would be for remain.
Comment 263.3	Do you seriously think the British Public deserves another referendum, on anything...
Comment 263.4	@rick Woods I AM USING THE INTERNET, WHAT DETAIL(S) IN PARTICULAR ARE YOU REFERRING TO?!<br /><br />STICK IT TO THE TRAITOR BORIS!! VOTE BREXIT PARTY, GET HIM OUT OF DOWNING STREET!!!!!
Comment264	Its a sell out
Comment 264.1	786qad - it’s good for the community of EU politicians yeah
Comment 264.2	It’s not a sell out, it’s a compromise.. do you understand that word?
Comment 264.3	Benn act protects humanity and voices the will of the people who represent the voting class and how Brexit will effect communities, for the many...
Comment 264.4	Andrew Crawford - it’s the best deal you’re going to get with a Surrender Act for the other side to lean on
Comment265	When you have access to 500.000 customers with no extra taxes or customs ... but you want to leave that market so your products go under extra custom costs if you still want to sell your stuff to the same 500.000 customers ... Only UK knows why ... no one in Europe or in the World knows ... 😂😂

Comment 265.3	@Mr M Lipiński You have a dog in the fight?
Comment 265.4	@Isochest enforcement of german as official language? I dont know where you get it from but it would suit Nigel Farage the german passport holder, his German wife and german Kids.
Comment266	The orange card finally gets the red card.
Comment 266.1	@R Not sure who you mean when you say &quot;us.&quot;
Comment 266.2	Dubthach Boris’ “deal” is a trap locking us into the EU, stopping us controlling our own coastal waters, foreign policy and tax rates! Reject this deal! No deal and WTO the only option!
Comment 266.3	and... there it is,  the race card.   because you can&#39;t argue against Brexit.
Comment 266.4	@O&#39;Kane yes an yes ... also their dispencable when they get in the way of the UK moving forward they get dropped like a hot potato..  truthfully though their a bigoted racist party from another century.
Comment267	Any BBC perspective reaction is now taken with a pinch of salt. They have shown for 3+ years now the REMAIN side they support. Such bias.
Comment 267.1	Because  leaving is bad for the UK! You should thank them really
Comment 267.2	Is simply reporting on the difficulties of the brexit process remainer opinion?
Comment268	I am classified as a brexiteer because i love my country,  believe in democracy and believe a country has a right to make its own laws and not be subservient to foreign interests.. i cannot  fathom how anyone could support  being ruled by others it makes absolutely no sense. Considering the people were never given a vote to surrender our rights in the first place. Dodgey back door deals by traitors without our permission have taken us from membership to an economic union to being a subservient province of Europe.  But if u have swallowed the bs u hv been fed i respect yr right to vote how u choose. But how can anyone seriously accept the betrayals we hv witnessed over the past few years. We have 1 simple choice to make over all others.. do we want to live in a dictatorship or a democracy?  Politicians from all parties hv betrayed the people, inaction in our behalf will ensure our children and future generations will never have a voice of their own. There needs to be a people intervention. Government needs to be brought to account,  the mp&#39;s that have gone against the majority vote need to face trial. Democracy only exists if the mp&#39;s honour the will of the people. If we the people don&#39;t make a stand now we loose everything.  If yr a parent or wish to be one day.. shame on u if u do nothing and strip yr children from being free and having a voice of their own.
Comment 268.1	@Jacob Jorgenson its about sovereignty.. if yr too blind and stupid to understand or happy to see yr children and grandchildren dictated to and have no voice of their own then shame on u.
Comment 268.2	Give me a list of EU laws you have suffered under?
Comment 268.3	Better hide your comment. You gonna be labelled far-right fascist.
Comment269	If someone could tell me the total amount of times the economics editor in Washington blinked then they earn 14 lad points and a bowl of wheetos
Comment 269.1	Eyed ont no
Comment 269.2	😂😂😂
Comment270	Drunker and Bojo.<br />It won&#39;t be good.
Comment271	No deal  Britains gonna pay for that
Comment272	I really hope it all works out soon for the benefit of everyone and that Parliament works in good faith without anymore grandstanding.
Comment 272.1	Hoping that &quot;Parliament works&quot; at all is wishful thinking.  Demo-narchy doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s a deal with the devil.
Comment273	So NI stays in the EU? Can Scotland stay too? Why do you have Brexit when only England woted out? Please do have Englexit.
Comment 273.1	Is Scotland not part of the U.K? Yes it is. Does it border the EU at a historically tragic and politically sensitive point, like N Ireland? No it does not. There is no comparison. London also voted to remain and it’s population is way larger than Scotland’s. Tell you what, rather than having another indie ref, can the rest of the U.K. just have a vote to kick the Scots the fuck out instead?
Comment 273.2	Yes the Scottish people voted by 62% to stay in the EU and are being forced out by Westminster.<br />Scotland should be allowed to stay in the EU like Northern Ireland who also voted by a majority to stay in the EU.
Comment 273.3	Any more free loaders want to fuck off? Go for your lives &amp; goodbye
Comment 273.4	shawn yates Welsh, or English living there?
Comment 273.5	Wales voted out too ;-)
Comment274	Boris&#39;s bullshit of betrayal birthing BRINO brings bitterness.  This new EU treaty is 95% &quot;May&#39;s deal&quot; and the other 5% is the lipstick on May&#39;s pig: remains does the deprivation of control of UK&#39;s fishing territory and EU&#39;s imposition of compulsory regulatory re-alignment including taxation to deprive the UK of efficiency and competitiveness and this exposes the Boris&#39;s bungling and betrayal all in one.  Nigel&#39;s is correct, clean Brexit -- not this BRINO.
Comment275	I think it&#39;s obvious many people who voted for Brexit had second thoughts after the propaganda wore off so why not just have a second vote to settle the matter ?
Comment 275.1	@Jacob Jorgenson what are you on about. Do you really believe he is the only politician who has lied? I personally have wanted to leave the Eu for years long before the vote as have many of my friends because it has been detrimental to myself and many of the poorest areas and to low skilled workers. I voted out and I&#39;m afraid my vote counts as much as yours. What do you want a super vote so your vote   counts more. Clegg lied Blair lied, they all lie.
Comment 275.2	@Christine Dennison The Boris surrender deal have little chance of getting through, but then he&#39;s been lying his whole life so why stop now
Comment 275.3	We had a vote,  there has been propaganda yes, especially from the BBC and the biased politicians who have systematically worn the public down.
Comment 275.4	Be sure they are like children who have seen the cookie
Comment 275.5	I don&#39;t know any brexiters who have changed their minds, though some remained friends of mine now want out.

Comment 280.2	@Jan Sprat Yes We want out of this revolting empire!
Comment 280.3	@Niku Nashi You voted out the EU did not vote you out . You had a contract , like all contracts it must be paid in full before exit . After that you are free to  trade with whoever you like including the EU  if you can reach a deal with them on trade and travel and rights . If by crashing you you damage the good Friday agreement you will not be signing a trade deal with the USA . That is the situation . Like most of Europe we would like to see you gone and ideally your landmass transported   to somewhere near Australia
Comment281	It’s a very poor treaty awful all power to Eu
Comment 281.1	Yes, power to the EU, power to us (you are still part of it)! 😁
Comment 281.2	Brexit is undemocratic.
Comment 281.3	Get used to it. After this begins the negotiations for trade. After EU, NAFTA and BRICS is done with UK, i am surprised if they have even their flag left. Global trade is not about charity, it is about squeezing much as you can.
Comment282	Why don’t bbc call it a treaty that’s what it is
Comment 282.1	@:: I AM ON THE INTERNET, WHAT&#39;S A CRACK PIPE?
Comment 282.2	@Yattaman First, put the crackpipe down, and then go on the Internet.....

Comment283	Surrender Monkey Johnson just gave up the United Kingdom in order to save Brexit!
Comment 283.1	@Lance William Tsuji You are mistaken. I want the UK out for decades!
Comment 283.2	Hello remainer
Comment 283.3	@Celcra Capitulation to Boris&#39;s bullshit of betrayal birthing BRINO is NOT the answer.  Clean, unsullied Brexit is required as a first step to reduce parasitism.
Comment 283.4	@Jason PK so what is it you WANT then? Except civil war back?
Comment 283.5	Not Brexit -- BRINO (Brexit In Name ONLY).   Boris&#39;s bullshit of betrayal birthing BRINO brings bitterness.  This new EU treaty is 95% May&#39;s deal&quot; and the other 5% is the lipstick on May&#39;s pig: remains does the deprivation of control of UK&#39;s fishing territory and EU&#39;s imposition of compulsory regulatory re-alignment including taxation to deprive the UK of efficiency and competitiveness and this exposes the Boris&#39;s bungling and betrayal all in one.  Nigel&#39;s is correct, clean Brexit -- not this BRINO.
Comment284	He didn&#39;t want to pay the divorce bill,  but now is looking forward that UK has to pay the 33 Billions GBP (33,000,000,000 GBP)
Comment 284.1	The UK has already lost 70bill and the sterling has lost more value than the UK has ever paid the EU in 46 years

Comment 285.4	@Alfa&amp;Omega 00000 moral of the story, don&#39;t pick a fight then complain when you get your arse kicked.
Comment286	At a even larger expense.
Comment287	We need to remove the tentacles of the EU from our country completely.
Comment 287.1	But first let the EU get rid of yours.
Comment288	Disgusting treaty
Comment 288.1	A Surrender Act gets you a Surrender Treaty. But this isn’t as bad a ol Nigel would have you think the wiley Fox
Comment 288.2	Surrender treaty
Comment 288.3	Behave. Neither perfect nor awful
Comment289	It’s worse than Mays
Comment 289.1	@Jacob Jorgenson <b>facepalm</b> There is no illegal immigration from  EU nationals. Currently they are free to come and go as they please hence we have no control over borders effectively- personally I don&#39;t really care about immigration. As for regulatory alignments these are simply on EU  trade. Any trade deal with any nation would expect such a thing, ie you have to meet US trading standards to export to US and vice versa. The point is we can now make our own trade deals with rapidly growing markets on our own terms. Brexit was always about this.
Comment 289.2	@K. C. all the regulation and all the expense without any say. The UK will be poorer, most illegal immigration comes from outside the EU.
Comment 289.3	Nonsense
Comment 289.4	How so?
Comment290	How can u leave the EU if your own government is voting against you? You Brits are soo extra. Just leave already and stay in your little shitty island.
Comment291	Why don’t bbx call it what it is a treaty ??
Comment292	Prime Minister Johnson please...
Comment293	Labor Party leader Communist Jeremy Corbyn, says he will vote against this new deal 🤨<br />Corbyn is an enemy of the UK 😡
Comment 293.1	Good. Hat off to JC
Comment294	What a load of old tosh.<br />When will people understand , unless you&#39;re a  useless,  entitled boomer , your only use in this world is to be shafted at regular intervals by the establishment.
Comment295	# MY HEAD DOES Not  zip up ThE Back.<br />DITTO heads.<br /> REMAIN.
Comment 295.1	Clair Duffy   You’re right !!!  REMAIN !!!<br /><br />Nothing else is acceptable now !!!!
Comment 295.2	Clair Duffy   Sorry Clair. Brexit is upon you. You’ll be better off.
Comment296	"Just do <a href=""http://it.com/"">it.com</a> and get over it."
Comment 296.1	But it&#39;s not over. Years of chaos coming up where the UK is still having to follow EU regulation because 45% of UK trade with EU
Comment297	I can guarantee you guys, no matter what deal is negotiated no matter who dictates negotiations the bill will not be passed. Not too many of the MPS are prepared to compromise. We need to extend the deadline until 31st December, organise a general election for November, every party lays out their idea for post Brexit Britain and let us the people decide what future we want for our country post Brexit
Comment298	UK government is on its knees. This is a big test for EU
Comment 298.1	Antiquus Custos, I start to think that way my self too
Comment 298.2	Soda King, actually EU has been quite lenient which might have been a mistake. If there would have been tighter rope, perhaps UK&#39;s politicians would take this more seriously.
Comment 298.3	@Sami Sund the EU hold all the cards here anyone who says otherwise is a fool they have no obligation to make any concessions and probably won&#39;t  it&#39;s not In their interest for the UK to leave the EU so naturally they are doing the we are gonna make this as hard as possible for you because we don&#39;t want you to leave and even if you refuse to stay we will damn sure make this as hard as we can on you
Comment 298.4	On their knees, with mouths wide open . A sad end to a once proud empire
Comment 298.5	@Sami Sund Because they do not want to.
Comment299	Divorce Bill, Entrapped in EU regulation, Northern Irish humiliation. This deal is unacceptable; but it always would be.  Boris has been forced by parliament to make concessions at the expense of the public, he cannot issue a no deal Brexit. The ignorance and incompetence in the Labour Party has brought the country to its knees
Comment 299.1	No, not really. What makes you think that the country will be poorer
Comment 299.2	@Joe Thompson yeah , better to be poorer right?
Comment 299.3	Remain cannot be an option under any circumstance. To remain would be to undermine the very fabric of our democracy. God we are in a right mess
Comment 299.4	Well Joe then it comes to a simple concept of this is the only deal we are getting if you don&#39;t like this deal either no deal or remain idk if the last will be an option probably
Comment 299.5	Didn&#39;t Boris start all this by lying about 350mill a week. This did not need to happen
Comment300	Good Job Boris.  Now we can watch those liberal and labour TRAITORS f it up.
Comment301	Is this deal much different than Mays deal.. other than the backstop?
Comment 301.1	@Knut Katastrophe how the backstop changed. But no difference to having to follow eu law on all issues,continuing fisheries restrictions, continuing open borders no immigration control, future eu military help,   eu have a say over our tax  and we carry on paying 38billion oh and we have no meps, wake up
Comment 301.2	Lol. Tbf yeah 1. it enables free trade deals to be negotiated almost immediately subject to a few restrictions on regulatory alignment, 2. N Ireland will also benefit from any new trade deals we have by being in the U.K. customs territory, 3. they will reap additional economic input from also being in the EU Customs remit and so you can see a lot of wealth flowing north of the land border from south, also keeping them closer to the EU in principle but their consent to this must be reiterated by the elected N Ireland assembly every four years, 4. good crossing the west across the Irish Sea will be subject to EU tariffs, if they are liable to cross south of the Irish border 5. the end destination is for a comprehensive FTA as per the Political Declaration, instead of a closer trading relationship, making point 4 ultimately redundant, 6. there are less legal certainties with regard to regulatory alignment with EU standards on workers and environmental rights, which cynics believe we can not elect our governments to get right.
Comment 301.3	Maybe
Comment 301.4	Yes
Comment 301.5	No
Comment302	Thank you.
Comment303	bojo surrender deal show&#39;s the back stop was not a trap
Comment304	Brexit party!!!
Comment 304.1	Haha farage hates the deal, why? Because his gravy train of doing nothing but whine and rev up simpletons with fake slogans like &quot; we want our fishings rights, we want blue passports, we will be in Berlin the day after the vote, 350mill a week
Comment 304.2	What on earth do Brexit Party offer other than imminent No Deal? After we leave on No Deal then what? We cannot go on trading on WTO terms with EU forever so another deal would have to be struck which would involve compromises, trade offs and regulatory alignments etc anyway
Comment 304.3	You mean craps racist party ? Nonsence
Comment305	A &quot;Great New Deal&quot; with no Tax Independence and no Military Independence..
Comment 305.1	@Antiquus Custos The EU has always been and still is ahead of the US in the past on GDP PPP. The EU has been ahead of the US by one to two trillion dollars on GDP PPP<br />But in terms of GDP you are (almost) not entirely wrong since the EU has always been ahead of the US since its creation regressing (not much) only in the last four years.<br />During 1980, the US GDP was $2.9 trillion, whereas the EU GDP was $3.8 trillion. Their GDP have been growing at a similar pace. The EU has been ahead of the US on GDP during most of the years in the past. Now, the US is ahead (not much) of the EU.
Comment 305.2	@Argot Calo The UK in the EU had all the advantages and none of the disadvantages. It kept its own currency, central bank, it was out of Schengen but part of a huge free market of 500 million people, and could make its own laws and veto any EU law it didn&#39;t like. The only thing they had to accept was free circulation of goods and people. Now that the Polish workers are leaving, you will have to get more immigrants from Asia, so much for your (European) culture.<br />I don&#39;t blame the UK, I just think it did a very stupid decision. <br />Lust and greed for money is a very British trait, what do you have against that?<br />Its going to be interesting watching you begging your ex colonies like India for trade deals, or China!: They are going to make you wait in the antechambers with your hats off and on your knees just for the fun of it. Do you think they have forgotten the way you treated them? And the US? Hahaha! They only do their interests: there is never been such a thing as a &quot;special relation&quot;. <br />So, while in the EU you had great power and influence, a negative influence I would add, since you only first joined the Common Market to save your Economy, and then stayed to make sure Europe would never actually become a real Union. Outside the EU you will become more and more irrelevant. So I think it&#39;s splendid that you are leaving, it will strenghthen the creation of a real European Union without your obstructionism.  Just please make up your mind an do it! Leave! Goodbye!
Comment 305.3	@000dodo000 The economy of the entire EU is lower than of the US and is just little above that of China.<br /><br />I wonder where real economic power is lmao. The EU has regressed since its creation.
Comment 305.4	"@000dodo000 <br />Lust for money is the only thing that the EU members have in common.<br />But when other things apart from the economy start to come in play, let&#39;s see if the EU continue as today.<br />You can trash the UK, but they wanted self-determination to guide their laws, their goverment and their culture.<br />Can you blame them?"
Comment 305.5	@Argot Calo With out the UK constant sabotage following the orders of its US master, The EU will thrive. Its already the world&#39;s largest economic power.<br />Goodbye and good riddance!
Comment306	The BBC reporter is so rude.
Comment 306.1	So rude, so so rude.
Comment307	So, its vote for this deal or its a no deal exit on the 31st regardless by the sounds of things. No extension. ( of course Parliament, commons and Lords could attempt to revoke A50 but they will wipe themselves out in the process, self sacrifice isn&#39;t something these individuals are known for ).  Looks like its game over.
Comment 307.1	No.. there is a third option rearing its head... the probability of a 2nd referendum pushed through by self-serving MPs.  Mind... if Nigel doesn&#39;t like it, that is terrible!!
Comment 307.2	EU is open for extensions long as there are some progress and there won&#39;t be any deal in effect if it is voted down.
Comment 307.3	@Sami Sund Yeah but A50 says if a deal is in place its not a requirement to ask for one, same with the &quot;Ben act&quot;, its only to prevent &quot;no deal&quot;, there&#39;s a deal. If parliament votes it down he&#39;s not required to make a request and the EU has said no more extensions this time. From what I understand its this or no deal on the 31st.
Comment 307.4	Boris agreed to ask extension in case of no deal
Comment308	Even after Brexit, through negotiations, UK will act as full member of EU. Just to please people who voted for Brexit. Why people just don&#39;t want to admit EU is very strong economically and politically.
Comment 308.1	@jimmy2minutes I wish you good luck as well. True, it will cost a bit mor to be in the EU after GB left. But it costs a lott more to be outside the EU. All those certifications, border patrol, import/export, being less atractive to xlreign countrys as access point to the single market, ...
Comment 308.2	@jimmy2minutes it was funding them. They&#39;re gonna be screwed even more now. But hey, that&#39;s the bed that&#39;s made.
Comment 308.3	@Soda King its going to be great once we get settled in.
Comment 308.4	Mike when the dust settles and the history is written down about brexit I promise you one thing that will happen alot of people are going to be shafted in some way
Comment 308.5	@Celcra we are coming out of the single market. It doesn&#39;t cost that much to be in it anyway.  Anyway wish us luck on as we expand our dreams. Hope you pull through.  Its about to get a bit more expensive to be in the EU.
Comment309	If the EU loving Biased Broadcasting c**ts don&#39;t like the deal then it must be a good deal. Time will tell.
Comment310	PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.<br /><br /><br />The EU will NEVER make a good deal that will be passed by parliament.<br /><br />This is because they don&#39;t want the UK to leave the EU and are forcing the UK into a second referendum.<br /><br />The remainer MPs in parliament will stop any deals for the same reason.
Comment 310.1	Antiquus Custos, That is far from opposing EU and fact is, those small time deals with small countries are not enough to support the infrastructure of UK which will become even more bloated and expensive after brexit. Also UK needs those deals while the other countries have already established their position in global trade market, for them it means they can pretty much dictate the terms of those deals, it doesn&#39;t help that UK can&#39;t even make comprehensive trade deals before it has reformed infrastructure and laws considering trade.
Comment 310.2	@Antiquus Custos the Eton deceivers do not care about little Britain
Comment 310.3	@Sami Sund yup, if you are not sitting at the table you are on the menu
Comment 310.4	Just shows how Willing is Boris to throw the UK under a bus
Comment 310.5	@draaienmaar <br /><br />The EU are not happy with the UK wanting to leave.
Comment311	It all began when the Protestant Queen Elizabeth II beat the Catholic Pope at the battle of the Boyne in what was then just &#39;Ireland&#39; or &#39;Éire&#39; and because the Queen won the battle having personally killed over 70 Catholics with her sword while on horseback (she loves her horses)  she owned all of Ireland but eventually the Irish people regrouped and grew stronger than they had ever been before and formed what is known today as the IRA (Irish Republican Army) the Queen was getting on a bit in age and so retired to Scotland, instead she sent poor protestants from England, Wales and Scotland who had committed crimes such as stealing bread to feed their families, she sent them to the North of Ireland landing at a harbour in the village of Carrickfergus, they were joined by a small man of wealthy origins called Wee Billy of Orange who came all the way from a European country called Holland hence the &#39;Orange&#39; being the colour of Holland.  This small wee man was so small he had to ride a wee pony instead of a horse... anyway to get back on point he began to lead these poor protestants of which he was also protestant down to a place called &#39;Baile átha Cliath&#39; now known as &#39;Dublin&#39; but along the way he was ambushed by the IRA and his wee white pony reared up throwing him to the ground breaking his neck and the rest of his men known as the Orange men because their leader was wee Billy of Orange aka Holland were blown to bits by IRA bombs those who survived made their way back to the North of Ireland where they remain today and they still remain loyal to their past of British heritage, unfortunately their brethren in Britain do not have any loyalty to them in return and well we are were we are in regards Brexit and several attempts later to throw the Loyal Ulster peasants under the bus.  No doubt they will still remain Loyal to those who continue to betray them, sad really.
Comment 311.1	@Jacob Jorgenson I thought that was as weaponized burger king shake? Strawberry I believe. With sprinkles.
Comment 311.2	@Mr Kupus they do if Farage is speaking
Comment 311.3	@Mr Kupus Chicken, it&#39;s in our name.
Comment 311.4	@Mr Kupus i never realised that, I wonder why?
Comment 311.5	I think the real question is ; Why don&#39;t KFC sell milkshakes?
Comment312	It all reminds me of a schoolboy scenario frightened to jump in the swimming pool at the swimming baths.
Comment 312.1	maybe the sharks waiting to asset strip the UK has something to do with it?<br />brexit was funded to crash the pound.
Comment313	if the EU approved it then there&#39;s no good for us in it , that&#39;s how they got us when they were EEC remember back when this bag of cack all started ...
Comment 313.1	Wait what? The UK BEGGED to join the single market and has do e amazing inside the last 46 years. It&#39;s WESTMINSTER, not the EU that fucked the UK and we just saw it happen again.
Comment 313.2	@Rubber Dub Yes, thats also a good description of Brexiteers.
Comment 313.3	EU appeasement over patriotism = traitorous Quisling ..
Comment 313.4	@Rubber Dub No arguments + no manners = brexiteer
Comment 313.5	@Rubber Dub Seems to me that you just disagree with the EU no matter what. Whether they include the UK or help it to find a way out, it&#39;s all a sham to you. Deals are never in favor or acceptable to one party only. They need to please both sides and respect agreements made earlier.
Comment314	We leave on the 31st one way or another or there will be riots.
Comment 314.1	@Danny boy why racist. Do you have to be racist to want out of the EU. Grow up  pulling the race card. I have lots of Muslim and white friends that voted leave. Are they all racist. You complete moron
Comment 314.2	@Public Public I doubt that very much
Comment 314.3	Riots means... Jail
Comment 314.4	@T_ C i aggree with you🤣
Comment 314.5	🤣 🤣 🤣 Idiotic talk. Try RIOTS and you will end up in jail and i believe is good for you because is where uneducated racist people like you belong. Nonsense
Comment315	39 billion?? Wow
Comment 315.1	@Jacob Jorgenson thought the pound was flying.  And at least we don&#39;t have negative interest rates. Things aren&#39;t that bad. You need to update your info.
Comment 315.2	"Jacob Jorgenson ... <a href=""https://youtu.be/pm8l_XLsfXE"">https://youtu.be/pm8l_XLsfXE</a>.   It’s 39 Billion like I said they UPDATED their numbers"
Comment 315.3	33bill. But then the UK has already lost 70bill and the pound has lost more value than has been paid to the EU in 46 years. Just released numbers predicts UK GDP dropping as much as 6% which means the NHS, police and military will either see serious cuts or UK borrowing will explode. <br />In short, everybody is loosing
Comment 315.4	They’ve updated the number to 39 billion pounds!!!
Comment 315.5	Wish my divorce was as lucrative.
Comment316	A dreadful deal and it will not fly without a referendum amendment. If that happens there will have to be an extension and the referendum will be a win for Remain. Good job too.
Comment317	It also needs the approval of certain Paramilitary organisations in both ROI and NI to make it into reality
Comment 317.1	@Chillin Like A Villain No the dup, who represent a third of the NI electorate, rejected it. NI voted to remain.
Comment 317.2	NI already rejected it
Comment318	Corbyn thinks, no proof just an opinion 🤔😊😂
Comment319	Why the hell should we pay £33 billion for a devorse and what does the UK get in return nothing???? Britain should leave the E.U without a deal
Comment 319.1	@https://www.youtube.com/user/LiamMacSuibhne idfk what about this do people not understand Jesus Christ how many people really were educated enough about the EU to properly vote in brexit man deny it if you want but ignorance won that referendum
Comment 319.2	@rick Woods Strange, you seem to belive evetything the brexit liers tell you. And from your post two things are dadly verry clear: you don&#39;t care and you don&#39;t thibk (for yourself).
Comment 319.3	@rick Woods The answer to your questions is: &quot;access to the single market&quot;.
Comment320	Remainers will reject any deal because they still wish to remain in the EU.
Comment 320.1	Because the best deal the UK will ever have is the current one
Comment 320.2	@AWResistance you tell them, babe 😘
Comment 320.3	@Public Public It&#39;s happening mate. It&#39;s always best in life to accept what is inevitable; like death and taxes.
Comment 320.4	because the very best deal is no brexit and everyone knows it.
Comment321	With luck the deal is a good one.  If not we leave on the 31st with no deal.  Sounds like job done.
Comment 321.1	@000dodo000 haha US is a lot better than being in the EU. We want our country back. Simple as that now fuck off
Comment 321.2	@Mr M Lipiński learn some politics and political law before commenting you moron
