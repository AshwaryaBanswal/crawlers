Comment1	I am not an expert, however if you deflate a solid sphere from within you are just looking for trouble. But hey as long as gas is cheap why worry. Considering the sphere is orbiting the sun, and the commodity they use to get cheap gas is finite, why worry.
Comment2	Thank you once again Dutch and Copper. I was watching and realised it was the live forecast I&#39;ve already seen. God bless you and your familie and much 💖😁🌋😽🐟.

Comment10	Hi Dutch:  I am really interested in the coast of Oregon, Lincoln City and Portland Oregon too.
Comment11	Dutch,<br /> My husband is Indonesian and we have family in West Java Bandung very close to the  Mt. Tangkuban Parahu volcano. Thank God they are ok, however I wanted to mention that, one of the lady&#39;s in a video of the volcano erupting, mentions that there is a earthquake happening, but on my earthquake app, there are no reports of any earthquakes in Bandung whatsoever??? For the last 24hrs. Just thought it was very strange, that they haven&#39;t reported any earthquakes in that particular area of Indonesian, for over a week now!!  So for all the grammar errors 😂 Good Lord!!! Can someone say proofread your comment before you hit the send button🤣🤣🤣
Comment 11.1	Also, sometimes we don&#39;t get the option to go back and correct what we&#39;ve said.
Comment 11.2	@Christina Sibuea ripping someone for grammar detracts from the subject.  Most people I converse with on YouTube or Facebook use English as a second language.  I&#39;m just glad I can talk to average people who are there.  Lastly,  I&#39;m pretty sure my grammar and spelling aren&#39;t perfect because I&#39;m on my phone and the keyboard sucks. Stay safe!
Comment 11.3	@Wanda Tolbert <br />Thanks Wanda!! Sorry I should have double checked all my grammer before hand🤣 I&#39;m surprised you could make sense out of it🤣 Thanks for not ripping me to pieces for all the errors;)
Comment 11.4	They lie. Thanks for the info
Comment12	P.S. your voice has a  reassuring tone to it. I still say you could be a news anchor . Thanks again

Comment18	Sorry if I blew a surprise but I dreamt she was lol
Comment19	Is the Dutchess pregnant?! Is that the news we get to hear about in a couple months? WOOHOO!
Comment 19.1	That was my first thought.
Comment20	You need to get a grant for earthquake research.  I know grant exist.  They have them for tornado research.  Three storms chasers was killed during research years ago.  They were famous too.  Get a grant.  It will shut the professionals up.
