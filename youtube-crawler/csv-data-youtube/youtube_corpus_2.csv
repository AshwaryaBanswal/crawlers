Comment3	Man-made climate hoax is literally causing teenage suicides
Comment 3.1	Nope I think they already had issues but it&#39;s climate hype not really climate change or something else. When you keep saying &quot;You&#39;ll die in 10 years&quot; teens can react like ... kids ?
Comment4	Utter rubbish BBC  go away  with ya propoganda bs
Comment5	How many of these Climate change warriors will make the effort to actually go out and vote?  Let&#39;s see demographics of voters and see the ages of those who vote.  It was been suggested that the vote should be extended to 16-17 year olds and stop over 75s from voting.  Apart from being undemocratic the reality is that the the percentage of those who voted would plummet.<br />The youngsters talk the talk, but, that is all they do. If they really wanted to change things they would go out in the &#39;cold and dark&#39; and vote for the parties that are taking the climate change seriously.  And before you think only the young care think on this, it is older people who recycle now we know about climate change, we aren&#39;t the ones changing our smartphones when the latest model comes out, do they know where the minerals for the batteries come from and how that impacts the local wildlife?  <br />So any youngsters reading this, recycle and stop throwing your litter everywhere, don&#39;t smoke because the biggest proportion of litter world wide is fag ends, don&#39;t believe me then just go to anywhere that smokers congregate when at work or socialise and see the mounds of fag ends, you&#39;re doing yourself a favour too.  And stop blaming us older people, we didn&#39;t know what was going on, except for the ozone layer and we did something about that and now we want to help the planet for our descendants and we&#39;ll be the ones making the effort to vote.  <br />Another reason to avoid Brexit, we will be beholden to America, which just left the Paris Accord (although, hopefully temporarily) and we know how Trump operates.  Do not vote Tory as this will be the worst thing for the environment.  I&#39;m voting Labour, I think they are the party that will realistically give us a chance to change things.
Comment6	progressive derangement syndrome
Comment7	Go away you filthy liberal.
Comment8	If I look at 11 Green MEP out of 73 UK MEP, it would seem to me that British politics would have been much greener if some form of proportional representation was implemented instead of first-passed=the-post election system that leads to so many lost votes and tactical voting.
Comment9	Its actually the &quot;democracy election&quot;.... not a brexit election, not a climate election an election for democracy itself. What type of country do you want to live in?
Comment 9.1	gilkesisking an honest one.
Comment10	Climate change propaganda means nothing to most people.<br />This election is about the future of Britain and whether we accept democracy or not and democracy will win<br />ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§&gt;ðŸ’©&gt;ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º
Comment11	I want to know where the party&#39;s stand on a carbon tax and passing legislation to get manufacturers to publish publicly how to fully recycle their goods instead of leaving that responsibility on consumers
Comment12	You honestly think Bank&#39;s would be dishing out 30 year mortgages if half the planet would be under water. <br />Research the UNs Agenda 30. <br />Depopulation.
Comment13	&quot;Did you ever feel politics is just shouting and game playing&quot; YES ! And fearmongering usually about end of the world due climate change in 1 year and LGBTQXYZ rights. YES !
Comment 13.1	@Eddy .Traarbach I was making fun of ignorant reporter , I don&#39;t discriminate people , I laugh at people trying to do stupid reports without any scientific knowledge and lacking ability to hear what they&#39;re saying.
Comment 13.2	Don&#39;t be trapped in a self fulfilling philosophy! Too many people are too easy to be fooled! And you may feel that LGBTQXYZ rights is not about you, but the truth is that discrimination can only be fought against succesfully when it&#39;s been done consistently. So allowing others to be discriminated, facilitates your discrimination!
Comment14	Climate fake scam. Let the peeps free from Roman fascist rule......clowns

Comment17	I&#39;m not that bothered by climate change, it&#39;s other people&#39;s kids all they do is try to get them into positions of power so they can be your new rulers, I&#39;ve heard them speaking, the truth is I&#39;d probably be better off if they all died from climate change.
