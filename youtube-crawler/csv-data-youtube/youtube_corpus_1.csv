Comment1	Only 500 people own half of Scotland.She is obviously appeasing them and ONLY them.
Comment2	Every time I hear this woman I think of Tracy Ullman&#39;s impression of her. I expect &quot;Wee Mairi&quot; to pop up and start shouting her maiden speech at Laura Keunsberg.
Comment3	Totally illogical. She wants to leave the UK but stay in the EU. How is that independence.
Comment4	tbf the only reason I want them to stay so we don&#39;t have to get rid of our flag....
Comment 4.1	You can keep your flag, just give us your rights.
Comment5	Is it oil and gas that is the driver behind independence?  If so, given that these are both climate changers, doesn&#39;t that make the whole thing academic in the near future?
Comment6	Jo or bojo, they&#39;re both clowns, aren&#39;t they? Must be the name.<br />She urges the SNP to drop &quot;their obsession&quot;. Like as if she would demand the Green Party to drop their environmental issues, their raison d&#39;etres... What an idiot!
Comment7	YES Scotland!
Comment8	SCOTLAND LEAVE! ❤️
Comment 8.1	Turki Alhusaini no
Comment9	Scotland wants to become more independent by staying in the European Union 😂😂😂😂 if they ever chose to seperate then build a wall. When they fails you don’t take them back. No oil, no British money. Europe won’t survive. Maybe China can by them like the are with Uganda 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Comment 9.1	Stu Morris there would be “no more exports to Britain”? Hahahahaha!!
Comment 9.2	Stu Morris haha mate who cares the pound is worth about the same as the euro now 😂😂 Brexiteers saw to that hahahaha
Comment 9.3	@Oheh84 No it isn&#39;t and how would it fare using the Euro? It would be devastating as it has been for everyone else bar Germany, don&#39;t forget there&#39;d be no more exports to Britain, you&#39;ll build that wall high lol.

Comment12	A powerful leader
Comment 12.1	Honkler the Clown Salmon, Sturgeon, a red herring. Sorry couldn’t resist. LOL
Comment 12.2	Scottish people blindly follow nationalism. Independence will fuck Scotland. They don’t care who is leading the nationalist party, they just care that someone is.
Comment13	Why are the greens making a pact with the SNP when the SNP want to run an independent Scotland based on money from fossil fuels, oil and gas?
Comment 13.1	I love all the countries in the UK and I think Nicola Sturgeon is damaging Scotland on a fool&#39;s fantasy. I could have an Irish and a Scottish passport, if one ever exists.
Comment 13.2	@Roel 1971 actually I&#39;m a Scots Irish mix born in England so I&#39;m as British as they come.
Comment 13.3	You must be english.
Comment14	If the UK stands a chance, it will rise up &amp; tear every single leftist &amp; muslim out of office &amp; exile them from the country.
Comment15	I sincerely hope Scotland will become a successful independent country. It really doesn’t need to be in UK.
Comment16	Scotland should be independent. So Wales too.
Comment 16.1	The English would support both those scenarios
Comment 16.2	Well you’re a little retarded then aren’t you. Scotland receives more tax money than it provides. If it leaves, it is truley fucked

Comment 18.2	I believe Scotland voted To remain in the U.K. and will do again .
Comment 18.3	Josh Asprey lol ok have fun trying to figure out your tax deficit. Scotland gets far more tax funding per capita then it can economically produce. Good luck trying to help all of your alcoholics on that budget...
Comment19	SNP. Against the Scottish people’s vote and the British people’s vote. Anti democracy party.
Comment 19.1	Scotland voted to stay in Uk. End of so piss off to somewhere like Russia where democracy isn’t important if you are not happy. Scots main export is moaning.
