Comment17	Dutch, what about the edge of the Craton as it passes through western Canada? there&#39;s no reports of eq&#39;s out of there! Is there any &quot;reasonable/logical&quot; answer?
Comment18	The list of States named for tampering with voting Washington Oregon and California 3 of the 10 named. All these States line Our Oceans. We&#39;re being bunched on to the Graton. Look at our Fire maps and the Navy map outlines. I don&#39;t know if that is good or bad?  A lot of water expected to jump our coastal lines. Stay away from the Oceans Move further Inland warnings posted World Wide. You need to figure out what is best for you.
Comment19	China knows our USGS is against what you say so they decided to hear you to bust the USGS
