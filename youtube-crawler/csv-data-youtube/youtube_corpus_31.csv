Comment2	😭😢💔
Comment3	BBC: Please support another war for oil.
Comment4	Why you donot show this when us army killed Syria people&#39;s.......
Comment5	Thank secretary Hillary Clinton.  She promised she would arm the Syrian alqaida rebels because they were enemies with iran.  She is clearly under the impression that alqaida did not perpetrate 911. Or she has forgiven them for murdering 4000+ Americans on September 11th 2001. It seems our ally Israel is trying to convince Americans that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Comment6	But U .S.A over there wanted to bless the country your don’t want the blessing we have to put out Any country heated U.S.A never have the blessed come from above living God we are loving country God bless

Comment 10.1	Women must have enough status and power to control their own fertility
Comment11	BBC? Turkey has officially at-least 3.7 million syrian refugees, BUT IN REALITY that number is much, much higher. WARNING! Turkey is not a super-OIL-rich-country-swimming-in-petro-dollars! And all of you western countries are always looking down on Turkey. Looking down on Turkey as a poor and none-democratic country. Then how do you expect Turkey to take care of millions upon millions of refugees like this? I feel bad for the Syrian refugees too, we all do! But if you truly think that they are being mistreated in Turkey, how about YOU OPEN YOUR DOORS SOME MORE TO THEM and get our between 5-8 millions of myriad of refugees into your own country? It&#39;s easy to sit atop your high-castle and tell others what to do. Lead by example! Most nations that are officially much more &#39;&#39;advanced&#39;&#39; and/or &#39;&#39;richer&#39;&#39; than turkey have taken in nowhere near as many refugees as Turkey has done! Yet RIGHT-WING extremism is rising in those so called western &#39;&#39;humanitarian&#39;&#39; nations at an alarming rate! Heheh, then you turn it all around and look down on the Turks for not taking proper care of refugees. Without Russia and Iran and others to stop the wars and without Turkey to take the refugees, you would be knee-deep in a sea of migrants in your own countries. If you think it&#39;s bad for you now, imagine how bad it would really be if Turkey&#39;s total sum of refugees were unleashed on your own nations.
Comment12	I have vivid memories of Syrians dancing in the streets throughout their land on 9/11 - when I visited Damascus in 2008, Westerners were made to feel unwelcome as one walked around the city - no sympathy, this is all of their making!
Comment13	orospu çocukları bizi zan altında bıraktırmaya çalışıyorlar, madem mülteciler çok sikinizde gelin paylaşalım !

Comment15	When the US steals other people&#39;s Oil it is OK and Democratic Freedom in Action.......If anyone else did the same thing , It would be Piracy and Against International Law......Satan is proud of the USA  !!
Comment16	"I made a small explanation video about the real reason why Turkey🇹🇷 invaded syria. <a href=""https://youtu.be/4tJzBdiYb7Y"">https://youtu.be/4tJzBdiYb7Y</a> I  just started this channel and wonder what you guys think of it thx for checking out if you did."
Comment17	Well, Turkey is a criminal, crooked state. A joke of a country. Erdogan is a liar and murderer. And his believers are mindless sheep.
Comment18	truly heartbreaking
Comment19	Yeah CNN blame the shit created by America and Israel on turkey...👏👏👏
Comment20	Of course Turkey is evil for what they are doing in Syria. But USA and UK are so innocent. They left 2 million muslims dead in Iraq for WMD which weren&#39;t even there. That can be justified yes because it was USA and the pets (UK, EU etc.) who killed 2 million muslims. But when it comes to Turkey, yes please say it with me Turkey is evil and USA and the pets are innocent
