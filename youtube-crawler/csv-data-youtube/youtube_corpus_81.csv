Comment1	Don&#39;t forget to hug your nexrad technicians.
Comment2	Stumbled onto your page,  hope i didnt shake it up to much,  but thanks for the fall. I guess by what i have seen so far,  the rest should be a great trip,
Comment3	Outstanding! Sound is incredibly dynamic. It rules everything in existence. I&#39;ve ended up researching it, ever since my first curiosity about speaker systems.<br />  I&#39;ve ended up thinking of the human body, and how it is built to convert sound / frequencies, to talk with the brain (Senses: Ears hear a range; eyes see a range; voice speaks a range; nerves between each, must convert it to brain language s, btwn muscles, etc.....) = WOW!!!!!!.....<br />  [ I&#39;m convinced that cellphones mess with bug / bee  communication s!]
Comment4	1.99 ice cream at Kroger !!!<br />Yes!
Comment5	not to mention vhl coming out first before quake  could be a warning device
Comment6	dutch is either having a visual mental idea that is a leap for mankind or hes in the middle of a brain fart!<br />lol
Comment7	One more thing today... 22 volcanoes of Antarctica...why can we NOT be shown where all 90 some-odd volcanoes are on the big stupid secret map of Antarctica. History has shown that Antarctica is playing it&#39;s role as well. And why is it such a big secret? I get a lot of pleasure in asking. lol
Comment8	I MOST  MOST LOVE YOUR WORK for almost TEN YEARS
Comment9	We should be suspicious of what &quot;science&quot; initially affected our Sun thus our Earth. Search the internet for those SOHO vids of lasers striking the sun. I personally have made three guesses about this beginning of the huge coronal holes ... and none are good<br />We should be Stopping CERN, HAARP and Chemtrails.(a long list of reasons available to all of us) During our forest fires last year I could see, between the billowing clouds of smoke, they were still spraying us with Chemtrails. I am insulted, and concerned.
Comment10	I am on the North-West Coast, Vancouver Island Canada. I would love for you to mark the underwater volcanoes
Comment11	Thank you. xoxoxoxox
Comment12	Dutch there are not any metal winners,  Ph&#39;D&#39;s, or MS degrees who are smarter than  you, otherwise they would not have continued to act like idiots for the past 6 years or so!  As far as I am concerned you have a  Post Ph&#39;D degree in geology and science and beyond!
Comment13	Russia China not reporting. Or Oregon and now Washington? Governor Brown sold the State of California to China. Communism. President Trump bought us back Dec. 31, 2018. Thank You President Trump! The Bank of China crashed. Trillions of dollars in debt. Let&#39;s add Hawaii to this list of States. We&#39;re being or was being invaded. China testing Nuclear Warheads in Space set our World on fire. House and Forest fires burn 1100 degrees. From 2017 to June 2019, 2600 degrees. Rothchilds own PG&amp;E. We need to look a little further into the Rothchilds. Bill of Rights being attacked. Anybody trying to take your Bill of Right, Communism. China is a threat. We have a Treaty with Russia. So far it&#39;s working pretty good. Putin is the most important Person in Our World these days. Mr Putin is a very smart man. Only Putin can stop China. We&#39;re working with North Korea. The problem is How do we feed our People. United We Stand Divided We Fall. This is a Time All Nations Need To Come Together.
Comment14	That&#39;s gonna be hard to do. Finding someone Smarter.
Comment15	Is that why Alaska is on fire? Somebody testing? How about them circles in the sky. It&#39;s not a space ship?
