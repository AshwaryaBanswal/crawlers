Comment1	Read the Article from National Geographic regarding the tectonic plates off the Oregon Coast!
Comment2	posting this sight constantly &gt;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY = a corrupt government that does not have its people in they&#39;re best interest - even though we the people are their boss
Comment3	BOB-- cash, gold, precious gems. SHOES AND HELMETS. Protection from the top of your head to the tips of your toes.
Comment4	Just keeps raining in middle america.
Comment5	These earthquakes, the fires, noctilucent cloud sightings,  strange trumpet sounds around the globe, severe weather events, are ominous signs to what is happening to our biosphere, our climate is collapsing. Several feedback loops are triggered. Zero hour for human life 2026
Comment6	Secondly, we need to pay the heck attention to really where North end of Garlock goes because it was definitely involved in the 7.1e/q.  Wired magazine had an article that North end of Garlock must go back up CA basically to Southeastern Oregon to reach the sea. We have already witnessed that sequence July 3rd,2019, center of the Great Valley. Someone else speculated Susanville, which in their calculation the fault hugs the Western Sierras and then joins E/W faulting to the coast. but that does not account for the faulting radiating out from Sutter Butte volcano, dead center of Great Valley. Pay attention to magma hotspots.
Comment7	This for the USGS quagma trolls lurking on Dutch&#39;s site:  Walker Lane was renamed to all intents and purposes the ECSZ (&quot;The eastern California shear zone is the portion of the Walker Lane that extends south from Owens Valley, and continues across and south of the Garlock Fault, across the Mojave Desert to the San Andreas Fault.&quot;) The Long Valley caldera is in &quot;the region of transtensional tectonics&quot; related to Walker Lane and the Eastern California Shear Zone which incl. the Little Lake fault zone which runs through China Lake area. What USGS won&#39;t say out loud is that means the Long Valley magma doesn&#39;t stay in Long Valley caldera (why would it) it will run wherever it finds a pathway. Since the 7.1 so many new geo articles end up saying &quot;we don&#39;t know everything about these faults&quot; &quot;we&#39;re discovering new ones every day&quot; which is doublespeak, as   Clear Lake is likely sitting on top of magma, as well as anything else NWS put there, and the geothermal activity they keep insisting is the only hot thing going on is not. The reputed sighting of magma on Argus peak by locals is more anecdotal evidence. So USGS, I personally am not buying what you&#39;re  selling.
