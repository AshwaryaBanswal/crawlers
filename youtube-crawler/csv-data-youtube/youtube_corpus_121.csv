The eu country&#39;&#39;s forget, that Great Brittain whas one of the country&#39;s that set us freen from Nazi Germany in 1945, The EU country&#39;&#39;s are Rude and Associal, Manipulateted, and Arrogant against the brittisch people, and the EU Act as the EARN Great Brittain, they are the Boss, not th brittisch politicians and citizens, We in the Netherlands want also a Nexit, out of the EU , this show, that called theEU has to stop, theres a hidden government in the EU the so called: New World Order, NWO who will be rule over the EU and the world, and what did Hitler want in 1940-1945? YES the same, One great EU and he would be rule over it, now its the same scenario, the EU is ruled by Brussel, not the countrys themself , the EU decide what countrys has to do, what ther politic starategy is, not the countrys self, so the EU IS FASCISM!!! RULED BY THE RICH, \NOT BY THE PEOPLE, so Brittain. be wise, LEAVE the EU. Many will follow.make Brittain Great again.
Comment6	Its long past due, a democratic union only works with a common language and culture, as the nation state is an extension of family, if you can&#39;t even understand each other without translators and your media is all silo&#39;d off from one another, there is no common civil discourse, its simply divide and conquer by the elites, basically totally unaccountable rule from afar.  This is why the american founders gave their people arms, and this is why yours took them from you.
Comment7	Mr Blobby Johnson of the Sods Law Party, vote for Catch 22 Lib Dems or Hobsons Choice Labour? No vote for Monster-Get-Pissed-Fast-Raving-Hot-Iron-Queen-Loony-Binstitutionalised Party instead - it&#39;d make more sense?
Comment8	Exit to destruction - No Brexit!  Promises are worthless words leading to chaos.

Comment13	Brexit has spotlighted just how INCOMPETENT these MP CLOWN&#39;S in Westminster are, and they pull 77 Grand a Year for doing NOTHING that we the electorate voted them in to DO ??? how&#39;s that for a kick in the teeth.

Comment27	Failed intent to capture el chapos son Mexico won Nancy Pelosi lost

Comment28	THE WORKERS PARTY IS  MAKING  POLITICAL POLITICS WISHING TO PREVENT BREXIT DEALS FROM HAPPEN  UNDER FALSE PRETEXTS. IT&#39;S  INELEGANT
Comment29	Great deal
Comment30	Tony Benn, Dennis Skinner and other far left politicians ( plus lefty miner&#39;s leader Arthur Scargill AND Corbyn before he became leader ) all wanted OUT of the EU because they said it WAS UNDEMOCRATIC. WHY is this fact constantly omitted? BREXIT isn&#39;t a &#39;right-wing&#39;, &#39;little Englander&#39; thing, this goes beyond the phoney left-right paradigm. This is about DEMOCRACY and the EU is anything but democratic.
Comment31	leave！leave！leave！
Comment 31.1	We the eu say plase please please do leave but you are not 😳
Comment32	Watching Parliament, and want to comment.  Anna Soubry, traitor!  Antoinette Sandbach,  nothing to say about her, as per her mothers advice. I can&#39;t say anything nice about her, so I won&#39;t say anything. Labour Party,  as a group they are not thinking about the country, they are trying to position themselves for the next election. But they are miscalculating,  people see thru their strategy.<br />Tory&#39;s,  not a great deal, but at least it will meet most people&#39;s test of out of the EU.  Anyone who votes against wants to remain. Anyone who want to remain is not a democrat.<br />Parliament is full of fools who think they know more than their own constituents.   That is a serious serious failure.   The people are sovereign and must be obeyed.
Comment33	The british poeple voted OUT respect the poeples view out means OUT
Comment34	UK government has to stop favoring the terrorist country Pakistan. What is wrong with British ignoring fast developing India?<br />Why British favor Pakistan?<br />Why British government is blind? <br />Are British scared of Pakistani&#39;s Terrorist&#39;s that they can attack in UK if they favour India?<br />Why can&#39;t the British understand that Kashmir is Acceded to India on 26/10/1947 ?<br />Britain can get Indians attention only if they are true to our understanding.
Comment35	Top bloke heading the eu is a bitter drunkard

Comment45	The next eu is about taxing corporations through environmental dogmas. Greta will get you
Comment46	I think they will leave because they don’t trust this lunatic in power
Comment47	Let EU pay tribute to UK
Comment48	We all know that the left will continue to move further away from classical views and moral standards and the EU leaders are very much left-wing so the farther they change the further apart they will become.
Comment49	🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿♿
Comment50	I am Italian and I do love U.K. I am really sorry for your decision to leave.
Comment 50.1	It is not Europe we have issue with in the UK we love all you guys it is simply the Unelected people running the EU we want gone. It is two seperate things buddy.
Comment 50.2	@Jigsaw John I respect your opinion but please accept the fact that I feel sorry for brexit
Comment 50.3	Loredana Tagliaferri We love Europe, but do not want to be ruled by the EU elite. And we are determined to leave. No matter what...
Comment 50.4	@Stupid Humanity Deserves To Die of course it is your decision and no, we don&#39;t want all the immigrants. Nevertheless I Feel sorry for the brexit. I consider U.K kind of homecountry. Why shouldn&#39;t I?
Comment 50.5	Our decision, though.<br />Do you want all those immigrants in Italia?
Comment51	THERESE MAY COULD NOT DO THE JOB    -------------    NEW DEAL     !SO, PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON HAS  IN PRINCIPLE  ---- DONE       !!!!THAT IS GOOD  !!CANNOT PLEASE EVERYONE      !!!!YE- GODS    !!!ANY  MORE EXTINCTION  AND WE ARE ------------ DONE   KAPUT     !!!ANOTHER  REFERRUNDUM     ?????MORE DELAY INDEED    !!!!WE ARE ALL EXHAUSTED AND SO VERY TIRED  !!!!!I AM YAWNING  !!!!IT WILL BE 33 BILLION ---- DIVORCE SETTLEMENT      ???????????THEN AFTER THAT ------- WHAT     !!!GOD ONLY KNOWS WHY THIS COUNTRY &quot; JOLLIED&quot;  INTO BEING  EUROPEAN  !!!!ITS A SENTIMENTAL VIEW BEING ALLIE&#39;S   ------ WW-1 WW-2     ???????THAT&#39;S THE PAST NOW  !!BUT WE ARE IN A CENTURY WHERE ARE EXTREMELY    &quot; MODERN&quot;ARE WE ----   ?????FROM (U.K.)
Comment52	I wonder what happened with the allegedly abundant &#39;alternative arrangements&#39;??
Comment53	Only option is to leave with no deal, otherwise with this deal we will be locked with the EU indefinitely, with Ni,<br />and no mention of May having agreed to hand over our entire Armed Forces to EU Defence control, which <br />treasonous and crazy.  No country, except our stupid Parliament, would hand over their Defence and Security<br />to a foreign country, must be revoked immediately.
Comment 53.1	@Dennis Randall 1 gullible person in the House of Lords?? well that is possible. So what answer did he get? &amp; where&#39;s my general? Is Riley the only loyal man in the army??
Comment 53.2	@Lucky Circles Then have a look at QT in the lords, Lord James of Blackheath ask a question &quot;when are we going<br />to be told the truth about our armed Forces,&quot; then was told to revoke his question , I presume he was Lying also, If<br />you can&#39;t take a look then don&#39;t bother getting back.
Comment 53.3	@Dennis Randall I doubt it, much more likely that you or the other people are lying. Or maybe there is no such person! Never heard of a Lt General Riley before....&amp; it isn&#39;t such a high rank anyway. You find me a General who says so
Comment 53.4	@Lucky Circles Just go to search above type &quot;Lt General Riley&quot; and see what he says. Would a Lt General<br />lie about something as important such as this.
Comment 53.5	@Dennis Randall In other words, it&#39;s not true. It can only be found on Youtube because it&#39;s fake
Comment54	I can&#39;t see how the checks would weaken the deal. If it&#39;s quick and efficient then it wouldn&#39;t be any loss of money. It just sounds like an excuse without reason. Nothing lasts forever and any trouble will be reformed in due time.
Comment 54.1	In addition, only 5 % of imports to N.Ireland from the UK will have an onward journey to ROI.
Comment 54.2	Oh come on. &quot;Trouble will be reformed?&quot; Is that how British people speak??
Comment55	"How does our population go from 66 million now to only 15 million in 2025?<br /><a href=""http://www.deagel.com/country/United-Kingdom_c0209.aspx"">http://www.deagel.com/country/United-Kingdom_c0209.aspx</a><br />Similar figures are projected for other western nations.<a href=""http://www.deagel.com/country/forecast.aspx"">http://www.deagel.com/country/forecast.aspx</a>"
Comment56	UK had the best deal being in the EU so why do people keep expecting to get a better deal after they leave the EU. Absolutely absurd logic. If you join a club you have more benefits then if you leave the club.
Comment 56.1	@Meaow Meaow could you post some
Comment 56.2	@Joshua Swallow See my responses that lists 98 benefits of being in the EU.
Comment 56.3	what benefits does the UK have in the EU ? only one I can think of is free travel
Comment57	BBC is so damn biased! Losing any BIG GOV is anti BIG GOV BBC!
Comment58	...How about “Countdown to Chaos”?
Comment59	"Wonder where all the people are going to disappear to by the year 2025?<br /><a href=""http://www.deagel.com/country/forecast.aspx"">http://www.deagel.com/country/forecast.aspx</a>"
Comment60	As an American I&#39;ve heard &quot;Brexit&quot; alot but with everything going on here in the states I haven&#39;t had an opportunity to learn much about it. From what little I know of it it sounds like a very difficult decision to make and I hope the best for the people of the UK.
Comment 60.1	Trump will soon get you guys from North America
Comment61	Boris Johnsons deal is Theresa Mays  surrender deal repackaged it&#39;s not brexit.
Comment62	Guy Fawkes got his fame because of what&#39;s happening now.........
Comment 62.1	V For Vendetta.
Comment63	If Britain leaves , David and Patel will still let all their countrymen into the UK.
Comment 63.1	@pauk That&#39;s the conservatives for you , full of racist Pakistanis.
Comment 63.2	Yeah that&#39;s my favourite about Brexit. Even if it happens it will means more immigrants from non-EU countries due to the restrictions the EU places on this. So all the racists are actually helping make the country more diverse. Thanks Brexiteers!
Comment64	Suspicious:  &quot;lobbying&quot; as in back one side or the other in exchange for WHAT?
Comment 64.1	Ordinary Brits should be very wary of what has been promised....I don&#39;t trust Johnson at all....
Comment65	MP&#39;s voted against a No-deal Brexit<br />the same will now vote against the deal <br />result = Bercow and Corbyn will succeed in annihilating Brexit!
Comment 65.1	@Adrian Hutabarat I WILL believe it ONLY when I see it !!!
Comment 65.2	Johnson said the 31st, deal or no deal so it&#39;s going to happen.
Comment 65.3	Johnsons deal is not brexit.
Comment66	So does he say after every haircut, “Perfect...”?
Comment 66.1	You ever tried Brushing Straw ?? Its not his fault he is The Boris Leave our PM alone ;)
Comment67	This deal is not Brexit EU LAW can still override U.K. law . Boris you are a traitor to the PEOPLE . It is now obvious the only party is the Brexit party.
Comment68	IF THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT IMPLEMENT THE REFERENDUM THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE REPLACED BY THE BREXIT PARTY. WE MUST RESTORE DEMOCRACY &amp; LEAVE THE EU
Comment69	&#39;Before or prior to&#39;.<br />Not &#39;ahead of&#39;!!!!!!!
Comment70	BRAKING NEWS, the BBC have just posted a balanced news broadcast. (Except for the &quot;risk of the union&quot; rubbish. We are leaving with a no deal brexit on the 31st and it will be brilliant. But Mark Carney is a moron and a liar, obviously a remainer and in the EUs pocket. WTO is the best way forward and there will be no economic disasters it will be all fine, don&#39;t fall for their scare tactics.
Comment71	ALL WE NEED IS BEER AT A BARGAIN DEAL FROM THE EU AND NOTHING ELSE 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Comment72	&quot;Leave means not to leave&quot;.<br />Hypocrites.
Comment73	It&#39;s a great deal we need leave we voted we won we need leave
Comment 73.1	​@karaoke king How is it a great deal?
Comment 73.2	It&#39;s the same thing in life we make decisions  we have to live with the consequences leave means leave
Comment 73.3	Even edited that is a moronic abortion of a sentence.
Comment74	Clown act will sell out the union and the country for self glory ! Prepare for disaster if it happens, poor uk citizens ! Eu want them gtfo faster but they cant leave all he time, boris now going to partner with putler ,maduro and kim jong un, good luck team of outcasts ! Here only putler bot farm workers wana leave poor beggars who work for food !))
Comment 74.1	How much do they pay you lul
Comment75	Let&#39;s just leave deal or no deal, though this deal stinks. We have only negotiationed the beginning of our future relationship with the EU. Not anything concrete.
Comment 75.1	This deal is totally unexceptable , we voted leave . Whilst EU law overrides U.K. law it can not be excepted.
Comment76	Any deal that passes parliament is probably not good for the people or for Britain’s true independence from the EU because their are mostly remainers.
Comment77	I think Mary craeg will be jobless after next election
Comment78	You british fish and chips suckers will bow down front of Xi the great gran leader. China will kick your asses stay out of Hong Kong
Comment 78.1	@Lavalambtron we will enslave you with your economy
Comment 78.2	UNiCoRn PeGaSuS could you please stay out of europe then? And don’t come buying our utility companies to then raises prices tenfold and behave like nazis controlling every minute detail so that you can suck that last cent.
Comment79	The people started all this is now doing what???
Comment 79.1	start to starve and soon hang boris
Comment80	What is the so called deal. EU still wants UK to pay them £39 Billion plus and they, the EU still make rules for you to abide by. Goodness a great nation as the British allowed and still allowing others to govern them like this is unbelievable. Hitler is laughing from his grave for many years now. Do you forget, you are Great Britain.
Comment81	We’re the uk the EU need us more then we need them America already have a deal ready to deal with us
Comment82	So what if Boris can&#39;t get those 320 votes
Comment 82.1	More chaos
Comment83	It’s funny that people think it’s over when u agree, u will have to do negotiations with the EU and the world, and u don’t even have the negotiators yet. Let’s see how u feel when u have 10 years of that to get to 90% of what u had.
Comment 83.1	Oh fuck off you beta leftist
Comment84	MY DOUBLE VOTE <br /><br />FUCK OFF

Comment91	I’m wondering if we should actually leave?
Comment 91.1	Brexit yes........Monday only!
Comment 91.2	Livija Livija so ur saying the Eu wants Britain to leave the Eu if u are saying that u clearly are stupid and yr opinion is pointless all the Eu leaders always start a brexit speech with “regrettably the uk has chosen to leave the union” and the uk leaving the Eu is the equivalent of nearly half of the other countries leaving (13) the Eu
Comment 91.3	// smew // So is it xenophobic to not like the changing of my hometown from a lovely English country town to a neon lit town with over fifty EU style shops, with the main thing sold being Alcohol so instead of just idiot English getting drunk in Pubs we now have foreign nationals on the streets drinking doing much worse ? Free movement destroyed England no matter what your bias is, it&#39;s obvious just by going to places like Lincolnshire.
Comment 91.4	diesel92kj1 see from what i’m hearing, it sounds like you’re a stubborn xenophobic prick who doesn’t know what the nature of the EU even is
Comment92	we want brexit
Comment93	Look UK.<br />Can we just please leave now.<br />It&#39;s been Years.
Comment 93.1	I’m begging we leave 😉
Comment 93.2	This will go on 4 many many years, deal or no deal.

Comment 94.1	NO   SHRINKG  WE  WILL LIBERATE OUR   LAND  UNTILL ELBA  RIVER  FROM YOUR NAZI NATO ISIS TALMUDIC THERORIST  TRASH....LOVE  FROM MOTHER  SERBIA
Comment95	If remaining is better for my family, then I would chose to remain, regardless of the vote.
Comment 95.1	Liam coghlan <br />Not voting = letting others to decide. It has been this way since the time of Athenian Democracy<br />Edit:<br />It’s ok man. UK as a whole has decided to jump off a cliff. Jump with your countryman. It is only right.
Comment 95.2	@Königstiger though leave got the most votes, it is still not the majority of the entire country. And a lot of voters, leave or remain, simply do not care all that much about the whole thing as others might.
Comment 95.3	For the sake of democracy, UK must leave. I believe it will be a disaster but the people as a whole has decided to take this path. The will of the people is supreme.
