Comment9	Thank you Copper ml, Thanks Dutchman! The Bees in the South Bay are suffering worse than I&#39;ve ever seen, especially the larger bumble varieties. They are landing and walking around, besides GMO and Pesticides could we be seeing a behavior change due to increased VLF and also the introduction of 5G cell mast transponders? Those things are being put up everywhere in LA.<br />We are selling up and buying a small farm in the desert.<br />Love everyone in this community, be well,<br />David ☮💜🌎♾
