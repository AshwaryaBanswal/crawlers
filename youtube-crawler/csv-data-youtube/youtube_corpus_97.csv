Comment1	Does Yew-ESS-GEEE-ESSS ever bother splaining the changes they publish? Do any of the other agencies downgrade THEIR reported numbers to match??

Comment8	It should be a felony to wear a pastel aloha shirt. At the tourist shops here on the Big Island about 20 years ago, they actually started selling aloha shirts with the print turned inside out to &#39;tone them down&#39;. I imagine the USGS did the same thing to avoid improving their skills with geophysics.
Comment9	The article about the fake usgs whistleblower was from a right wing media conspiracy sute.  I should have known usgs=FAKE NEWS
Comment10	Maybe they have to reduce the earthquake scale so that when the really huge 12.0 +++ ones get here, they will still be able to fit them into the Richter scale.
