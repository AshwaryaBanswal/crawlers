Comment1	bbc where will you relocate your office in japan?
Comment2	Resist IdenTity politics tyranny
Comment3	666 = FOX = Key, if you were thinking about Fushimi Inari in Japan, what is the reason for the statue of a fox with a key in your mouth? I thought.<br />Is there anything in common between the Bible and Shinto?<br /><br />I&#39;ve been thinking for a long time about Yosako Isoran, cult religion, money laundering, and Japanese performing arts with many Koreans and North Koreans. Their name is Japanese.<br /><br />I am now assuming that these connections may be due to nuclear rights, outside the country.<br /><br />Assuming that, I investigated the meaning of the word “Nuclear Village” and NHK announcers arrested for molesting, and found out interesting things.<br /><br />Still, there are people who are talking safely about nuclear power.<br /><br />It looks like a lyric song sung by a narcissistic man who says, “I will pray for your happiness from far away!” I think sincere action and money are more important than prayer. Let&#39;s consider the Mandelfleming model.<br /><br />ｅｄｄｉｉｅ５５　ｈ／ｗｈｙ＝ｙｈｗｈ＝３６０°

Comment16	Didn&#39;t I say don&#39;t bother reporting it unless it&#39;s a lot de;,ad not 40 de;,ad and I definitely don&#39;t wanna see news with just 10 de;,ad! You might as well leave the ja;,ps out of this! I think you&#39;ve done enough! Just you the bla;,cks and the arabs! Let me show you how it went down over the past 8 years and lol you definitely won&#39;t be coming out of hell. Basically the wh;,ites hold bla;,cks higher than me the prophesied Mahdi!! That&#39;s pretty fu;,ck;,ing offensive!  The arabs are arabizers and the ni;,gg;,ers ni;,gg;,er out!!! but the whi;,tes wow you&#39;re the icing on the cake! They believe themselves superior still after being fully aware of who I am &quot;the prophesied Mahdi&quot;. When I take charge of my own people the arabs and I will &quot;just as Moses did his own people&quot;  Your white converts will never be allowed in my presence and they&#39;ll be humiliated if they try clinging to me and my people! white converts only convert because they think arabs worship them, whites also convert for the muslim generosity. I wanna see your whites humiliated every day for 8 years minimum before you leave this world and enter the foul pit forever.
