Comment21	Actually Monarchy is just an heritage which should have to end in modern society. I wish they would abolish old monarchy, although it is constitutional. Not only for the British people but also for the House of Windsor. The life as a loyal have a lot of limitations from their clothes to rules. I think it would make them stressful.

Comment 34.1	@Rubén Micaelo said by a Mannerless European who&#39;s ancestors slaughtered millions of people ruthlessly, just for living in peace...
Comment 34.2	Because thats exactly what it is! All they’re doing is acting out FANTASY! It’s a CULT! That just so happens to control the world... the QUEEN and the royal family OWN everything including you and me... that’s why they created AMERICA to take over the main duties so they can play dress up doll house... but don’t worry just keep on WAR-KING like a good citizen and pay your taxes... it’s so worth it!

Comment57	I didn&#39;t scroll down to the comments, just wrote this. Because I knew it&#39;s full of idiots who want the beautiful monarchy abolished. Don&#39;t. Do. That. Blunder. We Indians abolished our princely states in 1947. I regret that. Because we wouldn&#39;t have to keep up with corrupt politicians who won&#39;t even fix potholes that have taken many lives. But here comes the million dollar question. If we did decide to keep a monarchial form of government, out of more than 400 Royal Houses, which one would ultimately rule?

Comment 81.1	Right chutiya british
Comment82	Wow. The Queen
Comment83	When you mention Queen people now immediately think of Freddy Mercury, now he was able to put on a show and &quot;perform&quot; ,I think the only message the Queen sends out is to other pensioners &quot; with money there is no need to suffer the indignities of being poor and humble.
Comment84	I cringed when I saw Camilla it should have been Diana. It&#39;s obvious that Charles will make her the queen when time comes. What an embarrasment🤭
Comment 84.1	@Julie Newman Yeah when she found out the Camilla and Charles continue to cheat on her, Camilla and Charles were both married to other people. Camilla will always be a home wrecker.
Comment 84.2	Seriously Diana wasnt all prim and proper she had a affair with James Hewitt. Also it takes two to tango. Charles was in love with Camilla before he met Diana.

Comment 95.1	I respectfully disagree.  The moment the divorce was final, she became &quot;A Princess of Wales&quot;.  THE Princess of Wales is whomever The P.O.W. is currently married to.
Comment 95.2	For your kind information That isn&#39;t princess of wales.... Camilla is Duchess of Cornwall... Diana was princess of wales...
Comment96	Someone please tell the queen we have cars now

Comment 108.1	@Arsalan Hasan Charles will live a long life.  I don&#39;t know about Camilla but Charles will.
Comment 108.2	@Arsalan Hasan you want him to die for a throne? That&#39;s some harsh words there
Comment 108.3	@Arsalan Hasan you are not alone in thinking that!
Comment 108.4	I so want him to die first before the Queen so the throne directly transfer to William.
Comment 108.5	Yeah! The elder son you&#39;re right .
Comment109	A disgusting country, even proud of having a king in 2019, is simply a shame on the human democratic system.

Comment 112.1	@Ganesh Misal though i agree with you, she came to the Throne after Indian Independence
Comment 112.2	99 % of Britain young generation are unaware of their evil past but we can&#39;t blame current generation for that ,but she was queen when they were colonizing India ,still no apologies from her side
Comment 112.3	@Vearofo paid money ??? Wait a second did you how much great Britain owns India ??? 8 trillion ,and what about millions of people life what you gone give about that ??? Your lifes ?? You said they give some aid ?? Government of India spends more money on subsidy of fretilzers than your aid
Comment 112.4	@Ganesh Misal england once conquered america , japan tried to conquer korea . France did colonize morocco for 50 years and ban it&#39;s king . But instead of thinking about the past . These countries move on . <br />And yes they are crimes and european countries know that 100% they apologized for it and payed those colonies money.
Comment 112.5	@Vearofo yes that&#39;s biggest crimes happened in modern era and colonization was biggest crime in our history

Comment117	All that stuff... what a waste of money.
Comment118	The Queen and entire monarchy are useless. We are not bees or ants we don&#39;t want some pompous  shoithead telling us anything anymore.
Comment 118.1	No not really as they bring in  £500million  through tourist attractions.  She didnt ask to be born in the royal family. She is 95 and still attending these ceremonies and you get lazy scum who cant even be bothered to get a job who spend their benefits  on booze, fags, 49 inch tvs, bringing kids into this world that they cant support and rely on the tax payer to pay for them. The tax payer pay pittance to the toyal family. Also she doesnt get someone to wipe her arse that was Henry viii that did that. 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Comment 118.2	Josh Charlie perspectives Josh. Retrospect is always the best perspective I think. I see a history of one person who is supposed to be neutral and non interfering rewrite and amend many countries constitutions to entrench monarchy democracy. A long suffering sweet little old lady face is the mask of the tyrant beneath. On paper and through the whips and crown gaslighters we are shaped to see the monarchy democracy world commonwealth system of rule as mankinds only safe solution. <br /><br />If we are to continue logical and intelligent bandying back and forth, rather than my persecutions and your platitudes, I will, as best as I can provide proof that they have done more damage than good. <br /><br />Fact: They, the monarchy and those other elites who keep it up and running, are by definition the same elite people we all complain about that are trying to implement their wacky agenda. Always have been are and always will be. <br /><br />Count Philip of Greece designed and ran the WWF, the World Wildlife Fund where a world wide media campaign ran for years pulling in untold sums of cash. The world was lied to and all the while we happily sent off donations to help save animals, in fact the WWF  was a scam. Philip used the funds to finance his bizarre big game hunts. <br /><br />Some of the most disgusting notorious sex degenerates ever seen have are and will be protected by the monarchy and some have even been knighted.<br /><br />I&#39;ll start with just those two very true and verifiable statements. I have a very long list of monarchy debauchery and dark deeds.
Comment 118.3	Anthony Quantrill not at all. I can be highly critical of the system of monarchy in the modern world. But that does not withstand the outstanding contribution to the country and beyond that the Queen has made. That in itself warrants respect, regardless if you are in favour of republicanism or a monarchy.
Comment 118.4	Josh Charlie your very encompassing with your declarations. I believe you are so enraptured by the romance of it all that you are incapable of true critical thinking.
Comment 118.5	sb.1264 cannot be criticised? Clearly you have a shorter memory then I do. The Queen is open to criticism and has been all her life - of course she withholds publicly her opinion, that’s WHY she is such a good head of state. Anyone else within that role would have  faltered long ago. But if you imagine that she has had no impact in the background then you are deluded - she has been a pillar of stability for this country and beyond for decades. Interesting that you see service only if it implies hardship on an economic level. Yes the Queen doesn’t have to worry if she will eat tomorrow, but she has a number of justifiable concerns that are NOT insignificant and which impact a vast and greater number of people. She is as much a prisoner of her circumstances as anyone else, regardless of the benefits that come with her position. She can’t do as she pleases, she’s dedicated her life to the country. If you can’t see it from that perspective then I genuinely don’t think you’ve given it the thought it deserves beyond the position which you are so clearly attached to.
Comment119	queen should exercise more power..should interfere in internal politics ..Brexit issue should be addressed by her..
Comment120	Lizards
Comment121	We all know what the Royals represent don&#39;t we?<br /><br />At some point in history there was a saying - &quot;The sun never sets on England&quot; - this was to reflect all the land their subjects &quot;conquered&quot; around the world.<br /><br />Knowing that, many of us still go along with the culture
Comment 121.1	@Bro, Do I look stoned? all empires.
Comment 121.2	Same can be said with the spanish empire.
Comment122	Wonder if it’s bumpy ride in the Royal coach?
Comment 122.1	They sway about because the body is suspended from leather straps.  It&#39;s a bit like being on a boat.
Comment123	I just watched this again and awful, bowing and scraping to another human being. Talk about primitive behaviour in this new century. I would rather put me boot up the backside of the lot of them do a Cromwell, and get them to do a decent days work. Talk about banning religion when the religion of idolatry of sinful people, especially like this one whom Savile never bowed down to but provided children for.
Comment 123.1	@sb.1264  Nice to hear from someone equality understanding that we are all the same, one race, human race. I cannot stand pomposity.
Comment 123.2	Planet Rich Exactly! I will never understand why these people are viewed with so much fascination  when they are human beings just like us. How utterly ridiculous.
Comment124	The Imperial Emperor Edelgard Von Hresvelg is the only monarch for me. You can keep ur dusty old Queen, my Empress charges the battlefield in armor from head to toe!

Comment 128.5	well，some still take a ride in carriage
Comment129	I wish William can take over....I feel bad that she can’t retire in her age...
Comment 129.1	Queen Elizabeth that’s just sad ...I feel bad for her...I hope she isn’t overwhelmed and enjoys everything
Comment 129.2	M Scott she couldn&#39;t. She made a solemn promise at her coronation and she must keep it. The good reputation of her entire reign would be in danger if she abdicated.<br />PS: Edward VIII could abdicate only because he hadn&#39;t been crowned and anointed.
Comment 129.3	M Scott that’s sad...
Comment 129.4	She could if she wanted to.  However, at the age of 21 she publicly promised to serve until the end of her life.
Comment130	I just love this ! So beautiful and elegant. Long live the Queen!!!!

Comment134	The Queen is my favorite royal 👑
Comment 134.1	mel grant Then why did you comment on another comment saying that William should be king instead of Charles?
Comment 134.2	People who support and believe a “royal” family even exist are the reason they are keeping up with the pantomime. All actors in fancy dress.
Comment 134.3	I can&#39;t imagine anyone having a favourite royal. I don&#39;t like any of them!
Comment 134.4	Be careful she can move in any direction
Comment135	The Good people of the world can see how this evil people are. Queen Elizabeth of England and British government the blood of innocent people of biafra is crying in your hand. do you see your spech that UK will leave EU but you backing Nigeria government to kill Christian biafra. which you know that they have do to be free from Nigeria.

Comment143	Let Africa go🍽
Comment 143.1	And how is it going to help Africa that she donates all her money if that would not even cover 5% of the needs ????
Comment144	We still have royals at this time and age??!! We are so backwards and outdated
Comment 144.1	@Helio Cardoso i do agree. We need intelligence so that people don&#39;t speak shit about a political system of which they are clueless. And we need values so that people don&#39;t start name calling their opponents( like implying they are less intelligent), when they can&#39;t substantiate their arguments with logic and historical data.
Comment 144.2	@Raunak Chatterjee we don&#39;t need a revolution, we need an evolution of values and intelligence.<br /><br />Me giving you a break? You&#39;re the one writing on my initial comment lol
Comment 144.3	@Helio Cardoso and yes can be removed ASAP with a simple referendum.<br /><br />So kindly give me a break.
Comment 144.4	@Helio Cardoso well lemme sum up my points, they NEVER perpetuated apartheid or racism, had no extra role colonisation than anybody else, perperaute no value in the post war world, found in countries that have less income equality and higher standard of living, works well to be a non partisan head of state, provide as a source of national pride, prevents the rise of far left/right ideology,  has zero influence over core governmental policy, provides continuity and has evolved well with time. And if you are so salty with hereditary privilege why don&#39;t you stop using YouTube and prepare for an armed proletarian revolution instead? Bye.
Comment 144.5	@Raunak Chatterjee Not all institutions evolve, many have gone away and no longer exist.<br /><br />What I have been trying to tell you is that they are part of the century old problems we still have today along with the value system they perpetuate (they are part of the problem along with many other things).<br /><br />These individuals are far from being harmless. Just look at how they live, why can they afford such a high life standard whereas most people in the UK cannot?<br /><br />Well maybe it&#39;s because their family stole other people&#39;s wealth, which enabled them to now be in their particular position in society. Yet some people really believe we are all born equal and with equal opportunities.<br /><br />If that isn&#39;t inequality then I don&#39;t know what is.<br /><br />Well the Monarchs would be pleased if we all thought that, because it helps maintain their position in society.<br /><br />Whether you can see that or not, I have no option on that.
Comment145	Shes a remarkable woman i wish she was my grandma lol
Comment146	Was bist du für eine Egoistin! Willst du warten bis zu auseinanderfällst! Mach bloß kein Platz für Prinz Charles! Alte Rabenmutter!

She told his husband Charles will keep PM Boris still in England not resign and King Charles will destory Beixit and EUROPEAN union flags and support TRUMP victory !!
Comment152	The British Empire should rule over the EU given that the Queen is of German blood.

Comment154	That Golden Coach the Queen is in is SOOOOOOO Good Looking!!!
Comment 154.1	@M Scott still belongs in the past
Comment 154.2	@mel grant It isn&#39;t though.  It was made for the Diamond Jubilee in 2012.
Comment 154.3	Looks ancient
Comment155	What a joke 😂 how&#39;s Brexit going on? But yeah, thank you UK for making a laughing stock out of yourself.
Comment 155.1	@Raunak Chatterjee I will take poverty instead of people getting killed in my state which is happening in your state in broad daylight. We can eradicate poverty with collective efforts by our govt and citizens. Not like you people who are loudmouth and just like you&#39;re being loudmouth about poverty in North India as if the your state isn&#39;t suffering from the same. And talking about corruption, well its a problem and it will also go away with the help of technology, digitization of govt and other official works. But then again there is no point telling some Bengali loudmouth like you about all this. Actually there is no point talking with Bengalis. Keep winning the Nobel prize. As if anyone give two shit about it or you people anymore.
Comment 155.2	@Akash Kumar and do you even realise all those regional regiment were formed before independence, with groups that were loyal to the colonial administration? Ever heard the name of General Jayanto Chowdhury and General Shankar Nath Chowdhury, bengalis who lead all the army staffs? And don&#39;t be so jealous about the noble. It is getting palpable.
Comment 155.3	@Akash Kumar well i do agree that you Hindi Belt people are running the country, that pretty much explains our high corruption indices.<br />And despite all your rant about development and stuffs like that, both Bihar and UP ranks last in the list of indian states ranked by per capita GDP. So while you guys run the country  the people of your states live in abject poverty, what a shame indeed.

Comment 165.2	Just like in Saudi Arabia,  Kuwait,  Qatar, Jordan 😂
Comment166	The Government should pass a law granting The Sovereign more political power. Period.
Comment 166.1	@Michael C Who is going to stop The Queen from walking into Parliament with the British Army and dissolving Parliament that way?
Comment 166.2	Monarchs  should be  able  to  execute  orders,     which then  Parliament  will  have to  constitutionally  uphold.                 Monarchs are better equipped ,   since they  are in the role   for decades   +   have  long relationships   with world leaders.                        Also institute  abdication  at  75,        like the   Dutch do.
Comment 166.3	Revoke the Fixed Terms Act of 2011 which robbed the Sovereign the power to dissolve Parliament!
Comment 166.4	Actually... The monacrh long ago deligate powers to the parliament to be the head of government and shall have the right govern the land while the monarch retain the rights to be head of state and to be the ceremony head of UK and shall have the power to  dissolve  parliament if he\she so choose to

Comment190	I see that Charles is taking the place of his dead father
Comment 190.1	@M Scott I would be honestly grateful if you could mention just one.  I am not against him, even though he is a worthless food eater, but as long as he does not attend the likes of the meeting with Trump, attend parliament, is not seen or heard of in the Kia fiction, I have to accept he is no more on this planet.
Comment 190.2	@Planet Rich He has been at family events, some of which have been televised.
Comment 190.3	@M Scott There is every proof he is dead, deceased, is no more.<br /><br />In the story of the Kia making mincemeat of the royal&#39;s car, Philip was not seen giving an interview, not seen in any instance, which he would have been. When Trump visited this country protocol states that Philip should have been there. Since the government declared Philip as retiring, which no one in that house does, we have not seen hair nor hide of him, and I take it when the lying, cheating, deceiving, blood thirsty government says he has retired, that means gone to his long home beyond.
Comment 190.4	His father isn&#39;t dead
Comment 190.5	@Planet Rich agree!
Comment191	I see they are still delivering bags of shit to parliament to add to the pile that is in there.
Comment192	Love the diadem.  <br />One does tire under the weight of the Imperial State Crown.
Comment 192.1	I felt you meant something else when you said &quot;one does tire under the weight of the Imperial State Crown&quot; like referring how much she has gone through in serving her nation. And trying to hold her family together.

Comment206	Arrives with the stolen crown from India 😂 Shameless
Comment 206.1	The Crown has nothing to do with India.  The diadem was made for George IV in 1821 and the Imperial State Crown for Queen Victoria in 1838.  Before our involvement with India.

Comment208	Karma always follows either instant or longer ... now many country are laughing on Britain !
Comment209	All the ceremonial stuff is well out of date. Why can’t she just turn up in a limo instead of a golden carriage. Flanked by horses and army personnel. I’m sure a few body guards wouldn’t be sufficient. Waste of tax payers money. If you ask me.ok she might pay taxes now. But they still take far more out than they pay in. Oaf with their heads
Comment 209.1	Not asking you. But for your information, as you obviously don&#39;t know, the monarchy isn&#39;t funded by the taxpayer.  It is funded by the Sovereign Grant, which comes from the private Crown Estate revenue.  The balance, £300 million pounds a year, goes to the Treasury, so the taxpayer.
Comment210	An atom of Indian wealth is on display! Marvelous
Comment 210.1	Where?

Comment 210.5	@Emperor Arcann yeah but you&#39;re glad 6 million died in WWII for French and British! Again you don&#39;t know history! Perhaps it&#39;s irrelevant to think from your point of view.

Comment215	Dynastic monarchy is incompatible with 21st century sentient humanity , The French figured this out centuries ago.   and they got it right.
Comment 215.1	No it isn&#39;t.  It puts a family at the heart of government.  A human rather than grey politicians who are now hated and discredited.

Comment 223.1	@Planet Rich when did she shut down the Australian Parliament. Lol. Sorry, but are you absolutely and completely bonkers?
Comment 223.2	@TrXl but didn&#39;t like thatcher
Comment 223.3	@TrXl Unless she is shutting down the Australian parliament, as she did some few years ago. What we know of Blanch is what is created by the press office and media. We only know that she is a free loader, and her family, in a position that is nonsense and that she likes to keep company with the Jimmy Savile&#39;s of the world as long as they can supply her with the necessary. What some do not know is that she signs death warrants in those protectorates that have the death penalty.  Where is her husband?
Comment 223.4	She probably doesn’t agree, but she likes to remain impartial on politics
Comment 223.5	You means Blanch, that old piece of child abusing shite at the Palace and her now defuncked, I have a child for you, Mam, Savile, and Epstein.
Comment224	I’m so glad we don’t have royalty in America.

Comment228	One horse is enough. Cz the queen is not that fat and heavy.  But they use 5!  Taxer money is really free.
Comment 228.1	It isn&#39;t taxpayer money.  That is a very common misconception.  The monarchy is funded by the Sovereign Grant which comes from the Crown Estate revenue.  The balance, £300 million pounds a year is paid to the Treasury, so the taxpayer.
Comment 228.2	Free wage for life
Comment229	You chop it all up into little bits! Why not just put up <b>The WHOLE THING</b> at one time, for those of us who missed it? I&#39;m not a millennial. After days and hours of watching Both Houses, I can assure you that I for one have the attention span to watch an entire Queen&#39;s Speech and <b>All</b> of the traditional ceremony. I feel badly cheated by not being able to see the entire event, and I expect <b>Far Better</b> from the BBC!!
Comment 229.1	@Roci Stone from personal experience, you can very often watch BBC news abroad (you&#39;ve just got to know where to find it on your channel list). Other bbc channels usually aren&#39;t available due to &quot;rights agreements&quot; and the same for iPlayer. The issue for them is in order to allow foreign audiences to watch all BBC content they would have to renegotiate all the viewing rights for all the content they&#39;ve ever made for all the countries on earth otherwise it would be a very limited and probably obscure range of content that you could watch. But certainly I could see them starting off with opening up to a small range of high-demand countries e.g. at least all English speaking countries
Comment 229.2	@Amin Boumerdassi OK, but this is a once a year, arguably historic event in the reign of the UK&#39;s longest-serving monarch. Three or four hours over an entire year, along with the Trooping of the colours and (we hope) the occasional royal wedding or birth can&#39;t take away that much. The point is this: The BBC is world-renowned. When people overseas or expats (like myself) want to see something like the State Opening of Parlement, the BBC is where one looks, almost by instinct alone. It seems to me that the BBC might do well to remember that not all of us who still call the UK home have it so &quot;easy&quot; as those who pay the fees back home. I&#39;ve offered, year in and out, to pay a standard licence fee in order to watch the same BBC you see in London, but they won&#39;t take money from me because no one at the BBC seems to have figured out that there is a loyal audience in America as well. If they are so up against it for money, shouldn&#39;t they take it from people who want their service, no matter where in the world they might be? To me, it really is penny wise, and pound foolish!
Comment 229.3	It&#39;s not an attention span thing. I think it&#39;s more of a legal and policy-based issue. They&#39;re not usually allowed to put extended segments on social media as it undermines the taxpayer that pays for the BBC to be fully funded and ad-free specifically through its own platform e.g it&#39;s channels and BBC iPlayer.
Comment230	SUA  MAESTA&#39;  ELISABETTA II  E&#39;  IN  OTTIMA  FORMA,  E&#39;  DAVVERO  INOSSIDABILE,  E&#39;  UNA  SUPER  REGINA  MA  SOPRATUTTO  E&#39;  UNA  SUPER  NONNA  CON  TANTI  BELLISSIMI  NIPOTINI,  LUNGA  VITA  A  SUA  MAESTA&#39;  &gt;!!!.

Comment234	Don’t forget the taxpayers who made you in gold and diamonds
Comment 234.1	M Scott I knew that.. what do you mean
Comment 234.2	The Crown Estate funds the monarchy via the Sovereign Grant, which comes from its revenue.  The balance, £300 million pounds a year, is paid to the Treasury, so the taxpayer.

Comment255	How come they went for the full pomp and ceremony this time when there hasn&#39;t even been an election?  It seems strange and you can tell she had a bit of a cold.<br /><br />In 2017 after that snap election, she did this much less formally.  She was dressed in her normal attire and arrived in the Bentley instead of the coach.
Comment 255.1	M J. This happens every year, there doesn’t need to be an election. 2017 was different, the snap election messed the hole Calendar up so they had to change the date of the state opening of parliament and because it was 4 days after the trooping of the colours there was no time to rehearse so it had to be scaled back

Comment 278.1	I dread to see the day that Charles and Camilla are crowned. Shameless couple. That is, if they even make it there at all
Comment 278.2	@magna czagany If you knew anything at all you would know that Camilla is Duchess of Cornwall....why do you even mention The Duchess of Cambridge in this context? It is perfectly normal for the Duchess of Cornwall to accompany her husband to this event as did Diana back in the day. As for Camilla&#39;s children, they won&#39;t ever be members of the royal family so why even bring up the matter?  Might I suggest you do some research and mug up on the facts before giving us the &quot;benefit&quot; of your opinions in future.
Comment 278.3	@seerjc123 unfortunately
Comment 278.4	@seerjc123 royalty through the back door no more no less
Comment 278.5	seerjc123   Duchess of Cambridge ?  That is Cathrine, Williams wife.  Charles escorted his mother the Queen because Prince Phillip has retired.  Camilla walking behind them is ridiculous has no role in Parlament and God help us will never be Q Consort.  Would you like her children to be part of the royal family ?

Comment299	Britain still enjoying respect from world countries,  because of Queen Elizabeth
Comment300	One has to admire the Queen , she represents stability even while her family descend into scandal around her even more so now that the country is so divided .
Comment 300.1	@blackham7 with Boris as President? No thanks 😂
Comment 300.2	@blackham7 Nope. A lot of money and connection came from the Monarchy. The Presence of UK solely relied on its Cultural and Historical identity. Trust me. Even if we change to Republic, it will never last bcoz of backstabber in the Parliament.👌
Comment 300.3	TrXl i completely agree, and btw I&#39;m American lol
Comment 300.4	@jooneemoon agree
Comment 300.5	You guys do realise if Britain became a Republic it would actually benefit the country.
Comment301	Sad that with her wealth of experience and the deep love for her country, she cannot even utter a word of advise to her subject..long live Your Majesty.
Comment 301.1	@eds marpu yep, I believe, because the United Kingdom isn&#39;t a Republic, it&#39;s a Constitutional Monarchy, hence every &quot;citizen&quot; of the United Kingdom is her subject. I&#39;m not from the UK so I&#39;m just stating impartial facts and I have no opinion to share.
Comment 301.2	Subjects? Seriously?

Comment 308.1	@M Scott if the queen pays us then why did we pay millions for two royal weddings this year. I think u have been sold a pack of porky pies m8
Comment 308.2	Well named.  The monarchy is not funded by the taxpayer.  The Sovereign Grant is income from the private Crown Estate.  The surplus, £300 million pounds a year, is paid to the Treasury, so the taxpayer.  The fact is that The Queen is unpaid and paying the taxpayer.
Comment 308.3	What’s the fuck has TV licence have to do with this?
Comment309	He can&#39;t not be my guard.

Comment 311.4	@mel grant Ah, I wondered when Bend Over&#39;s boyfriend would turn up and here you are! Have you left your chaiwala stall unattended?
Comment 311.5	@Peter Barton speak from experience?
Comment312	Is that Mrs. Saxe Coburg and Gotha.
Comment 312.1	@Metric Imperialist My point was that while if she bore the title Mrs as is asserted above  the norm is to adopt one&#39;s husbands name though I have to agree that she retains the right not to do so. My issue was to answer the original question  Is that Mrs. Saxe Coburg and Gotha. Of course she is not she technically doesn&#39;t have a surname but is legally in the UK, Queen Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God Queen of this Realm and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith. But if she were a commoner and the right of her grandfather to change the name of her family and house to Windsor and if her husband was not allowed to adopt his maternal uncle Earl Mountbatten or his mothers actual name Battenberg, then she would not be Saxe-Coburg and Gotha but as a married woman would be Mrs Philip Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg which was Prince Philip of Greece&#39;s Danish-Greek surname and that of his father.
Comment 312.2	@Bernardine Moran Wrong. Her full name is Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor.<br />She is the head of House Windsor. She never became a Mountbatten.
Comment 312.3	@Metric Imperialist More than likely if she was using Mrs it would be Mountbatten or Mountbatten-Windsor

This &quot;old slag&quot; as people have called her has done more for The commonwealth, ex servicemen and women, charity and the government than any of these silly lefty pricks in this comment section. If you are all so enlightend do a bit of reasearch you butt hurt prats!!!!! Oh and bbc fuck off
Comment318	Lol those door openers dont know what they were doing
Comment 318.1	@ElliotGaming The Queen is allowed anywhere in Parliament except for the House of Commons.  It is her Palace of Westminster.  Black Rod has been the monarch&#39;s representative there since 1522 when Henry VIII moved out to the Palace of Whitehall.
Comment 318.2	@ElliotGaming she is allowed in some parts of it
Comment 318.3	Mr Ed the queen isn’t actually allowed inside parliament, which she was doing here; I don’t suppose it has something to do with that

Comment328	I love seeing traditions like this and imagining the future.  the space colony has their &quot;honorary&quot; president commence the dial up modem  ritual as the hanshaking sounds start they all sit around an old CTR tv and watch static...my point is from a certain perspective. maybe one outside of time.  this is all soo silly.
Comment 328.1	@Raunak Chatterjee The police were probably deployed as crowd control. I was unaware that the PM now has a larger retinue, that does to some extent surprise me, obviously there is the potential threat from Islamic State, but at the time I was in Blackpool the IRA was extremely active.   <br /><br /><br />In fact, Major&#39;s house was only about a mile or two from the high-security prison HMP Whitemoor, it is a category A prison with a category A+ unit within. An A+ unit is for highly dangerous prisoners, generally serial killers and terrorists. Back in 1994, there was an escape of IRA terrorists from this prison. I understand that all of the IRA were freed as part of the Good Friday Agreement and now it houses IS, who seem to spend most of their time radicalising the rest of the prison population.
Comment 328.2	Well, times have changed. The PM now does move with a larger retinue of met police officers, atleast in London. Thanks for the anecdote though. <br /><br />Btw i didn&#39;t see a huge retinue of police attending. The Household Cavalry was the one who provided both the pomp and the security.
Comment 328.3	@Raunak Chatterjee Generally, the prime minister just travels around in an armoured vehicle with a close protection officer or 2. They send in the army with sniffer dogs at the venue and they will position a few rooftop snipers in case of attack at the venue. Their home is also guarded by a close protection officer.<br /><br /><br />I know this because when I studied in Blackpool, whilst John Major was at the Tory party conference he visited the college that I was studying at. Years later, when he was no longer prime minister, I worked about a mile away from his home and friends brother lived in the same road. He lived at The Finings, Green End, Great Stukeley, Huntingdonshire.
Comment 328.4	@Banana But the cost would have been same for any Head of State, Republican or Monarchial!
Comment329	Lizaerd lips! You idiots serve a fucken overgrown iguana.

Comment 330.2	We Are All Neil Lennon it’s all a matter of opinion. I admire her you don’t that’s life👍 sorry for being rude sometimes on these comments I get carried away! X
Comment 330.3	@Derek Trotter I&#39;m not bitter about anything at all I don&#39;t know how you have came to that conclusion ........I just don&#39;t see the point in any of them ..im sorry I am not meaning to be offensive its just my opinion ......
Comment 330.4	We Are All Neil Lennon your bitter, she’s an amazing lady if you can’t see that more fool you. Think she’s in it for money or status? She was dealt this card. It would be a sad day if we said abolish the monarchy she is the flagship however I worry about her predecessor. Sorry for being rude 👍
Comment 330.5	@Derek Trotter a see her for what she is ....POINTLESS
Comment331	She is beautiful,<br />I wanna be her doggie
Comment 331.1	You can be my doggie, sweetheart.
Comment 331.2	@Himanshu Yadav I see loads of people on here getting abusive and had a lot myself when I commented about equal pay in science or rather the lack of, something that I had a fair bit of personal experience of. The funny thing is, the people that were making the comments were not even in the science industry, so it was somewhat unlikely that they knew a representative cross-section at all.
Comment 331.3	@Banana <br />My mistake, That comment was for the one who wants to be her doggie. I apologize and thank you for keeping it calm and polite.
Comment 331.4	@Himanshu Yadav The dogs are not so well treated by the footmen, in fact, one of the footmen was sacked for giving alcohol to the dogs. It is a bit of an in-joke, that they are not so well treated by the poorly paid staff, who take their frustrations out on them when the royal family is not around.
Comment 331.5	@Banana Ofcourse You.
Comment332	"What happened  @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znH5Fd2eBCE&amp;t=2m48s"">2:48</a>??"
Comment 332.1	@Jorge Vargas Caporali It is easy to forget because The Queen just keeps going.  The Royal Staircase is very long.  The lift, not being made for ceremony, is by a very insignificant entrance.  The advantage is that it comes out just round the corner from the robing room.  Another nod to The Queen&#39;s age is that a prop is put against the carriage so that it rocks less on its springs when The Queen gets in and out.  I worked at Buckingham Palace for 30 years, 20 of those years in The Queen&#39;s private office, and I find it sad to see her aging.  I am 30 years younger than her and, along with her other staff always found that her energy was always greater than ours.
Comment 332.2	@M Scott : very good explanation! it has so much sense and it&#39;s quite logical considering her age, suddenly it is easy to forget that HM is 93 years old
Comment 332.3	@Jorge Vargas Caporali It wouldn&#39;t be unexpected.  The Queen doesn&#39;t walk up the Royal Staircase any more, because she is 93 and has arthritis in her knees.  The carriage goes round to another door, then The Queen takes the lift up.  She has done now for several years.
Comment 332.4	It seems HM the Queen entered through an unexpected entrance
Comment333	Love this. I need to travel like this haha 😆
Comment334	You guys don&#39;t have cars?
Comment 334.1	@WrightyPegz haha that explains it!

Comment336	Imperialism in all its glory
Comment 336.1	The imperialism almost ended at the end of the World War 2, with the fall of Nazi Deustchland and the decolonization of great part of the world. The more likely term to speak about that is monarchism.

Comment 337.3	@kingof206 More than you Mr Satan worshipper, try looking up the Commonwealth and what she has done for that alone. 53 member states will disagree with you!
Comment 337.4	@kingof206 I wouldn&#39;t call an old lady I would of say I wouldn&#39;t bow down to Queen when she gets richer her country becames poor and up for sale
Comment 337.5	@M Scott spot on

Comment339	Even third world country leaders have motor vehicles! Why she has to waste time?
Comment 339.1	Tradition and the public love it
Comment 339.2	Tradition.  Of course The Queen has cars, but carriages are generally used for this once a year event.  Maybe do your own research.
Comment 339.3	@Musthafa PM You want the queen to sit in a BMW? She&#39;s 93 years old, mate.
Comment 339.4	@CoRoys AA I&#39;m serious, waste of time, money and, what about, you don&#39;t have PETA there!?
Comment340	Why does Britain still need this show , specially if everybody knows it a fake show for Boris Johnson .Poor old Queen being forced to do all this for a old fashioned and outdated  tradition.
Comment 340.1	Don&#39;t need royalty
Comment 340.2	She’s not forced it’s her duty as monarch, aren’t most traditions old fashioned?
Comment341	Charles was all redfaced after Japan kicked ass in the rugby...also who is the grey haired woman with the cane - is she the new black rod?
Comment342	Lol, look at these third worlders getting butthurt because their country was nothing more than a slave to UK.
Comment343	The queen sucks
Comment 343.1	@Miraitowa and Someity the Frozen 2 otaku stfu, you think you&#39;re some authoritative figure. Just another dumbass on youtube
Comment 343.2	Lol no u
Comment 343.3	Please keep politics out of this.
Comment344	The illuminati leader has arrived!
Comment 344.1	@Nazi Rita Now you&#39;re just being disgusting...just stop right now...bearing in mind that the royals in the modern context do a lot of charity work and bring issues to the forefront of the media...that would otherwise not be as superfluous in our minds...hence why Britain still have a Royal family, that fits into the system, and why countries like France had their Royals heads chopped off...
Comment 344.2	@Ambient Soda she drinks the blood of white children
Comment 344.3	@Nazi Rita don&#39;t you think bullying a harmless 90yr old woman is stereo typical of a  emotionless &#39;lizard&#39;?
Comment 344.4	The Queen of lizards!
Comment345	All that gold on that cart will be getting robbed when we crash out and the war begins.
Comment 345.1	It&#39;s gilded wood, not sold gold
Comment 345.2	M Scott Naaa mate that’s we’re all our money goes. That’s ALL gold.
Comment346	Your kingdom is falling while you sit and watch mum
Comment 346.1	They don&#39;t care about the peasants
Comment 346.2	Rubbish
Comment347	Unneccesary bullshit. Tradition, the enemy of progress!
Comment348	Bogies
Comment349	Can we afford this pointless show?
Comment 349.1	@Ziolek2000 Exactly. Get them to fund themselves completely and stick them all in Buckingham Palace. They don&#39;t need Windsor Castle, Sandringham, Balmoral, Clarence House etc. which cost the taxpayer for their maintenance.
Comment 349.2	@M Scott I wonder why the taxpayer had to pay for Buckingham Palace renovations then?
Comment 349.3	@sb.1264 Agreed but you can also just keep the Royal Family completely symbolic which is not currently. I&#39;m talking 0 tax money 0 singing of laws and 0 of her stupid powers that she never uses.
Comment 349.4	M Scott There is no evidence to suggest that the royals specifically bring money into this country via tourism. Does the Queen shake the hand of every tourist in London? Do tourists come here specifically to have tea with the Queen, to meet the royals in person? Of course not. No tourist will say that they came here just because of the royal family. They want to see the architecture, appreciate our history, our beautiful landscape etc. All of which will still be here without the royals.
Comment 349.5	@J Singh where does this money from tourism go to.why is everything so cash strapped still then.
Comment350	So where is the drama queen? (mm!)
Comment351	That’s a lot.
Comment352	so much pomp and ceremony - seems so quaint and yet so ridiculous in this day and age<br />I respect the Queen as a person - she has worked in this role, esp during the war<br />prospect of Charles &amp; Camellia doing the same - different story
Comment 352.1	Exactly Julia Connell, I think I&#39;ve made my point then.
Comment 352.2	@Matt Barbarich what??  no - not familiar with the french - and at the british royals have history - like serious <i>history</i> history
Comment 352.3	Julia Connell Maybe you prefer the    pomp and ceremony of President Macron and the French Republic.
Comment353	Thief queen.. !!!<br />Give Indian diamond !!!!<br />British Raj ....Thief Raj.....
Comment 353.1	@the BOLLOCKS ours? more like theirs dumbass
Comment 353.2	Stay away from politics please,
Comment 353.3	@seerjc123 Think well , Read history and then take decision ......<br />We don&#39;t want fight with you because your not Boris Johnson or queen , history is right  British are thief&#39;s but present citizens good but they use our money ....like begger....

Comment358	Proud American here, God save The Queen!
Comment 358.1	Willskull <br /><br />Psalm 14:1-4<br />&quot;Only fools say in their hearts, &quot;There is no God.&quot; They are corrupt, and their actions are evil; not one of them does good. The LORD looks down from heaven on the entire human race; He looks to see if anyone is truly wise, if anyone seeks God. But no, all have turned away; all have become corrupt. No one does good, not a single one! Will these evil people ever learn?&quot;
Comment 358.2	Peter Livingstone fuck Nicola crankie sturgeon 😂 long live Donald boris and our queen🖕

Comment 362.3	@Hoàng Nguyên go there then 👑🇬🇧
Comment 362.4	@lorraine lane even Scotland is better than England.
Comment363	Isn’t that a bit stupid, she has to go there to read what bojo wrote. A email would do the job
Comment 363.1	She has to be in attendance
Comment 363.2	I agree. She could have done that on live broadcast for a woman her age. But oh well. As they say God Save The Queen from a broken leg, neck or fall.... (Or Not)
Comment 363.3	It&#39;s called culture .
Comment 363.4	Martin Decamerone a vlog would be nice..

Comment 366.3	@Mr Heidelberg like to see you try I would gut you like a fish, I was in British army for 25years bring it on Bosh, I suggest you actually read my comment before making threats clown.
Comment 366.4	William Peterson They still get a cut of money from the government for the maintainable of their numerous palaces and houses. You have the wool pulled over your eyes if you think that they fund themselves entirely and no taxes whatsoever go towards them. Of course they do. They are public servants. That money should go towards schools, or the NHS. Areas that desperately need money. Not towards the maintenance, renovations, and weddings of a family whose only accomplishment was being born to a particular bloodline.
Comment 366.5	@M Scott surprised. Must be the older generation
