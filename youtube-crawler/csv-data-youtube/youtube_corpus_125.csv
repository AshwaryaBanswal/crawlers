Comment1	The stupid Democrats are walking into a trap with impeachment.  President Trump could use the tu Quoque defense in the Senate by calling witnesses to testify that Omama era officials did the same things he is accused of doing.  Investigations by John Durham, Attorney General Barr and various inspectors general should be completed by then making it easier to drag the Democrats through the mud.
Comment2	I like The lying drama
Comment3	&quot;President Trump is the best thing to have happened in America. He is a great strategician.Bold, upright, shrewd, courageous, and truthful. The Democrats just want him out.They do not realise this action would permanently tarnish the office of the presidency. X cept for the democrats everyone loves and admires President Donald J Trump. He is a great leader, I quote from Richard Nixon&#39;s book &quot; Leaders and Leadership&quot;. Quote.. Management is like prose leadership is like poetry. A great manager does the things right,but a great leader does the right thing. Unquote. Wake up America... <br /> The Oldman                            <br />Former  Pakistan Air Force.    <br /><br /> Former Headmaster Aitchison College LAHORE
Comment4	Sapeenas
Comment5	The walls are closing in on Benedict Donald and the ignorant small-town societal rejects who support him. I’ll bet the Republicans are really glad they invited those Southern racist morons into their party now. They destroy everything they’re a part of, they are the world’s largest collection of Jinxes.
Comment6	FAKE news from Bias Broadcasting Corporation, all intervals are held in a skiff with only the corrupt Democrats in attendance to prevent any leaks, NO REPUBLICANS are allow to hear what is said so who leaks the information to the LYING FAKE NEWS MSM, that is right the CORRUPT DEMOCRATS.  They have no evidence of wrong doing by President Trump other wise they would proceed with the correct procedure to impeach the President.  Use the internet and you will see every person this idiot talks about are in with the corrupt Democrats.
Comment7	trump is great
Comment8	you are a very innocent and honest man. Make the water muddy. Look at what you and other people are doing using media, see what is happening to your country. I am sure you have an answer for this too. you are going to blame. That is all for this week. I hope next week you will wake up and see what you and others doing is creating more chaos. of course, it is not your fault it is their fault. Don&#39;t forget what you think is who you are and so you will receive the same treatment in life. It is what you think and it is what you will attract. Hope you will read and think about it. Hope is a word anyone, whoever can use.
Comment9	ANTHING TO GET TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE... GOD FORBID THE FIRST WORLD LEADER WHO ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT HIS PEOPLE... YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO THE ONES WHO HAVED KILLED MILLIONS...
Comment10	What happened ??? When of the rockers then dimcrats go full speed...and &quot;impeachment&quot;, come on, it holds no water whatsoever, this &quot;quest&quot; they are on is what makes politics disgusting, unethical and abusive and it was never about America or us the people, but a power grab they feel entitled to, even though they lost and their marbles as well and any dignity they might have had left!

Comment 24.1	@stanley oleyte Whys that?
Comment 24.2	Pro Skillz u must be panicking
Comment25	Giuliani should have been arrested with his 2 buddies!
Comment26	The Fake News BBC are fully aware that President Trump is not being impeached. Fact<br />That would require a vote. Fact.<br />This is irresponsible  journalism. Something the BBC do very well.<br />No wonder ex BBC employee John Humphrys called the BBC &quot;Institutional Liberal Bias&quot; &quot;Kremlin Style Corporation&quot; &quot;Out of Touch&quot;<br />The fact that the BBC will not even cover the Burisma story, just confirms the dishonesty. John Solomon has done some real journalism on this subject. Something you won&#39;t see on the Fake News BBC.
Comment 26.1	@Fenrir Drift No it&#39;s fake news. Just like the Fake Russian collusion fantasy. The Fake News BBC pushed that drivel for more than 2 years. You&#39;re living in dreamland if you think that the BBC are independent. This is a leftwing biased organisation. The amount of real news that the BBC will not cover is staggering. You must know that.
Comment 26.2	Ian Tegrity just because it don’t fall in line what Fox News says don’t mean it’s fake news, the BBC is a independent
Comment27	Will England please adopt me?
Comment28	As an American who knows how full of shit our mainstream media is, I trust news about our country from other country’s media 100000000% more than ours.
Comment29	Trump is untouchable--he is bigger than god!
Comment30	"For Americans... We all need to think! I know its hard cause we&#39;re not used to it but now we all must think. Impeachment is a unique process. Trump people say we are trying to undo a Presidential election through impeachment. Democrat people say a President withholding aid that has been approved by congress for that Presidents own personal political advantage is an abuse of power and needs to be dealt with. Both sides are correct.<br /><br /><br />There is only one question we need to think through. Is withholding aid approved by both Republican and Democrat representatives because that President thinks withholding the aid might give him a personal political edge reason enough to fire that President?<br /><br /><br />Yes or No.<br /><br /><br />It&#39;s very much in our court. Impeachment IS trial by public opinion and the bar is EXTREMELY high. Let the Senate know what you think."
Comment31	"Since Anthony is not a real journalist and just a globalist with an agenda to project on other people. I have the other side of the story for you.<br />Glen Beck interview with Ukrainian Andii Telizhenko. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R86awAp4uIw"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R86awAp4uIw</a>. Andii spills the beans on ALL the Democrats in Ukraine. Democrat corruption is far worse than we imagined."
Comment32	this background music should be impeached.
Comment 32.1	It&#39;s not about what the message is saying it&#39;s about how it makes you &quot;feel&quot;
Comment 32.2	Michael Lochlann it&#39;s kinda dulls out the bitterness
Comment33	We&#39;re already in the &quot;It&#39;s not a crime&quot; phase of denial?<br />Things are really starting to pick up.
Comment34	The BBC will burn.
Comment35	Be good. Be the one God loves. Tell everyone. On the island of İmralı.  Why don&#39;t you tell people to look for true religion? The war started. Do the following. Why don&#39;t you look for a real religion? If you die, you may suffer. Is it possible that he&#39;s not creative? How did this harmony occur in our bodies?
Comment36	The antichrist manages the world. Dajjal on the island. Abdullah Öcalan. On the island of İmralı. My Facebook address is Mustafa Muhtar. Illustrated black profile
Comment37	Who do you think will play trump in the remake? What about that Trump look alike Boris guy
Comment 37.1	Only Jim Carrey can play Trump.
Comment 37.2	Alex S. 😂😂 he is literally frumps British mini me 🤭😂
Comment38	As an American I’m just cackling finding out that y’all are watching this like a tv show with popcorn.
Comment 38.1	As an American, I’m siding with the Brit on this one.
Comment 38.2	As a Brit, I think of Trump and his White House a bit like Basil Fawlty and Fawlty Towers.<br />I was in New York the year before 9/11, and everyone was perfectly normal.<br />And 20 years later, this clown Donald is President?<br />Hard to believe.
Comment39	The only things that will be impeached is BBCs reputation. Love watching liberals dig their own graves. Keep it up and it will be you who is put to the test.
Comment40	The commoners do not understand what they do.  They keep saying to &quot;go get it in the ocean.&quot;. There are many techniques that they utilize in order to force submission into ignorance, even in this age of EZ knowledge.  You&#39;ll never figure it out, the endless alien perturbance that gets suppressed and transferred into many perturbances, sometimes treated as paranormal activity, sometimes completely contained by axioms and inauthentic catalogs.  The common man has been a lost cause, non clinically insane, enforcing the role of an adult child, all while pretending to imitate shallow adult responsibilities.
Comment41	An impeachment is to go through the judicial committee and is supposed to be open to the public. not happening. They are not allowing the whistleblower to be questioned by Republicans. All illegal and the American public isn&#39;t buying it. This is another Russian Hoax and there will be a reckoning for Democrats in 2020.
Comment42	Are there no consequences to refusing to comply to subpoenas?
Comment43	Whatever the BBC has to say about politics, I know it&#39;s full of crap before even watching.<br />You&#39;re about as bad as CNN for trying to push a narrative instead of finding out the narrative<br />shameful shameful performance
Comment 43.1	​@Youhaw Redrum well i dont know for certain who is controlling them; but both the EU and the BBC definitely seem to part of the same agenda absolutely. <br /><br />nothing against the idea; but there is so much disinformation i am skeptical on either side of any claim about russia lately
Comment44	You know, on a slightly different topic, every President has at least one great, or &quot;historical&quot; speech in his presidential career. Even G W Bush... I think. I wonder which &quot;great&quot; speech will be remembered from Trump... lol
Comment 44.1	OG Sound FX He making America great again
Comment45	Your so convenient you break it down so simple beautiful
Comment 45.1	But its not that simple most of those things are takeing out of context never believe anything you haven&#39;t watched the entire speech or conference of. And wartched with a open mind. The left just watches everything with HATE glasses on
Comment46	It&#39;s not an inquiry untill they vote on it 👌 please stop spreading fake news

Comment49	Wow how low can the BBC get doing a piece on the kangaroo court of the demon rats...yet nothing on what Biden and his son have done funnelling millions of dollars  from the Ukraine,China and many more countries... Shame on you BBC for fake bias news...
Comment50	Looks like he tried to lay it out so even republicans should be able to understand.
Comment 50.1	@Elias DJT=RuPOS
Comment 50.2	Have you always been a progressive disease?
Comment 50.3	@Elias Thank You for your reply...DJT=RuPOS....
Comment 50.4	What I understand, as I always have, is that a Republican is not the perfect person, but a perfect person is a Republican. Go on with your probably globalist self now, philosophizing and making smart ass comments all you want. Everything else other than a Trump Republican is a progressive disease, and you are proving that.
Comment51	Except American&#39;s don&#39;t care anymore after watching the Democrats run roughshod over every rule to get their own way for 8 years. The way they see it now is; its their turn and your self righteous indignation only makes his supporters like him more. If the Democrats plan to beat Trump is to be the are the arbiters of morality I think they&#39;re in for another rude awakening.
Comment52	Unmitigated gull. The liars ball. Who do these rats think they&#39;re fooling? No one, they&#39;re just dancing the razor&#39;s edge of legality. Only very desperate criminals act like this. Look who&#39;s calling Trump a liar! Shumosi, LGBTQMSNBCABCCNN.  Have we had enough? No ! Bring it, we&#39;ll fight for our children well fight for our rights we will fight for our country and just because. Never surrender and never say die...😑
Comment53	To put it in a simple analogy, President Trump is the Road Runner and the Democrats are playing the part of Wile E. Coyote.
Comment 53.1	@jwkivy - Looking at how events have unfolded I would beg to differ.
Comment 53.2	Chump is more like the road runners mentally challenged cousin that keeps tripping himself, got caught and is about to get burnt to a crisp over his own dumpster fire.
Comment54	A very deep state slant.
Comment55	bbc if he didn&#39;t do it then make anthony do it
Comment56	not this again, for god&#39;s sake every month they bang on about Impeachment but it never happens, give it up already three years nearly now.

Comment 67.3	Waste of space bootlicker criminal apologist
Comment68	The changing changing story..changing again...lies by the corrupt pigs.
Comment69	Boring.
Comment70	Basically, this week the BBC government propaganda machine continued to support the coup to unseat Trump and destabilise the electorate in the hope of the deep-state candidate, the lackey of the British banking empire, getting in and doing their bidding to promote war with Russia, China and the Middle East thus keeping the bankrupt western banks afloat against the huge gold assets of the Russians and Chinese. If you seek balanced and independent reporting, it’s best to use zerohedge and Laroche , where you can get balance, insight and truth, rather than this BBC chewing gum for the easily led. Also bear in mind that the federal reserve bank in the USA is pumping $100 billion A DAY into failing banks.
Comment71	"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Parnas_and_Igor_Fruman"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Parnas_and_Igor_Fruman</a><br /><br />Is everyone going to ignore that they&#39;re clearly Israel lobbyists and perhaps Mossad assets trying to influence American politics. Forreal"
Comment72	What happened?<br />WINNING<br />AND MORE WINNING!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Comment73	All you libs and foreigners can go suck your selves. Trump 2020
Comment74	Well done.  I like the crime drama music.  Nice touch.
Comment75	We confirmed that Americans are insane now let find out if they are lawless.
Comment 75.1	@Youhaw Redrum also Putin a one party democracy he does not approve of communism his current dictatorship benefit him better, it is very similar how our dictatorship run, however ours is run by the corporations and uses patsy like Trump as a middle man.<br /><br />Unlike you the right wing conservatives i as a conservative left from the green party wants to end corruption and the way to do that is to end the handouts to the mega corporations, you don&#39;t give a person who looks at you like a cheap product to be used to wipe their buts and thrown away more power.<br /><br />Your nothing to them you grew up in public schools why would the care about you at all how very delusional, they never talked to you never hung out with you, to them it funny that you think your people.
Comment 75.2	@Youhaw Redrum that a dumb comeback i am a social democrat not a communist, i am against all forms of communism including backwards communism known as trickle down economic.
Comment 75.3	@Youhaw Redrum did i hurt your feelings, oh poor baby clearly the U.S. constitution is to harsh for your right wing delicate mind.<br /><br />I fully support impeaching Trump and Biden for committing the same criminal offence.
Comment 75.4	@Jim Butler as an American if i had the answers i would let you know, due to our president annoying our military corporations, i not sure if impeachment proves we have laws it just proves you don&#39;t annoy the war business.
Comment 75.5	That’s what we want to know too.
Comment76	quid pro quo?  oh my. That’s sounds worse than collusion 😮
Comment 76.1	Doesn&#39;t matter.  The quid was already a felony.  Asking a foreign leader for dirt on a political opponent is a felony, whether or not you actually get it.
Comment77	So much spin I&#39;m dizzy.
Comment 77.1	@Helmsman *30 years
Comment 77.2	You&#39;ve been spun for 3 years snowflake.
Comment 77.3	Glad to see that your roubles came through!
Comment 77.4	Dai spin?You’ve not been watching the news. Republicans are starting to come forward saying that the time has come for impeachment.
Comment78	For any Brits actually reading this. The House has the votes to impeach. They will keep doing what they are doing as long as poll for Impeach AND Remove numbers keep rising. This turkey needs to be perfectly roasted and it&#39;s all in the timing. The Senate will not remove Trump unless the poll numbers say to remove Trump. As long as those numbers keep going that way the House will wait. The House wants to see some chair leather wear from Republican butts squirming in the Senate :).
Comment 78.1	@hater gater He IS going to be Impeached. He is NOT going to be convicted.
Comment 78.2	He&#39;s not going to be impeached, get over it
Comment79	More fake news from the BBC. There is no legitimate impeachment proceeding, just more anti-Trump hot air from the desperate dems
Comment 79.1	@Jim Butler Apparently you haven&#39;t followed that these are all never-Trump lice who would say anything to protect the swamp. Zero actual evidence.
Comment 79.2	@Jim Butler Say NO to drugs
Comment 79.3	Apparently you have not been following the news. Half a dozen people have Testified that they were disturbed by trumps activities and that there was a quid pro quo. There is now more than enough evidence for impeachment. Even Republicans are starting to come forward asking for impeachment. Next week is going to be interesting.
Comment 79.4	The impeachment is all but a done deal.  When it&#39;s official, will you close your eyes and insist it never happened?  lol  Trump is going to be one of only three Presidents ever to be officially impeached.  If he doesn&#39;t stop acting crazy and shut his mouth, he may be yet be removed from office, too.  Say hello to President Pence.
Comment 79.5	A B C facts
Comment80	Moreover, President Trump has actually asked Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens, and he did so on national television. If this is illegal, he has already incriminated himself - what need for an &#39;impeachment inquiry&#39;? <br /><br /><br />I&#39;ll tell you why. President Trump&#39;s enemies don&#39;t have the numbers to impeach him even in the House of Representatives. They already held an impeachment vote and lost enormously. The purpose of the &#39;impeachment inquiry&#39; is to hold a cloud over the President to try and disrupt his re-election, which is essentially guaranteed.
Comment 80.1	@Jim Piper &quot;They&quot; are the members of the House of Representatives. Democrats have the votes to impeach in the House. It take a simple majority in the House to impeach. Pelosi has the votes to impeach. It takes a 2/3 majority to convict the President in the Senate and Democrats do not have the votes in the Senate to convict.
Comment 80.2	Who is &#39;they?&#39;  You&#39;re wrong.  No official votes have been held in either the House or Senate.
Comment 80.3	Nope. The House has the votes to impeach. They will keep doing what they are doing as long as poll for Impeach AND Remove numbers keep rising. This turkey needs to be perfectly roasted and it&#39;s all in the timing. The Senate will not remove Trump unless the poll numbers say to remove Trump. As long as those numbers keep going that way the House will wait. Nancy (speaker of the House in case any Brits are reading) wants to see some chair leather wear from Republican butts squirming in the Senate :).
Comment81	This charlatan &#39;journalist&#39; is with a straight face trying to convince his viewers and readers that the US government withholding military aid to Ukraine is somehow illegal.<br /><br /><br />1) Why is the Ukrainian automatically entitled to US taxpayer dollars?<br />2) The transcripts show no quid pro quo re Joe Biden<br />3) Even if the transcripts did show this (they don&#39;t), should a man be exempt from criminal investigation for apparent public corruption just because he is a potential rival of the sitting US President? In other words - run for President and you are exempt from criminal investigation and prosecution!<br /><br /><br />The BBC is manifestly biased. Folks, this is not news - this is an organisation that wants to take down President Trump.
Comment82	hurr durr false flag. Hurr durr globalist-soros conspiracy.
Comment83	he must be impeached for his criminal complicity in the non-judicial, extra-judicial summary execution of american legal resident and washington post reporter jamal khashoggi at the arabian consulate in istanbul turkey.
Comment 83.1	bin salman would never dare to kill khashoggi without trump&#39;s pre-approval.
Comment84	more BBC propaganda
Comment85	just read the transcript you IDIOT  theres nothing there READ
Comment86	Impeach n imprison him and his gang !
Comment87	Fake &#39;News&#39; Zurcher has been predicting President Trump&#39;s imminent downfall since his early candidacy. BBC &#39;News&#39; obvious anti-Trump bias is embarrassing.
Comment 87.1	@Meg Rosoff They have banged on about the end of Trump for nearly three years now, will they give it a goddamn rest already.
Comment 87.2	Thank god someone&#39;s &quot;bias&quot; is anti-Moron.
Comment88	How can Americans not be utterly embarrassed by their president??
Comment 88.1	You don&#39;t understand other people&#39;s perspective so you just make vague snarky comments
Comment 88.2	Only anti American filth dislikes the president. And foreign operatives like yourself.
Comment 88.3	because he&#39;s making America great again!
Comment 88.4	WE ARE!
Comment89	Iron your shirt
Comment 89.1	Yes mommy
Comment90	MAGA !
Comment91	What happened to EPSTEIN and Prince Andrew?
Comment 91.1	Can yall stfu about epstein
Comment92	Me? I&#39;m just here to irritate Trump minions, as it&#39;s great fun!
Comment93	Why are ur politicians so dumb?
Comment94	So why don’t they vote ? Another which hunt ? If they don’t vote they are not serious and just wasting time and money.
Comment95	“Nothing Burger” and “ I love how They...”. <br />Both phrases my 10 year old has said for 2 years to try to get out of something she’s hiding. Same as this most juvenile POTUS and supporters .  SPIN and Deflect from the truth.  So very sad.
Comment 95.1	@Henree Henry Go ahead in live in denial, idiot. It will only make his next win that much more satisfying ;)
Comment 95.2	Gyges Lyceum  HAAAAAA!  Still hanging on to “He Won, had biggest crowds”  blah blah blah.  Ok U Stable Genius, Chosen One. Go drink more Peach Kool-Aid and call it a night.<br />Again, soooooo Sad.
Comment 95.3	Typical progressive butt-hurt loser. Face it, Trump won, and he will win again in 2020.
Comment96	libtards keep dreaming
Comment97	Zurcher giving his opinion on things he knows nothing about. No mention of Pelosi stating that there will be no impeachment vote. That would mean they&#39;d have to stop looking for evidence they still can&#39;t find. Like Russiagate this will run and run on supposition, rumor and hearsay. Zurcher wrote lies about that as well. This moron gets all his fake news from Twitter.
Comment 97.1	@Andrew Jones Productions You&#39;re forgetting that Joe Biden boasted about threatening to withhold aid unless Ukraine fired their prosecutor who was investigating Burisma. A company that not only had Hunter Biden on the payroll but also a former CIA high level operative. You&#39;re also forgetting that once you start down this road you can&#39;t complain when it will inevitably be used against the Dems. Because they&#39;ve done exactly the same kind of shit. That&#39;s politics. You criticize the other side for doing exactly what you just did. Then you keep on lying and misrepresenting. Politco did an expose on Biden about how his relatives kept ending up with sinecure positions on the boards of billion dollar corporations in every country Joe visited, Then when Trump quoted their story about Biden Politico claimed it was a conspiracy theory. One they published ffs.
Comment 97.2	Derek Kent: You are forgetting the transcript of this call that is an official White House document. That in itself is evidence of unethical behaviour and Mulvaney&#39;s admission at a White House press conference also is an official statement. Your gormless president is nothing but a scoundrel and a liar. If you haven&#39;t worked that out by now you are just as stupid as him.
Comment 97.3	It figures that you and the rest of Trump&#39;s cult members would all be shameless, but really  obvious, compulsive liars, too.  Trump admits to felonies on national television, and you STILL try to claim there&#39;s no evidence?!  lol  Pelosi says she doesn&#39;t need a vote to START the impeachment investigation.  People under investigation don&#39;t get to dictate how the investigation gets done.  The vote to impeach comes later.  Pelosi waited until she had more than enough votes for that before she even made the announcement.
Comment98	Trump 2020!
Comment 98.1	LOL…..
Comment99	This Asshat has zero evidence &amp; no smoking gun.  Just like with Mueller.
Comment100	Funny thumbnail
Comment101	TRUMP IS UNIMPEACHABLE, HE IS GOD SENT,HE IS A GENIUS AND HE HAD KEPT HIS PROMISES,YOU BRITS DON&#39;T LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE MAKES THE KINGDOM OR THE QUEENDOM PAY THEIR BILLS. HE WILL SURVIVE 20  IMPEACHMENT ATTEMPTS BECAUSE HE IS A VERY HIGH ENERGY PERSONALITY UNLIKE YOUR VERY  LOW ENERGY PRINCE CHARLES
Comment102	And the ultimate result will be NOTHING. Just like the Muller report.
Comment 102.1	@SupremeAJC <br />&quot;...the investigation did not establish that members of Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its elections interference activities.&quot;<br />-The Muller Report
Comment 102.2	Tepes Obrejac me and you both know that’s a lie 👍🏾
Comment103	the word Saga that comes here ,donn know if contains the meaning of the act <br />impeachment of Trump ,like the Muller fooler ,was all distraction of real crimes and forbidden relations remaining from previous US admins and going on full force today
Comment104	How about you tell us about the Prince and Epstein relationship.
Comment 104.1	The BBC would hardly do that. There is insight in the Laroche and zerohedge news sites if you look for dependable facts. The BBC is for red-top readers only. Best to leave them to it.
Comment 104.2	No, thanks.  I don&#39;t care about that.  Members of the royal family are powerless, but there&#39;s no way to impeach them.
Comment 104.3	so what？ So many evil that the most disgusting deplorable becomes a saint?
Comment105	This idiot is listening to the lying corrupt Democrats, why don&#39;t they interview these people under oath with the Republicans present on tv instead behind closed doors (kangaroo court).  The Bias Broadcasting Corporation are like the Democrats and MSM only give out fake news.
Comment106	Worry about your shit hole Europe lol Americans are thriving
Comment 106.1	People in comments of yt videos liking Europe and disliking America is delusional. And I&#39;m from Europe too
Comment107	I&#39;m an American and I&#39;m EMBARASSED....
Comment 107.1	Youhaw Redrum run along now little boy
Comment 107.2	Youhaw Redrum the good ol ur not a good person argument
Comment 107.3	Nah, just an American citizen, but your comment is very troll-worthy.... LOL.
Comment 107.4	I guess you love to kiss foreign ass!
Comment 107.5	You should be the way sleepy joe totally bribed Ukraine govt to stop an investigation into burisma
Comment108	How is trump the best president ever? All he does is bankrupt companies, projects and now country! Nice resume!
Comment109	I&#39;ve heard Trump &amp; Cronies call the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional, illicit and invalid, yet nobody explains HOW it&#39;s any of these three. The US Constitution clearly states &quot;The House of Representatives shall have sole power of impeachment.&quot; It&#39;s that simple, so I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s unconstitutional, illicit or invalid. Also, John Bolton will be one of Trump&#39;s main insiders who&#39;s going to testify about the whole affair as he saw it. It&#39;s believed he &quot;resigned&quot; (or was fired, depending on who&#39;s tweeting) not too long ago because of the whole Ukraine thing. Being on the BBC page, it&#39;s worth noting Dr. Fiona Hill was born in the UK, and has been praised by many House representatives on the Intelligence committee of being one of the best witnesses they&#39;ve ever had testifying before them. She was there as a former Trump aide, who is an expert on Russia.
Comment 109.1	You are very naive. You should not follow MSM it is 90% fake news.
Comment 109.2	They need to vote on it before its legit
Comment110	BBC is going way too far left.  Yikes!
Comment111	And yet again the BBC gets it wrong. There was a quid pro quo involving getting Biden dirt and DNC servers. Useless fkn government mouthpiece.
Comment112	Impeaching Old Bone Spurs is a big mistake.  With him on the 2020 ballot the Republicans will get decimated and the Democrats can take back our country from the billionaire oligarchs.
Comment113	Who is this clown
Comment 113.1	David Dykes cool
Comment 113.2	@LiL HawK Like me, you&#39;re entitled to believe whatever you like, right? I personally find him both humorous, and factual - I see no bias. Have a sparkling day!
Comment 113.3	David Dykes this guy is clearly biased and is leaving out a lot of relevant information. He doesn’t look like a credible journalist and literally looks and sounds like a clown
Comment 113.4	Actually, everything he bought-up is factual - why are you calling him a &quot;clown&quot;?
Comment114	The only thing that happened was <b>Quid Pro Quo Joe</b> is losing the Democratic race due to meddling in the ukraine investigation into his son and sons company <b>Burisma Holdings.</b><br />Trump on the other hand <b>didn&#39;t offer any quid pro quo to President Selenksy,</b> plus just had a brilliant rally in texas and will win a second term because the <b>do nothing Democrats</b> haven&#39;t a pot to pee in plus Dem Elijah Cummings is dead to so great week. <br /><b>TRUMP 2020.</b> 🇬🇧🇺🇲👌🏼
Comment115	A lot of head and house pictures .. just want to know where should you put Xi and Beijing’s picture behind this? No no .. don’t say there is nothing to do with China .. unless you get money from them ..
Comment116	Meanwhile.. tRUMP is being led on a leash ‘lap dog’d’ by Putin.. Republicans continue to look away as they continue to support his actions while grappling with the insanity of it all. That, as unsalvageable as tRUMPS actions have been for America, he’s continued to be allowed a WH occupancy to further weaken our Democracy and Security. “Since, apparently all roads do Lead to Putin”.<br /><br />The WH chief of staff admitted to a Quid Pro Quo with Ukraine. YES Mulvaney, we’ll all “Get over it”!!! When this lawless POTUS/administration are all out of office. Specifically, for complicity to corruption, not limited to foreign voter meddling, by allowing tRUMP/family to utilize the WH (through federal taxpayer dollars) as a wheelhouse for personal gain. While the GOP/Senate, idles by and does nothing? now holding the G7 summit at his personal resort while Americans pick up the tab?!? America is being ‘TAXED’ while continually hearing about this process of impeachment, while republicans attempt to save face by pretending Our laws mean nothing. tRUMP and his cronies need immediately stopped, and escorted by officials out of the Oval Office/DC (reminded they are all civil servants) and imprisoned for corruption!!!
Comment 116.1	too true!   As a former GOPer......it&#39;s feels surreal that our so-called &quot;conservative&quot; party could be co-opted by the (ex) commies!
Comment 116.2	<b>WRONG!</b><br />Trump release the recording of the conversation, there is no quid pro quo from Trump, sit down shut up.
Comment117	From Quid Pro Quo, to Quid Pro No, to Quid Pro So, to Quid Pro Doh.
Comment 117.1	@Tourniquet Now Nope. Only 4-5. Even Putin trolls cannot tell more lies than Trump.
Comment 117.2	This account has posted this same pathetic post on over 40 anti Trump mainstream media videos.<br />Crazy how the marxist left has to try so hard...
Comment 117.3	Interesting Defense that one. Not sure if it belongs in a Law Library, or in a Library of Psychiatrics.
Comment118	Trump 2020

Comment 120.1	Is this a &#39;Young Frankenstein&#39; reference? Pretty funny when I hear it that way...
Comment121	I didn’t do it. Reminds me of the Simpsons.
Comment 121.1	@PUAlum the sooner, the sooner.<br />It can&#39;t be soon enough.<br />G.W Bush
Comment 121.2	Waiting for Trump&#39;s, &quot;Doh!!&quot; moment.   The sooner the.....sooner.
Comment 121.3	Go and watch the halloween episode song - Just Don&#39;t Look... Can&#39;t help but think Lard Lad looks an awful lot like someone that we should have just simply ignored from the beginning; the idea of the song being that some monstrosities only exist because we give them our undivided attention.
Comment 121.4	Yeah, sure does.
Comment122	The United States of America will be GREAT again<br /><br />when every headline in world reads YOU&#39;RE FIRED!
Comment 122.1	When you&#39;re spoon fed biased bullshit though.

Comment126	Donald does&#39;t know anything else about two soviet spies with Ukraine ( Donald is lying for 20,000 corruptions 🍬🍭)
Comment127	Does the BBC weekly follow that pathetic &quot;witch hunting&quot; style Washington DC elitist never ending political coup try saga against the 100% legally without any kind of collusion or supernatural Russian magic and witchcraft elected US President Donald Trump? The US President´s possible impeachment is 100% a political process in the US Congress, not a legal system process, and it needs 2/3 political majority in the US Senate. Believe me, the politically desperate US Democrats will never achieve it in the US Senate were the Republican Party has majority. Increasingly desperate leading Democrats fear to challenge bully and eccentric way charmant and politically charismatic President Donald Trump in the late autumn 2020 US Presidential election politically. They don´t want to talk about the real problems and needed reforms in the USA. They are only under leadership of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi perverse way obsessed to President Trump. Is that old witch of the Democratic Party secretly in love or what? President Trump then was again his legendary himself as an epic American idiot when he met the Italian President Sergio Mattarella at the White House. Later he did tweet: &quot;The United States and Italy are bound together by a shared cultural and political heritage dating back thousands of years to Ancient Rome&quot;. The Roman Empire was founded in 753 BC and it was commonly based on fascism and it copied culturally significantly the ancient classical Hellenic Culture where especially Sparta was based on very militaristic fascism and won at a long war the elitist way democratic culturally and economically advanced Athens. Young homosexual Macedonian Warlord and King Alexander the Great, who was a son of the homosexual King Philip II of Macedon, who was murdered by one of his homosexual lovers, made the Hellenic culture great all around his huge conquered Hellenic Empire that was the historical and cultural base of the rise and greatness of the European Western Civilization, which historical global cultural and political power highlight point was before the WWI when the European colonial Empires and the fast power rising USA practically military ruled the world and dominated the world culturally too. Only the rising Japanese Empire, which had industrially, economically, educationally and partly culturally adopted the European civilization in Far East had enough economic, industrial, cultural and military power to resist the European Civilization´s global invasion before the WWI. The USA then was founded on July 4, 1776 AD and became Confederation March 1, 1781 AD, when the Western part of the Roman Empire collapsed 476 AD and modern Russia together with some other Eastern European countries, Greece included, continue today the cultural and religious tradition of the Eastern Part of the collapsed historical Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, which did last to 1453 AD. The Washington DC monumental architecture is an early 19th century US style copy of the ancient Roman Empire´s and the Hellenic Empire´s monumental architecture style commonly, though they didn´t understand in the USA during that era that the ancient Greek and Roman buildings were commonly very colourful, not white.

Comment128	HaHa! Do you idiots at the BBC really believe Trump is going to be impeached? When will you fools learn. Trump 2020!👍
Comment129	What is this the resistance?
Comment 129.1	What is the Resistance? It&#39;s a group of people who can read, write, are articulate, intelligent, devoted to the principles of the American Constitution, don&#39;t rely on vulgarity and potty talk to make a point and much more.  Their motto is:<br />       &quot;Never trust a man who calls his own daughter &quot;a piece of a$$ because any man who&#39;ll screw his own daughter will screw his own country.&quot; Good motto!

Comment138	FREE ASSANGE
Comment139	This guy should move to the Washington Post or CNN. This piece would make an ideal pitch to show at the interview. Love also the clownish music and cartoon-ish graphics because, lets face it, we really are that stupid.
Comment 139.1	Professor Manque . Ha ha. Tell that to the bankers. None so blind as those that will not see.
Comment 139.2	Nathan Levesque Thanks. Glad you agree.
Comment 139.3	@Annyai Presoski Everyone you disagree with is part of a conspiracy. Brilliant job figuring that out.
Comment 139.4	&quot;Deep state&quot; is a delusion of stupid uneducated folks incapable of grappling with the complexity and nuance of foreign policy, silly children who can only reduce reality to a spy comic book thriller
Comment 139.5	This guy is simply articulate at repeating the deep state message for the more intelligent thinkers who are duped into thinking he’s telling the truth and ‘informing’ them. All governments are corrupt, but at least this one has managed to resist the deep state coup and keep the country out of the perpetual war cycle. When they get him out, the we will be back at war in a matter of weeks.  Try zero hedge or Laroche for a more balanced insight.

Comment 141.2	Galen Marek “I think the whole thing is boring,&quot; Ocasio-Cortez, 29, said Thursday at the Queens Library event. &quot;He should have been impeached a long time ago. I&#39;m over it.

Comment144	Ànother nothing burger.
Comment145	It&#39;s simple. You have to choose between Trump with jobs, great economy and liberty or the democratic party communism and lies and manipulations.
Comment 145.1	And that is why our Captain Steve Rogers can not see you eye to eye when it comes to government and oversight, Mr. Stark.
Comment 145.2	Didn’t realize Trump made every single job over the past three years. The President doesn’t make jobs or improve the economy, stop giving him credit for everything
Comment 145.3	@Tony Stark Trump bankrupted 2 casinos and lost a billion dollars in a 10 year period. Who the fuck looks at that and says &quot;There&#39;s someone I&#39;d do business with.&quot; Trump&#39;s resorts business have gone down 63 percent. And this is the idiot, idiots like you put in charge of the nation&#39;s business. lol
Comment 145.4	@Florida Crypto R Trump&#39;s IQ is above-average because is successful at many areas. He won the presidency on a small budget. That&#39;s not coincidence.
Comment146	Anthony Zurcher is no better than CNN.
Comment147	Keep the heat on Trump. Push, push, push and give him no rest, no peace. Let there be no place on this planet where he can find solace and comfort. Let his days be filled with people striving against him and may his nights be sleepless and filled with fear and anxiety. Keep the heat on and he&#39;ll break. Make all of his days a living Hell and all of his nights a waking nightmare and he&#39;ll break. He&#39;ll meltdown and do it on camera. Make him have a burning hatred for his own life. He will break.
Comment 147.1	@pablo9364 Sound about right.
Comment 147.2	@pablo9364   Yep. Probably so. There&#39;s a lot of those out there.
Comment 147.3	DANNYBOY73 probably not a real account.  Fake commenter of something.
Comment 147.4	@DANNYBOY73    You mean they actually named a mental illness after Trump? Well, that&#39;s OK with me but actually, I&#39;m surprised it doesn&#39;t have the word &quot;penis&quot; in it.
Comment148	American here and under Article 13 a lawyer in the United States. This article they just displayed was the aspect of talking about the vice presidency under Obama not President Trump you edited the film to look like that plus there was no relation to a person during the clip so you can apply it to anybody.  Busted busted BUSTED CAUGHT RED HANDED!!!!! LMFAO

Comment151	They said they are not holding a vote meaning they literally  plan on just caterwauling. Why don&#39;t  you cover Harry running all over the world while screaming  climate change.
Comment 151.1	@Amber Again I said near landslide my uneducated friend scroll up. The fact is that Trump won by 70 electoral votes which 30%More than required meaning Hillary  had a huge gap in the real votes that count. You see you win States to become president once again you show your uneducated  state. Subscribe to me and I will enlighten your weak fragile vacuous mind and fill it with fact truth and love for humanity for only in competition shall we prosper. You could win 5 States  and have a popular  vote. Unless you are a state your vote doesn&#39;t  count.
Comment 151.2	@SuperVillain Politics I want her to bet on her life.<br />She has the classic case of Trump derangement syndrome.
Comment 151.3	SuperVillain Politics obama won in a landslide not trump. And I’m uneducated? You think 46 states will turn red over impeachment. I’m perfectly aware of how my country elects a president. And impeaches one. When you lose the popular vote by that much there is no way you won the electoral college by a landslide. Your insults are lame and don’t make your argument any stronger.
Comment 151.4	@Amber Again Popular vote means nothing. Once again you show you are uneducated. 270 is what is needed to win so when you hit 70ish you are near landslide and Obama won in a landslide.
Comment 151.5	SuperVillain Politics that’s not a huge win. Obama beat Romney by 126. Landslide? Lost the popular vote by over 2 million. There was no landslide.
Comment152	The better question is why is the BBC not unbiased anymore?
Comment 152.1	Welsh independence now annibyniaeth Cymru nawr hahaha I didn’t even watch the video, I seen the picture for it and the title and just commented although I’m pretty sure the bias is guaranteed from the biased broadcasting corporation... seems to me like you’re the only cry baby here, since you are the one that spat out your herbal tea and are now probably cowering in your safe space, poor diddums... have you tried getting someone to wind you maybe? I think It’ll help you👶😆🖕🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🖕🏻
Comment 152.2	Welsh independence now annibyniaeth Cymru nawr oh are they really just presenting the facts . LOL  srs
Comment 152.3	The Liquor no bias here crybaby, they’re just presenting the facts about the current state of impeachment proceedings against junkie Donald, and the facts don’t care about your feelings
Comment 152.4	Your right.  There is a reason for certain.  I’m not sure what it is.  But I think the reason is connected with our government and corruption of some degree
Comment153	This is disgusting . I’ve never heard so much sewage in my life spewed out by the BBC.  Seriously. Research the real facts and for opinions from more credible sources
Comment 153.1	@Amber Again Medicine time for you cum dumpster.
Comment 153.2	Rory The Red no this video was fine. No blinkers on here.
Comment 153.3	@Amber Again Take the blinkers off and escape the BBC / Pravda echo chamber.
Comment 153.4	pablo9364 I see nothing unreal.
Comment154	Not a good report! If Trump is impeached it will be for what happened in the first week this broke - and on the evidence of THOSE players. What&#39;s coming out now is mainly Froth and smoke. Congress needs to stick to FACTS (and not Political infighting / Rep vs. Dem). Trump pissed down the back of the American constitution (whilst in office) and then told everyone it was raining! AND THAT IS AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENCE WHAT EVER YOUR PARTY!. Perhaps the people of the USA no longer deserve democracy if this is what they do with it.
Comment 154.1	@Ziggy Mon Dear Ziggy. This is not a personal comment. I think the best link is the Presidential Oath of Office . - Mr Trump swore to it , no one else. Whether a Rep or a Dem if you break the oath …. well, you break it. Simples!
Comment 154.2	So did Obama, why ain&#39;t his ass getting dragged into this then.
Comment 154.3	&quot;Trump pissed down the back of the American constitution&quot; ?<br />Link(s) Please - Not personal/politicized comments ?<br /><br />WWG1WGA Trump is uncovering the Deep State <br />That is What We Wanted
Comment 154.4	HAHAHAHA  prove it !!!
Comment 154.5	NIGEL EVANS well said
Comment155	This week... dems bitched about impeachment. Same as every week
Comment 155.1	@DANNYBOY73 do you think being wilfully ignorant some how gives you a point. You wanted a link and the evidence is right in front of you; yet you deny it. Stay stupid kiddo.
Comment 155.2	@Peoples Republic of Ninj What the video the BBC have put together, I&#39;d rather not listen/watch it thanks, its anti Trump propaganda.<br /><b>No quid pro quo from Trump, but there is from Creepy Joe Biden.</b>
Comment 155.3	@DANNYBOY73 it&#39;s in the video you muppet!
Comment 155.4	@Peoples Republic of Ninj Links.
Comment 155.5	WH admitted to commiting high crimes and misdemeanors, don&#39;t forget that bit.
Comment156	Yawn!! Wake me up when you&#39;re over losing.
Comment 156.1	@Richard KL44357   Ah, you&#39;re just trolling. If you really wanted Muslims to die, you&#39;d have already killed some yourself. Your mouth is brave but your feet are cowards. You&#39;re just trolling.
Comment 156.2	@88Gibson LesPaul  yes I&#39;m ok with it all as long as muslims are dying I&#39;m very very GOOD
Comment 156.3	You&#39;re asleep, or so you say, but the rest of us are awake. We&#39;ve seen Trump give the OK to genocide and we&#39;re hearing the voices of dead and maimed Kurdish children calling out for Justice. That you can sleep when innocent people are being murdered makes you the perfect Trump-Putin disciple.
Comment157	Democrats aren’t impeaching him...... just listen to the goofy music, it’s a joke not meant to be taken seriously
Comment 157.1	@Amber Again wouldn&#39;t worry about Danny boy his channel is just video games. In other words he&#39;s a 13 year old who&#39;s just discovered his genitals and know effall about anything except acne.
Comment 157.2	@Amber Again Proof, if not sit down and shut, Trump released the transcript, he&#39;s baited Nancy to impeach him, she&#39;s backed off, all because they isn&#39;t any evidence of any wrong doing.<br />Get help for your <b>TRUMP DERANGEMENT ANXIETIES.</b>
Comment 157.3	Luke Osborne well I haven’t. Pelosi hasn’t.  The inquiry is happening and there are enough democrats in the house to impeach without a single republican vote. He will be impeached for sure.
Comment158	Tard
Comment159	The mess he made in Syria more than points out how much he is willing to do if he doesn&#39;t get his way.<br />What will be his next dangerous tantrum?
Comment 159.1	You can thank O&#39;Bummer for the mess Syria is in, and you can thank Trump for cleaning it up, remember no more ISIS clown.
Comment 159.2	The USA only assisted in defeating ISIS in Syria, they were not meant to remain In Country indefinitely. You want to save the Kurds then lobby the EU to send European boys to fight &amp; die for a change.
Comment 159.3	It will be whatever the fake news decide to make up and I guarantee as we get nearer the 2020 elections it will be something BIG
Comment 159.4	Why don&#39;t you send your kids to fight in Syria mate?
Comment 159.5	Warmonger
Comment160	You know, Caesar&#39;s Senators stabbed him to death over some of the same bullshit Trump is trying to pull! Except Caesar&#39;s Senators weren&#39;t to chicken shit to protect the Republic from him!
Comment161	Totally misrepresented Mulvany&#39;s comments. <br /><br />More leftist garbage and more wasteful spending of British pounds. <br /><br />BBC sucks
Comment162	I&#39;ll save you 3 minutes. Nothing.  More noise from the dems.
Comment 162.1	@David Dykes see you at the polls Dykes.
Comment 162.2	Having a bit of an issue with the truth, Jeff High? Are you high????? LOL....
Comment 162.3	@Amber Again 🤫
Comment 162.4	Jeff High nothing is getting him impeached then
Comment163	I&#39;m Asian..I want to more news about Catalonia please..
Comment164	What an absolute nothingburger.  But of course that&#39;s not the point, the point is just sheer noise and repetition.
Comment 164.1	@gurugeorge 👍🏼
Comment 164.2	@gurugeorge Sounds like a dance tune &quot;in the bouse&quot;
Comment 164.3	@SadHappy She can&#39;t explain, the clueless bint she is, she should go make us a sandwich and cuppa.
Comment 164.4	@Amber Again Well the <i>allegations</i> (the impeachment in that sense, the <i>formal content</i> of it) are up to the house to formulate, but until the senate tries him <i>and finds him guilty as charged,</i> they&#39;re just allegations and no actual impeachment has occurred.  And none will, because the allegations are bunk, as anyone can discover just by reading the text of the phone call.
Comment165	Erdogan threw Trump&#39;s immoral letter into a trash can...Nerd like Trump, like American stupid people.  The choice of the American people will now have to suffer in the form of filth all over the world.  Next time, the American people will choose such a model and stupid lunatic.
Comment166	This is such an own goal for the Democrats. Pelosi doesn&#39;t even want to vote on the inquiry so changed the rules. There&#39;s Democrat congressmen in Republican districts and they did not want to vote as it would leave their seats very unsafe in 2020. It&#39;s the Senate that decides on impeachment and with a Republican majority that seems like a zero possibility. All Democrats want to do is obstruct  and retake power. Their hatred of Trump is that great that they can&#39;t and won&#39;t get over the 2020 election
Comment 166.1	@Amber Again You&#39;re embarrassing your self again.
Comment 166.2	stop Mass Hysteria I think he has little chance of winning again by the way. Barely won last time and he’s not gaining any new supporters with this behavior
Comment 166.3	stop Mass Hysteria it’s because he’s abusing his power. He withheld military aid for his political gain. He asked another leader (again) to interfere in our elections. Congress is doing their job. And Bill Clinton was impeached for less than this mess
Comment 166.4	@Amber Again yes the senate decides if he&#39;s to leave office. With Republicans in control there&#39;s little chance of that happening. Bill Clinton asked Tony Blair to help out in the dispute between British Airways and American Airways. There was no call for an inquiry into that. Why don&#39; Democrats concentrate on winning the next election instead of these endless inquiries. Is it because they have no message or contender that could beat Trump?
Comment167	No closer.
Comment168	Very good Erdoğan... Erdoğan is a sensible, virtuous and serviceable man.  The trump and its like, a symbol of stupidity and a terrorist activist.
Comment169	BBC giving you facts means anti Trump pro globalist agenda. <br /><br />(1) there&#39;s no such thing as an &#39;impeachement inquiry&#39;,  only  impeachment. <br /><br />(2) if there was impeachment thrn house needs a vote,  otherwise it is only Pelosi and Shifty going to impeach. <br /><br />(3) Pelosi,  two days ago, said no vote<br /><br />Personally, when dems get really desperate,  they will  push impeachment,  but Americans will punish them in the elections
Comment 169.1	The Reason Pelosi wants to keep it on &quot;Inquiry&quot; phase :<br />1 - It will elongate the process and create more time for their BS<br />2 - Allows Cherry~Picking of Topics and Denies selected persons the right to legal representation and that rebuttal - They can keep it One sided.<br /><br />Barr&#39;s interpretation is simply that #2 above cannot be &#39;Justified.&#39;
Comment 169.2	@Pete C Pete you can&#39;t tell Amber, she has the classic case of Trump derangement syndrome.
Comment 169.3	@Pete C I did answer. Learn to read. And learn the difference between a statue and a statute. God, Trump supporters are so effing stupid.
Comment170	BBC garbage “reporting”. Your bias fake is so pathetic, worse than cnn, you’re such a dick, people are seeing through you
Comment171	You misspelled Biden.
Comment172	Who worst BBC or CNN?<br />Both are really bad!
Comment 172.1	@DANNYBOY73 Fox News was never right LMFAO, god you&#39;re a moron.
Comment 172.2	@Rory The Red 👍🏼
Comment 172.3	@presterjohn71 You should do poetry.
Comment 172.4	@PUAlum No, that&#39;s CNN and the BBC.
Comment 172.5	@presterjohn71 Listen up silly, all investigations, especially the Mueller investigation are solely intended to find evidence of an offence, no investigation has ever been about exonerating the subject of the investigation. SMH
Comment173	You won&#39;t impeach shit, I suggest you start doing real news.
Comment174	They are trying to take Trump down like how they are trying to prevent brexit.
Comment175	What a bs ill researched summary. Biden and his son are totally corrupt leveraging massive prid pro quo backdoor payments from Ukraine and China. Biden was a main player in the Russian hoax against Trump working with the corrupt Ukrainian Government, in an attempt to overthrow him. The DOJ needs to investigate these matters urgently and prosecute accordingly and you need to get a day job, just saying.
Comment176	SHIFTY SCHIFF AND HIS SUSPICIONS VISITS TO HIS DONAR SEX PREDITOR FRIEND ED BUCK THAT  HAS BEEN TYING UP YOUNG BLACK MEN DRUGGING THEM THEN SEXUALLY ABUSING THEM <br />OMG THIS IS HOW DESPERATE DEMOCRATS ARE LOL
Comment177	Anthony Zurcher ; is he &#39;of the tribe&#39;?
Comment 177.1	Oy vey!
Comment178	The BBC are part of the modern day aristocracy: metropolitan, middle-class Marxists. Separated from reality, and swimming in government cheddar, these narcissists will do whatever possible to fuel their ego. <br /><br />Pensioners need contractors banging on their door to pay up for the BBC. How else will anyone function without Londoners patronising them?
Comment 178.1	Yeah, dem&#39; Brits use them big words - no fair....LOL.
Comment 178.2	hater gater if that’s true it’s very sad indeed.  Self preservation I guess
Comment 178.3	@pablo9364 <br />One issue is that the internet has ruined the audience numbers for classical media giants, so they have to choose some radical, click-bait position to get views. CNN was left wing, but they are feeding on the anti-Trump crowd so they can sell ads to them
Comment 178.4	hater gater if you think the bbc is in anyway Marxist you’re as thick as pig shit
Comment 178.5	hobo dog it all reinforces the corrupt world we live in.  With government orientated networks like BBC and private networks like Global radio and CNN with political agendas of their own . Very sad situation.  Wouldn’t it be great if things were done solely for the people and not for other reasons such as greed, personal gain, power and self preservation of various organisations
Comment179	start from 2015
Comment180	I suspect trumps impeachment as a  link with turkey&#39;s action😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Comment181	79 YEAR OLD GANSTER PELOSI HAS DONE NOTHING FOR HER VOTERS THAT ARE LIVING IN TENTS ALL OVER THE CITY STREETS URINATING AND POOPING ON THE STREETS WHERE THEY LIVE <br />EEEEEWWWWWW YUK BECAREFUL YOU DON&#39;T PICK UP  DISEASES THERE
Comment182	you want a subpoena? here you go take them like they’re cookies 🍪
Comment 182.1	Peoples Republic of Ninj haha typo sorry subpoena~~
Comment 182.2	@Amber Again 👈🏻🤡 <b>Has entered chat.</b>
Comment 182.3	@Amber Again  I take it you have never been in a court case ,  you can say any thing you want or NOT , but no statement has any force or admission of guilt or NOT , until you are under oath in a court of law being tried.
Comment183	Informal.. The House hasn’t voted on it.
Comment 183.1	DANNYBOY73 that didn’t happen lol you have no facts
Comment 183.2	@Amber Again I ripped you the other day with facts and you kept regurgitating the same old shit, he&#39;s still president and he will be in 2020 🇬🇧🇺🇲👌🏼
Comment 183.3	DANNYBOY73 never. You call names and have nothing of substance to say
Comment 183.4	@Amber Again Yeah I debunked you in another thread, you&#39;re welcome Amber.
Comment 183.5	DANNYBOY73 yeah that’s not happening. Your name calling is super immature too. Grow up and learn to look up facts on your own
Comment184	At least we aren&#39;t run by a multinational bureaucracy, Limeys. You get a government and a PM that isn&#39;t second fiddle to Brussels and I&#39;ll take your opinions seriously.
Comment 184.1	@DJVEGAS1000 Well that&#39;s a subjective statement if I ever heard one.
Comment 184.2	@Adam O dunno m8 i dont work for the bbc. I just deal in facts
Comment 184.3	@Content &amp; Comments The facts are that funding was held because of legitimate corruption. Trump will survive this and come out whistling. You can&#39;t say the same for Biden.
Comment 184.4	Deflections does not negate the facts that those who do so are trying to avoid.
Comment 184.5	@DJVEGAS1000 When do you suppose the BBC will report on their Parliament selling it&#39;s constituents out to save their own wealth in the EU?
Comment185	SHIFTY SCHIFF CAUGHT OUT TRYING TO GET DIRT ON TRUMP FROM TWO RUSSIAN COMEDIANS <br />OMG HOW PATHETICALLY DESPERATE THE LEADERLESS DEMOCRATS ARE
Comment186	All of you fake news media have seen the phone call transcript and heard from the 2 conversant and yet sniffing around to set people up again! What does private sms b/w 2 colleagues hv to do with the president? Nothing 🤗🤗
Comment 186.1	@Amber Again Bet your life on instead that will be more fun.
Comment 186.2	@Amber Again 🤫
Comment 186.3	@Jon 66 No you&#39;ve seen the script, there no before or after, they released the transcript of Selenksy and Trump, the only Quid Pro Quo is from Joe Biden its on video on youtube.
Comment 186.4	@Amber Again 👈🏻😂 What you know you could write on the back of a stamp.
Comment 186.5	@Amber Again 👈🏻😂 Shut up you&#39;re embarrassing your self now.
Comment187	It would be easier to impeach him on the emoluments clause.
Comment 187.1	Dylan Edwards they control the senate. Democrats control the House
Comment 187.2	Blue Fall yes, the house will impeach trump
Comment 187.3	Dylan Edwards you’re right. Not only will he not be removed from office if he’s impeached, but he will also be pardoned by the next president which will he Pence obviously.
Comment 187.4	@Blue Fall I have heard that it is more likely, but either way it has to pass in the senate too, which it wont.
Comment 187.5	Dylan Edwards no I mean in the house would she have enough votes to pass impeachment articles
Comment188	Bruh
Comment189	They are so stupid they just contradicted them self
Comment 189.1	Yeah BBC do that all the time
Comment190	Like the video but the music was far too loud, too much of a distraction.
Comment 190.1	So much Fear...So much Noise.
Comment 190.2	Maybe spend a bit more on their visuals too.
